The Early Prostate Cancer (EPC) programme was a large clinical trial programme of monotherapy with the nonsteroidal antiandrogen bicalutamide (Casodex) plus standard care versus standard care alone in men with early prostate cancer.

The three trials in the EPC programme were as follows:

* Trial 23 (North America; n3292)
* Trial 24 (Europe Australia Israel South Africa and Mexico; n3603)
* Trial 25 (Scandinavia; n1218) (also known as the Scandinavian Prostate Cancer Group-6 (SPCG-6) study)

Several combined follow-up papers of the EPC programme results were published including at median 3.0years in August 2002 median 5.4years in November 2004 median 7.4years in February 2006 and median 9.7years in April 2010.

The EPC programme found that bicalutamide was effective in treating locally advanced prostate cancer. Conversely it was not effective for localized prostate cancer where there was instead a statistical significance
Liver safety is an important concern with bicalutamide. In the first analysis of the EPC programme at median 3.0years of follow-up abnormal liver function tests had occurred in 3.4% of men treated with bicalutamide and 1.9% of men with placebo. Clinically relevant increases in aspartate transaminase (AST) alanine transaminase (ALT) and bilirubin occurred in 1.6% 1.6% and 0.7% with bicalutamide and in 0.5% 0.3% and 0.4% with placebo. However liver changes with bicalutamide were usually transient and rarely severe. Abnormal liver function tests led to treatment withdrawal in 1.4% with bicalutamide and 0.5% with placebo. No cases of fatal hepatotoxicity occurred with bicalutamide in the SPCG-6 substudy of the EPC programme.
