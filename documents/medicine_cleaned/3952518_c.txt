Bilious vomiting syndrome in dogs is vomiting in response to bile-induced inflammation of the stomach.  It is also known as reflux gastritis syndrome and duodenal-gastric reflux.  Bile salts interfere with the gastric mucosal barrier allowing acid to irritate the stomach lining and cause gastritis.

Dogs with this condition usually vomit in the morning after not eating all night.  Treatment is to feed late at night.  Hâ‚‚-receptor antagonist
