File:A wounded bald eagle receiving follow-up treatment by University of Tennessee Veterinary Hospital. (16380229252).jpgAn avian veterinarian is a veterinarian who specializes in treating birds. All veterinarians upon first qualification from a certified veterinary college may treat any species. Additional training is required for qualification to become a recognized specialist in the care of birds. 

In the United States a veterinarian can specialize in avian medicine and surgery via post-graduate training through the American Board of Veterinary Practitioners and become a Diplomate of the American Board of Veterinary Practitioners (Avian Practice). Avian veterinarians can become members of the Association of Avian Veterinarians for additional education opportunities including a journal and an annual conference. 

In Europe veterinarians become recognized as avian specialists by qualifying as a Diplomate of the European College of Zoological Medicine (Avian) and in Australia and New Zealand by qualifying as a Member or Fellow of the Australian and New Zealand College of Veterinary Scientists.
