Borrelia anserina is a helical spirochete bacterium with dimensions around 8-20/02-03 Micrometre
Cultivation
In microbiological laboratories B. anserina bacteria can be grown on special protein-enriched media (rich in ovoalbumins or animal tissue (that contains myoglobin)) in wikt:anaerobicB. anserina used to be maintained in embryonic chicken eggs or by serial passages in domestic chickens until in 1986 it was discovered that it could be cultivated in Barbour-Stoenner-Kelly (BSK) medium which facilitated and made future research more cost-effective.

Pathogenity
B. anserina is a pathogenic agent for poultry (chickens turkeys ducks etc.) and causes a disease called borreliosis or spirochetosis. This bacterium is transmitted from bird to bird by ticks from the Argas and Ornitodorus<!-- Ornithodoros? --> genera. The major symptoms of an infection with B. anserina are: anemia diarrhea and severe neurological dysfunctions.
