Xanthochromism (also called xanthochroism or xanthism) from the Greek xanthos (ξανθός) "yellow" and chroma (χρώμα) "color" is an unusually yellow pigmentation in an animal. It is often associated with the lack of usual red pigmentation and its replacement with yellow.  The cause is usually genetic but may also be related to the animals diet.

Birds exhibiting genetic xanthochromism especially deliberately bred mutations of several species of parrot in aviculture are termed "lutinos".  Wild birds in which xanthochromism has been recorded include Yellow wagtail (disambiguation)
