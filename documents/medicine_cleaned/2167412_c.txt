Infectious hypodermal and hematopoietic necrosis (IHHN) is a Parvoviridae
The disease is caused by a single-stranded DNA virus of the species Decapod pestylhamaparvovirus 1 earlier known as IHHN virus the smallest of the known penaeid shrimp viruses (22&nbsp;nanometre
Virology
This virus has been classified as Penaeus stylirostris hamaparvovirus. The genome is 4.1 kilobases in length. There are three open reading frames in its genome:  a left non structural protein (NS1) of 2001 base pairs (bp) a mid non structural protein (NS2) of 1092 bp and a right capsid protein of 990 bp. NSI appears to be a DNA helicase with ATPase activity.

The mutation rate in the genome has been estimated to be ~1.4 x 10<sup>âˆ’4</sup> substitutions/site/year.<ref nameRobles-Sikisaka2011>Robles-Sikisaka R Bohonak AJ McClenaghan LR Jr Dhar AK (2010) Genetic signature of rapid IHHNV (infectious hypodermal and hematopoietic necrosis virus) expansion in wild Penaeus shrimp populations.
