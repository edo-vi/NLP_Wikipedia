The FinnProstate Group (FP) or FinnProstate Study Group is a group of scientific researchers in Finland who have conducted a series of clinical trials of treatments for prostate cancer. The first publication by the group was in 1985 and the latest publication was in 2019.

Clinical trials
The studies conducted by the FinnProstate group include the following:

* FinnProstate-1 (FinnProstate-I; Finnish Multicentre Study of Prostatic Cancer) – ethinylestradiol 150&nbsp;μg/day (1&nbsp;mg/day initially) plus polyestradiol phosphate 80&nbsp;mg/month (160&nbsp;mg/month initially) versus orchiectomy for advanced prostate cancer
* FinnProstate-2 (FinnProstate-II) – polyestradiol phosphate 160&nbsp;mg/month (with or without low-dose aspirin) versus orchiectomy for advanced prostate cancer
* FinnProstate-3 (FinnProstate-III) – cancelled
* FinnProstate-4 (FinnProstate-IV) – polyestradiol phosphate 160&nbsp;mg/month versus buserelin (with cyproterone acetate 300&nbsp;mg/day initially to prevent gonadotropin flare) in advanced prostate cancer* FinnProstate-5 (FinnProstate-V) – cancelled
* FinnProstate-6 (FinnProstate-VI) – polyestradiol phosphate 240&nbsp;month (320&nbsp;mg/month initially) versus orchiectomy for advanced prostate cancer
* FinnProstate-7 (FinnProstate-VII) – intermittent versus continuous androgen deprivation therapy for advanced prostate cancer
* Other studies by the FinnProstate group
