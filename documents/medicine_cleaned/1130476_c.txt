In traditional Chinese medicine the Small Intestine () is a fu Organ (anatomy)
The small intestine governs the separation of the clear from the turbid. The small intestine further digests food decomposed initially by the stomach. The clear referring to the essence of water and grain and to the large amount of fluid is absorbed by the spleen and distributed to the whole body. The turbid is sent downwards to the large intestine while the useless water is infused to the bladder. The disorders of the small intestine are attributable to failure to separate the clear from the turbid dirt in the digesting process manifesting stool and urinary disturbance such as abdominal pain diarrhea scanty urine etc.
