===Fictional quotations===
Some writers use as epigraphs fictional quotations that purport to be related to the fiction of the work itself. Examples include:

====In films====

====In literature====
* Some science fiction works, such as [[Isaac Asimov]]'s ''[[Foundation Trilogy]]'', [[Frank Herbert]]'s ''[[Dune (franchise)|Dune]]'' series, and [[Jack McKinney (writer)|Jack McKinney]]'s ''[[Robotech]]'' novelizations use quotations from an imagined future history of the period of their story.
* Fantasy literature may also include epigraphs.  For example, [[Ursula K. Le Guin|Ursula K. Le Guin's]] ''[[Earthsea]]'' series includes epigraphs supposedly quoted from the epic poetry of the Earthsea archipelago.
* [[Elizabeth C. Bunce]]'s Edgar Award-winning Myrtle Hardcastle mystery series, beginning with ''Premeditated Myrtle'' includes epigraphs by the fictional 19th century scholar H.M. Hardcastle at the beginning of each chapter of the five-book series.

**This cliché is parodied by [[Diana Wynne Jones]] in ''[[The Tough Guide To Fantasyland]]''.
* [[Jasper Fforde]]'s ''[[The Eyre Affair]]'' has quotations from supposedly future works about the action of the story.

* [[Stephen King]]'s ''[[The Dark Half]]'' has epigraphs taken from the fictitious novels written by the protagonist.
* [[Dean Koontz]]'s ''[[The Book of Counted Sorrows]]'' began as a fictional book of poetry from which Koontz would "quote" when no suitable existing option was available;  Koontz simply wrote all these epigraphs himself.  Many fans, rather than realizing the work was Koontz' own invention, apparently believed it was a real, but rare, volume; Koontz later collected the existing verse into an actual book.<ref name="DKPodcast25">{{cite AV media |url=http://www.deankoontz.com/podcast-episode-25-book-of-counted-sorrows-1 |title=Podcast Episode 25: Book of Counted Sorrows 1 |people=[[Dean Koontz|Koontz, Dean]] |medium=Podcast |access-date=July 9, 2011}}</ref>
