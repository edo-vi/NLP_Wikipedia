'''Brachygnathism''', or colloquially '''parrot mouth''', is the uneven alignment of the upper and lower [[horse teeth|teeth]] in animals. In serious cases, the upper teeth protrude beyond the lower teeth. Problem with parrot mouth occur if the [[molars]] at the back of the mouth are also uneven, resulting in large hooks forming on the upper molars and the rear of the lower back molars. Horses with parrot mouth often require dental treatment at least every six months to remove the hooks and maintain alignment.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=DeBowes |first1=Richard M. |last2=Gaughan |first2=Earl M. |date=1998-08-01 |title=Congenital Dental Disease of Horses |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0749073917301980 |journal=Veterinary Clinics of North America: Equine Practice |series=Dentistry |language=en |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=273â€“289 |doi=10.1016/S0749-0739(17)30198-0 |pmid=9742664 |issn=0749-0739}}</ref>

The equivalent conditions in humans are termed [[retrognathism]] or [[prognathism]] depending on whether the lower jaw is too far back or too far forward respectively.
