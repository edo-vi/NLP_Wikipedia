Since the 1960s, the issue of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] and [[First Nations in Canada|First Nations]] names and images being used by sports teams as [[mascot]]s has been the subject of increasing public controversy in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]]. This has been a period of rising [[Native American civil rights|Indigenous civil rights movements]], and Native Americans and their supporters object to the use of images and names in a manner and context they consider derogatory. They have conducted numerous protests and tried to educate the public on this issue.

In response since the 1970s, an increasing number of secondary schools have retired such Native American names and mascots. Changes accelerated in 2020, following public awareness of [[institutional racism]] prompted by nationally covered cases of [[police misconduct]]. National attention was focused on the prominent use of names and images by professional franchises including the [[Washington Commanders]] ([[Redskin]]s until July 2020)<ref>{{cite news|last1=Kilgore|first1=Adam|last2=Stubbs|first2=Roman|title=To Native American Groups, Redskins Name Is 'Worst Offender.'

In Canada, the Edmonton Eskimos became the [[Edmonton Elks]] in 2021. Each such change at the professional level has been followed by changes of school teams; for instance, 29 changed their names between August and December 2020. A [[National Congress of American Indians]] (NCAI) database tracks some 1,900 [[K-12]] schools in 970 school districts with Native “themed” school mascots.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ncai.org/NCAI_School_Mascot_Tracking_Database_-_Overview_and_Numbers.pdf | title=National School Mascot Tracking Database - Overview| website=NCAI| access-date=November 30, 2022}}</ref>

The issue has often been reported in the media only in terms of Native American individuals being affected by the offensiveness of certain terms, images, and performances. This reduces the problem to one of feelings and personal opinions. It prevents a more comprehensive understanding of the history and context of the use of Native American names and images, and the reasons why sports teams should eliminate such practices.<ref name="King.2010">{{cite book| chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GApQrXWeGLwC| editor=C.

The NCAI and over 1,500 national Native organizations and advocates have called for a ban on all Native imagery, names, and other appropriation of Native culture in sports. The joint letter included over 100 Native-led organizations, as well as tribal leaders and members of over 150 federally recognized tribes, reflecting their consensus that Native mascots are harmful.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.colorado.edu/program/fpw/2020/07/06/native-leaders-and-investors-respond-washington-dc-football-team-name-review| title= Native Leaders and Investors Respond to Washington D.C.

==History==
[[European American]]s have had a history of "playing Indian" that dates back to the [[Colonial history of the United States|colonial period]]. In the 19th century, fraternal organizations such as the [[Tammanies|Tammany Societies]] and the [[Improved Order of Red Men]] adopted the words and material culture of Native Americans in part to establish an aboriginal identity, while ignoring the dispossession and conquest of Indigenous peoples.<ref>{{cite book| last=Deloria| first=Philip J.| year=1998| title=Playing Indian| location=New Haven| publisher=Yale University Press| title-link=Playing Indian}}</ref><ref>{{cite book| url=http://yalebooks.com/book/9780300080674/playing-indian| title=Playing Indian| publisher=Yale University Press| access-date=January 6, 2016| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630090119/http://yalebooks.com/book/9780300080674/playing-indian| archive-date=June 30, 2016}}</ref> This practice spread to youth groups, such as the [[Boy Scouts of America]] (BSA) (in particular, the [[Order of the Arrow]]) and many summer camps.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.voanews.com/usa/native-americans-boy-scouts-stop-plundering-our-past| title=Native Americans to Boy Scouts: Stop Plundering Our Past| website=Voice of America| author=Cecily Hilleary| date=August 5, 2019| access-date=August 7, 2019}}</ref> University students in the late 19th and early 20th centuries adopted Indian names and symbols for their sports teams, as traditional Native American life was imagined by European Americans.<ref name="Spindel">{{cite book|last=Spindel|first=Carol|year=2002|title=Dancing at Halftime: Sports and the Controversy Over American Indian Mascots|location=New York|publisher=New York University Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4p62ket04PgC|isbn=9780814781272}}</ref>

Professional team names had similar origins. In professional baseball the team that is now the [[Atlanta Braves]] was founded as the Boston Red Stockings in 1871; becoming the [[History of the Boston Braves|Boston Braves]] in 1912. Their owner, [[James E. Gaffney|James Gaffney]], was a member of New York City's political machine, [[Tammany Hall]]. It was nominally formed to honor [[Tamanend]], a chief of the [[Lenape]], then known as the Delaware. The team that moved to become the [[Washington Commanders|Washington Redskins]] in 1937 was originally also known as the Boston Braves; both the [[American football|football]] and baseball teams played at [[Braves Field]]. After moving to [[Fenway Park]], home of the [[Boston Red Sox]], the team name was changed to the Boston Redskins in 1933, using a "red" identifier while retaining the Braves "Indian Head" logo. While defenders of the Redskins sometimes say the name honored coach [[William Henry Dietz]], who claimed Native American heritage, the use of Native American names and imagery by this [[National Football League|NFL]] team began in 1932 - before Dietz was hired in 1933.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsecyclopedia.com/nfl/wasbos/bosskins.html|title=The Boston Redskins|access-date=2013-04-24| website=Sports Ecyclopedia}}</ref>

The [[Cleveland Guardians|Cleveland Indians]]' name originated from a request by club owner [[Charles Somers]] to baseball writers to choose a new name to replace the "Naps", following the departure of their star player [[Nap Lajoie]] after the 1914 season.<ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Baseball writers select "Indians" as the best name to apply to the former Naps |newspaper=The Plain Dealer |location=Cleveland, Ohio |date=January 17, 1915 |quote=With the going of Nap Lajoie to the Athletics, a new name had to be selected for the Cleveland American league club.

It was a nickname previously applied to the old [[Cleveland Spiders]] baseball club during the time when [[Louis Sockalexis]], a member of the [[Penobscot]] tribe of Maine, played for Cleveland.<ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Looking Backwards |newspaper=The Plain Dealer |location=Cleveland, Ohio |date=January 18, 1915}}</ref> The success of the Boston Braves in the [[1914 World Series]] may have been another reason for adopting an Indian mascot.

The stereotyping of Native Americans must be understood in the context of history which includes conquest, forced relocation, and organized efforts to eradicate native cultures. The government-sponsored [[Native American boarding schools|boarding schools]] of the late 19th and early 20th centuries separated young Native Americans from their families in an effort to assimilate them to the mainstream and educate them as European Americans.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/pi/oema/resources/policy/mascots-justif.pdf|title=APA Resolution Justifications|year=2005|website=American Psychological Association|access-date=2013-01-21}}</ref> As stated in an editorial by Carter Meland ([[Anishinaabe]]) and [[David E. Wilkins]] ([[Lumbee]]), both professors of [[Native American studies|American Indian Studies]] at the [[University of Minnesota]]: 
<blockquote>Since the first Europeans made landfall in North America, native peoples have suffered under a weltering array of stereotypes, misconceptions and caricatures. Whether portrayed as ''[[noble savage]]s'', ''[[Stereotypes about indigenous peoples of North America|ignoble savages]]'', ''[[Keep America Beautiful|teary-eyed environmentalists]]'' or, most recently, simply as ''casino-rich'', native peoples find their efforts to be treated with a measure of respect and integrity undermined by images that flatten complex tribal, historical and personal experience into one-dimensional representations that tells us more about the depicters than about the depicted.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The Star Tribune|title=Stereotypes in sports, chaos in federal policy|author1=Carter Meland |author2=David E.

Native mascots are part of the larger issues of [[cultural appropriation]] and the violation of [[indigenous intellectual property]] rights. This encompasses all instances when non-natives use indigenous music, art, costumes, etc. in entertainment and commerce. Scholars contend that harm to Native Americans occurs because the appropriation of Native culture by the majority society continues the systems of dominance and subordination that have been used to colonize, assimilate, and oppress Indigenous groups.<ref>{{cite journal| last=Riley| first=Angela| title=Straight Stealing: Towards an Indigenous System of Cultural Property Protection| journal=Washington Law Review| volume=80| issue=69| date=2005| ssrn=703283}}</ref> The use of caricatures of Native Americans as sports mascots has been characterized as contributing to the [[Social exclusion|marginalization]] of the people in the larger culture. While consultation with other minorities on major projects has improved, decisions affecting Native Americans, such as building the [[Dakota Access Pipeline]], have been made while excluding Native concerns.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/beyond-standing-rock-the-native-american-economic_us_58b6e21de4b0e5fdf619792b| author=Dedrick Asante-Muhammad| title=Beyond Standing Rock: The Native American Economic Experience| quote=The U.S. has gained far too much from the marginalization of Native Americans| date=March 1, 2017| website=The Huffington Post}}</ref>

Issues related to misunderstanding of Native American legal status have also arisen in cases of foster care or adoption of Native American children. Among these is what is known as the [[Adoptive Couple v. Baby Girl|Baby Veronica case]], in which a child was adopted by a white family without the consent of her father, an enrolled member of the [[Cherokee Nation]].<ref>{{cite podcast| url=https://www.thenation.com/article/the-washington-redhawks-culture-jam/| title=The Washington Redhawks Culture Jam: Jacqueline Keeler joins the show to talk native mascotry| host=Dave Zirin| publisher=The Nation| access-date=December 20, 2017| date=December 19, 2017| archive-date=December 22, 2017| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171222054315/https://www.thenation.com/article/the-washington-redhawks-culture-jam/| url-status=dead}}</ref> Federal legislation has been passed to strengthen the priority of tribes in determining the care of their children, as often extended family take over care when needed.

Not all Native Americans totally oppose mascots. Steven Denson ([[Chickasaw]]), a professor at [[Southern Methodist University]], has said that there are acceptable ways to use Native American mascots if it is done in a respectful and tasteful manner. He says: 
<blockquote>I believe it is acceptable if used in a way that fosters understanding and increased positive awareness of the Native-American culture. And it must also be done with the support of the Native-American community. There is a way to achieve a partnership that works together to achieve mutually beneficial goals.<ref name="SMU">{{cite web| url=http://www.redorbit.com/news/science/153383/nativeamerican_nicknamesmascots/index.html| title=Native-American Nicknames/Mascots|website=Red Orbit| date=June 2, 2005}}</ref></blockquote>

The NCAI has recognized the right of individual tribes to establish relationships with teams that allow the latter to retain tribal names.<ref name="NCAI">{{cite web|url=http://www.ncai.org/policy-issues/community-and-culture/anti-defamation-mascots|title=Anti-Defamation and Mascots|website=National Congress of American Indians|access-date=12 January 2013}}</ref> For instance, the [[Spokane Indians]], a minor league baseball team, has established a relationship with the [[Spokane tribe]]. It has abandoned Native American imagery that it had used when the team was founded in 1903. The logo is an "S" and includes a feather; "Spokane" is written on the team jerseys in [[Salish-Spokane-Kalispel language|Salish]], the Spokane language; this is also used for bilingual signs in the ballpark. The mascot is a person dressed as a trout, in reference to the tribe's tradition of fishing. Opponents of Native mascots are divided on this approach. [[Suzan Shown Harjo]] says that there is no such thing as a positive stereotype; while [[Stephanie Fryberg]] responds that even if the team's use of the name may be respectful, opposing fans may use racist gestures and references.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/03/sports/baseball/indians-team-names-mascots.html| title=Why One Team Named the Indians Won't Be Changing Their Name| author=David Waldstein| date=August 3, 2020| newspaper=The New York Times}}</ref>

===Social sciences and education===

A consensus on the damage caused by the use of Native American mascots was stated by the Society of Indian Psychologists in 1999:
<blockquote>Stereotypical and historically inaccurate images of Indians, in general, interfere with learning about them by creating, supporting and maintaining oversimplified and inaccurate views of Indigenous peoples and their cultures. When stereotypical representations are taken as factual information, they contribute to the development of cultural biases and prejudices, (clearly a contradiction to the educational mission of the University.) In the same vein, we believe that continuation of the use of Indians as symbols and mascots is incongruous with the philosophy espoused by many Americans as promoting inclusivity and diversity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aiansip.org/uploads/SIP_Indian_Mascot_Position_Statement.pdf| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151031052230/http://aiansip.org/uploads/SIP_Indian_Mascot_Position_Statement.pdf| archive-date=October 31, 2015|title=Indian Mascot Position Statement | website=Society of Indian Psychologists|date=January 27, 1999|access-date=2013-08-19}}</ref></blockquote>

Sports mascots have been cited as an example of [[Microaggression theory|microaggressions]], the everyday insults that members of marginalized minority groups are subject to by other groups in society.<ref>{{cite book |title=Microaggressions and Marginality: Manifestation, Dynamics, and Impact| author=Derald Wing Sue| publisher=John Wiley & Sons| date=2010| page=384| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7WZxpPnnjzkC&pg=PA114 |isbn=9780470627204}}</ref>

In 2005, the [[American Psychological Association]] (APA) issued a resolution "Recommending the Immediate Retirement of American Indian Mascots, Symbols, Images, and Personalities by Schools, Colleges, Universities, Athletic Teams, and Organizations" due to the harm done by creating a hostile environment, the negative effects on the self-esteem of American Indian children, and discrimination that may violate civil rights.

===Civil rights===

The [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP) passed a resolution calling for the end of the use of Native American names, images, and mascots in 1999.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aistm.org/naacp_1999_resolution.htm |title=NAACP 1999 Resolution |access-date=2013-01-29 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121128103322/http://www.aistm.org/naacp_1999_resolution.htm |archive-date=2012-11-28 | website=American Indian Sports Team Mascots}}</ref>

In 2001, the [[United States Commission on Civil Rights|U.S. Commission on Civil Rights]] released an advisory opinion calling for an end to the use of Native American images and team names by non-Native schools. While recognizing the right to freedom of expression, the commission also recognizes those Native Americans and civil rights advocates that maintain these mascots, by promoting stereotypes, may violate anti-discrimination laws. When found in educational institutions, mascots may also create a hostile environment inconsistent with learning to respect diverse cultures, but instead teach that stereotypes that misrepresent a minority group are permissible. Those schools that claim that their sports imagery stimulate interest in Native American culture have not listened to Native groups and civil rights leaders who point out that even purportedly positive stereotypes both present a false portrayal of the past and prevent understanding of contemporary Native people as fellow Americans.<ref name=USCCR>{{cite press release|url=http://www.usccr.gov/press/archives/2001/041601st.htm |title=Statement of the United States Commission on Civil Rights on the use of Native American images and nicknames as sports symbols |access-date=2016-12-10|date=2001}}</ref>

In a report issued in 2012, a [[United Nations]] expert on Human Rights of Indigenous Peoples cited the continued use of Native American references by sports team as a part of the stereotyping that "obscures understanding of the reality of Native Americans today and instead help to keep alive racially discriminatory attitudes."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=14497&LangID=E |title=USA: 'Redskins' Team mascot hurtful reminder of past suffering of Native Americans – UN rights expert |website=United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413145318/http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=14497&LangID=E |archive-date=2014-04-13 }}</ref> Justice Murray Sinclair, the head of Canada's [[Truth and reconciliation commission|Truth and Reconciliation Commission]] said in 2015 "sports teams with offensive names, such as Redskins and cartoonish aboriginal-looking mascots have no place in a country trying to come to grips with racism in its past".<ref>{{cite news| title=Stop using offensive Indigenous mascots in sports, Justice Murray Sinclair says| url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2015/11/15/stop-using-offensive-indigenous-mascots-in-sports-justice-murray-sinclair-says.html| first=Chinta| last=Puxley| newspaper=The Toronto Star| date=November 15, 2015}}</ref>

In testimony at a session of the Nebraska Advisory Committee of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights in December 2020, local Tribal leaders said it's time for the 22 schools statewide to review their use of Native American names, symbols, and images for their mascots. The [[Nebraska School Activities Association]] which oversees interscholastic sports indicated support for ongoing discussion, but that they had no authority to issue statewide mandates regarding mascots. [[University of Nebraska Omaha]] Professor Edouardo Zendejas, a member of the [[Omaha people|Omaha Tribe of Nebraska]], in addition to advocating legislation, sees the need to revise the history curriculum to include accurate information regarding Native Americans which is currently lacking.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://netnebraska.org/article/news/1246091/us-commission-civil-rights-holds-hearings-native-mascots-nebraska-schools| title=U.S. Commission on Civil Rights Holds Hearings On Native Mascots In Nebraska Schools| author=Christina Stella| website=NET News| publisher=Nebraska PBS & NPR| date=December 17, 2020}}</ref>

====Legal remedies====
While all advocates for elimination of Native mascots agree that the practice is morally wrong, many do not find a basis for legal remedy based upon violation of civil rights. Civil rights law in the United States reflect the difference between the experience of racism by [[African American]]s and Native Americans. The effects of slavery continued after emancipation in the form of discrimination that insured a continued source of cheap labor. What European Americans wanted from Native Americans was not labor but land, and many were willing to have native people themselves assimilate. Continued discrimination came to those who refused to do so, but asserted their separate identity and rights of sovereignty. The appropriation of native cultures is therefore seen as discriminatory practice by some but is not understood as such by those that think of assimilation as a positive process. The difference is reflected in the continued popularity of Native Americans as mascots when similar usage of the names and images of any other ethnic group, in particular African Americans, would be unthinkable, and the continued claim that the stereotype of the "noble savage" honors Native Americans.<ref>{{cite journal|volume=56 |journal=UCLA Law Review |page=591 |title=Red: Racism and the American Indian |last=Berger |first=Bethany R. |year=2009 |url=http://www.uclalawreview.org/pdf/56-3-2.pdf | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150423112932/http://www.uclalawreview.org/pdf/56-3-2.pdf |archive-date=2015-04-23 }}</ref>

In February 2013, the [[Michigan Department of Civil Rights]] (MDCR) filed a complaint with the [[United States Department of Education|US Department of Education]]'s [[Office for Civil Rights]] (OCR). MDCR's complaint asserted that new research clearly establishes that use of American Indian imagery negatively impacts student learning, creating an unequal learning environment in violation of Article VI of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]].<ref name=MDCR>{{cite web|title=Michigan Department of Civil Rights: Continued Use of American Indian Mascots Hurts Student Achievement |url=http://www.michigan.gov/mdcr/0,4613,7-138--294605--,00.html |website=State of Michigan |access-date=23 February 2013 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130218160526/http://www.michigan.gov/mdcr/0%2C4613%2C7-138--294605--%2C00.html |archive-date=18 February 2013 }}</ref> In June 2013, the OCR dismissed the case on the basis that the legal standard required not only harm, but the intent to do harm, which was not established.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.freep.com/article/20130603/NEWS06/306030121/indian-mascot-ban-tossed-michigan| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130605075801/http://www.freep.com/article/20130603/NEWS06/306030121/indian-mascot-ban-tossed-michigan| archive-date=June 5, 2013|title=Feds toss Michigan complaint to ban Indian mascots for sports teams|date=June 3, 2013|newspaper=The Detroit Free Press|first=Lori|last=Higgins|access-date=December 8, 2016}}</ref>

A legal claim of discrimination rests upon a group agreeing that a particular term or practice is offensive, thus opponents of mascot change often point to individuals claiming Native American heritage who say they are not offended. This raised the difficulty of [[Native American identity in the United States]], also an evolving controversy.<ref name="Morris.2015"/>

Mainstream opinion reflects the function of identification with a sports team in both individual and group psychology. There are many benefits associated with sports fandom, both private (increased self-esteem) and public (community solidarity). The activity of viewing sporting events provide shared experiences that reinforce personal and group identification with a team. The name, mascot, cheerleaders, and marching band performances reinforce and become associated with these shared experiences.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.athleticinsight.com/Vol5Iss2/FanDevelopment.htm| title=The Social Psychology of the Creation of a Sports Fan Identity: A Theoretical Review of the Literature| author=Beth Jacobson |website=Athletic Insight - The Online Journal of Sports Psychology| date=2003| access-date=January 15, 2017}}</ref> In an open letter published in 2013, Daniel Snyder explicitly invoked these associations with family, friends, and an 81-year tradition as being the most important reasons for keeping the Redskins name.<ref>{{cite news| title=Letter from Washington Redskins owner Dan Snyder to fans| date= October 9, 2013| newspaper=The Washington Post| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/letter-from-washington-redskins-owner-dan-snyder-to-fans/2013/10/09/e7670ba0-30fe-11e3-8627-c5d7de0a046b_story.html| access-date=January 15, 2017}}</ref> When self-esteem becomes bound to the players and the team, there are many beneficial but also some unfortunate consequences, including denial or rationalization of misbehavior.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-psychology-of-why-sports-fans-see-their-teams-as-extensions-of-themselves/2015/01/30/521e0464-a816-11e4-a06b-9df2002b86a0_story.html| title=The psychology of why sports fans see their teams as extensions of themselves| author=Eric Simons | date=January 30, 2015| newspaper=The Washington Post| access-date=December 20, 2016}}</ref> However, for some, the identity being expressed is one of supremacy, with the defense of native mascots being clearly racist.<ref name="Banks.1993"/>

Some individuals who support the use of Native American mascots state that they are meant to be respectful, and to pay homage to Native American people. Many have made the argument that Native American mascots focus on bravery, courage and fighting skills rather than anything derogatory. Karl Swanson, vice-president of the Washington Redskins professional football team in 2003, declared in the magazine ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' that his team's name "symbolizes courage, dignity, and leadership", and that the "Redskins symbolize the greatness and strength of a grand people".<ref name="bar">{{cite journal| last=Emert| first=Phyllis Raybin| year=2003| url=http://www.njsbf.org/images/content/1/1/11134/Respect%20Winter%202003.pdf| title=Native American Mascots: Racial Slur or Cherished Tradition?| journal=Respect (Newsletter)| publisher=New Jersey State Bar Foundation| volume=2| issue=2 (Winter 2003)|  archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110103052217/http://www.njsbf.org/images/content/1/1/11134/Respect%20Winter%202003.pdf| archive-date=2011-01-03}}</ref>

However, many note that the behavior of fans at games is not respectful. [[Richard Lapchick]], director emeritus of Northeastern University's Center for the Study of Sport in Society, in an article: "Could you imagine people mocking African Americans in [[Blackface|black face]] at a game? Yet go to a game where there is a team with an Indian name and you will see fans with [[Body painting|war paint]] on their faces. Is this not the equivalent to black face?"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=lapchick/050825&num=0|title=Mascots are a matter of respect|website=ESPN|access-date=February 6, 2013}}</ref>

Others claim Native American mascots help promote the culture to those who might be unaware of its significance. [[Chief Illiniwek]], the former mascot for the [[University of Illinois]], became the subject of protest in 1988.<ref name="Spindel"/> In 1990 the Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois called the mascot a dignified symbol: "His ceremonial dance is done with grace and beauty. The Chief keeps the memory of the people of a great Native American tribe alive for thousands of Illinoisans who otherwise would know little or nothing of them."<ref name="Spindel"/> However, the mascot costume was not based on the clothing of the people of the [[Illinois Confederation]], but of the [[Lakota people]], and the first three men to portray Illiniwek were not performing authentic Native American dances, but routines they had learned from other non-Native hobbyists in the [[Boy Scouts of America]].<ref name=Farnell>{{cite journal|last=Farnell|first=Brenda|title=Choreographing Colonialism in the American West|journal=Journal for the Anthropological Study of Human Movement |year=2010|volume=14 |issue=3 |url=https://anthro.illinois.edu/sites/default/files/inline-files/0.pdf | quote=In 1915, the [[Order of the Arrow]], a national Scout camping fraternity, was founded in which ceremonies of initiation were based on 'Indian themes' and local lodges and chapters were  given 'Indian names.' The first three individuals who portrayed Illiniwek (Lester Leutwiler, Webber Borchers, and William Newton) became interested in 'Indian lore' through their involvement with the Boy Scouts. They spent time '[[Playing Indian]]' (Deloria 1998) at summer  camp, learning so-called Indian dances as well as arts and crafts from Ralph Hubbard, a renowned enthusiast who traveled widely in the United States and Europe producing 'Indian pageants'.}}</ref> The [[Peoria people]] are the closest living descendants of the Illiniwek Confederacy. In response to requests by those who had portrayed the mascot to bring back occasional performances, Peoria Chief John P. Froman reaffirmed the tribe's position that Chief (Illiniwek) "was not in any way representative of Peoria culture".<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.news-gazette.com/news/local/2013-05-07/updated-peoria-tribe-leader-doesnt-back-chief-return.html| title=Peoria tribe leader doesn't back Chief return| date=May 7, 2013| author=Christine Des Garennes| newspaper=News-Gazette| access-date=June 9, 2017}}</ref>

Conservative columnists have asserted that outrage over mascots is manufactured by white liberals, rather than being the authentic voice of Native Americans.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nationalinterest.org/commentary/redskins-manufactured-controversy-9395|title=Redskins: A Manufactured Controversy|author=W.

====Other team names and ethnic groups====
Many argue there is a double standard in Native Americans being so frequently used as a sports team name or mascot when the same usage would be unthinkable for other racial or ethnic group. One current exception is the [[Coachella Valley High School]] "Arabs"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/11/07/arab-team-mascot-ethnic-slur/3461059/|title=California high school's Arab mascot draws ire|date=November 7, 2013|access-date=September 17, 2014| newspaper=USA Today}}</ref> which has also been the subject of controversy, resulting in the retirement of its more cartoonish representations.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.desertsun.com/story/news/education/2014/09/09/mighty-arab-coachella-valley-high/15368751/|title='Mighty Arab' takes its place at Coachella Valley High|first=Brett|last=Kelman|newspaper=The Desert Sun|date=September 10, 2014}}</ref>

The [[University of Notre Dame]] [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish|Fighting Irish]]<ref>{{cite web| url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1556389-should-the-notre-dame-fighting-irish-leprechaun-logo-be-banned-by-the-ncaa| title=Should the Notre Dame Fighting Irish Leprechaun Logo Be Banned by the NCAA?| author=Jason S.

However, rather than referring to "others" these teams employ symbols that European American cultures have historically used to represent themselves.<ref>{{cite web|title= Is "Fighting Irish" Offensive?| date=October 9, 2014| author=Cassidy McDonald| url=http://scholastic.nd.edu/issues/is-fighting-irish-offensive/|website=University of Notre Dame Scholastic| access-date=9 June 2017}}</ref> The [[University of Notre Dame]] mascot, the [[Notre Dame Leprechaun|Leprechaun]],<ref name="ND">{{cite web |url=http://und.cstv.com/trads/nd-m-fb-mas.html |title=Notre Dame Fighting Irish - Traditions: The Leprechaun |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071201200717/http://und.cstv.com/trads/nd-m-fb-mas.html |archive-date=December 1, 2007 | website=University of Notre Dame Athletics}}</ref> is a mythical being that represents the [[Irish people|Irish]], which is both an ethnic and a national group.<ref name="fearson">{{cite journal |last=Fearon |first=James |title=Ethnic and Cultural Diversity by Country |journal=Journal of Economic Growth |year=2003|volume=8|issue=2|pages=195–222|url=https://web.stanford.edu/group/fearon-research/cgi-bin/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Ethnic-and-Cultural-Diversity-by-Country.pdf| quote=Ireland has an ethnic fractionalization score of 0.171, meaning that there is only a 17.1% chance that two randomly selected people in Ireland will be from different ethnic groups. |doi=10.1023/A:1024419522867 |s2cid=152680631}}</ref> The [[Cayenne (mascot)|University of Louisiana at Lafayette mascot]] is an anthropomorphic [[Cayenne (mascot)|cayenne pepper]], an ingredient frequently found in [[Cajun cuisine]]. Proponents of change also see a false equivalency in the argument that if one group is not insulted by a particular portrayal, then no group has the right to feel insulted, which only serves to discount what Native American voices are saying. This argument ignores the vastly different backgrounds, treatment, and social positions of the groups; and the effects of [[systemic racism]] that continues to impact Native Americans but no longer white minorities such as the Irish. Also ignored are the cumulative effects of hundreds of Native mascots compared to the rare use of a white ethnic mascot.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thesocietypages.org/socimages/2008/10/05/notre-dames-fighting-irish-mascot|title=Sociological Images| first=Gwen |last=Sharp| date=October 5, 2008| website=The Society Pages| access-date=December 28, 2021}}</ref>

The [[United States Commission on Civil Rights|U.S. Commission on Civil Rights]] call for an end to the use of Native American mascots was only for non-native schools.<ref name=USCCR/> In cases where universities were founded to educate Native Americans, such mascots may not be examples of [[cultural appropriation]] or stereotyping. Examples include the [[Haskell Indian Nations Fighting Indians|Fighting Indians]] of the [[Haskell Indian Nations University]] and the [[University of North Carolina at Pembroke]] (UNCP), which continues to have a substantial number of native students, and close ties to the [[Lumbee]] tribe. The UNCP nickname is the [[UNC Pembroke Braves|Braves]], but the mascot is a [[red-tailed hawk]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uncp.edu/news/2005/braves_nickname.htm|title=NCAA: UNCP will keep the Braves|date=August 9, 2005|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051222114740/http://www.uncp.edu/news/2005/braves_nickname.htm| archive-date=December 22, 2005|access-date=December 8, 2016| website=University of North Carolina at Pembroke}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mcac-naia.org/members.php |title=Member institutions |website=Midlands Collegiate Athletic Conference |access-date=18 March 2015 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150328075846/http://www.mcac-naia.org/members.php |archive-date=28 March 2015 }}

====Financial impact of change====
Many supporters of Native American mascots feel that the financial cost of changing mascots would outweigh the benefits. Sales of merchandise with team mascots and nicknames generate millions of dollars in sales each year, and teams contend that a change in team mascots would render this merchandise useless.<ref name="bar"/> The cost of removing images from uniforms and all other items, which must be paid out of local school funds, is a greater factor for secondary schools.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mailtribune.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20120518/NEWS/205180322|title=State bans Native American mascots|date=May 18, 2012|first=Sanne|last=Specht|newspaper=Mail Tribune|access-date=February 11, 2013}}</ref> Opponents feel that despite the cost of a change in team mascots, it should be done to prevent what they believe is racial stereotyping. [[Clyde Bellecourt]], when director of the [[American Indian Movement]] stated: "It's the behavior that accompanies all of this that's offensive. The rubber [[Tomahawk (axe)|tomahawks]], the chicken [[War bonnet|feather headdresses]], people wearing [[Body painting|war paint]] and making these ridiculous [[Battle cry|war whoops]] with a tomahawk in one hand and a beer in the other; all of these have significant meaning for us. And the psychological impact it has, especially on our youth, is devastating."<ref name="bar"/>

A study done by the [[Emory University]] [[Goizueta Business School]] indicates that the growing unpopularity of Native American mascots is a financial drain for professional teams, losing money compared to more popular animal mascots.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://blogs.emory.edu/sportsmarketing/2013/12/19/the-financial-impact-of-mascots-on-sports-brands/?_ga=1.256951951.500422532.1397069844b|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141020044121/https://scholarblogs.emory.edu/esma/2013/12/19/the-financial-impact-of-mascots-on-sports-brands/?_ga=1.256951951.500422532.1397069844b| archive-date=October 20, 2014| title=The Financial Impact of Mascots on Sports Brands|website=Emory University|date=December 19, 2013|access-date=April 20, 2014}}</ref> Writing for ''[[Forbes]]'' in response to the statewide mascot ban passed by Maine in 2019, marketing analyst Henry DeVries compares Native mascots to the retired "[[Frito Bandito]]" mascot, and argues that "offensive marketing mascots" are a bad idea financially and "on the wrong side of history".<ref>{{cite magazine| url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/henrydevries/2019/06/01/why-maine-banning-indian-mascots-is-a-marketing-wake-up-call/#6ae6986c126d| title=Why Maine Banning Indian Mascots Is A Marketing Wake Up Call| author=Henry DeVries| magazine=Forbes| access-date=June 4, 2019}}</ref>

====Public opinion surveys====
{{see also|Washington Redskins name opinion polls}}
A survey conducted in 2002 by [[Harris Insights & Analytics|The Harris Poll]] for ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' (''SI'') found that 81% of Native Americans who live outside traditional Indian reservations and 53% of Indians on reservations did not find the images discriminatory. The authors of the article concluded that "Although most Native American activists and tribal leaders consider Indian team names and mascots offensive, neither Native Americans in general nor a cross section of U.S. sports fans agree". According to the article, "There is a near total disconnect between Indian activists and the Native American population on this issue." An Indian activist commented on the results saying "that Native Americans' self-esteem has fallen so low that they don't even know when they're being insulted".<ref name=PriceWoo>{{cite magazine| url = https://www.si.com/vault/2002/03/04/8100154/the-indian-wars-the-campaign-against-indian-nicknames-and-mascots-presumes-that-they-offend-native-americansbut-do-they-we-took-a-poll-and-you-wont-believe-the-results| author = S.L. Price| title = The Indian Wars| magazine = Sports Illustrated| date = March 4, 2002| pages=66–71}}</ref> Soon after the ''SI'' article, a group of five social scientists experienced in researching the mascot issue published a journal article arguing against the validity of this survey and its conclusions. First they state that "The confidence with which the magazine asserts that a 'disconnect' between Native American activists and Native Americans exists on this issue belies the serious errors in logic and accuracy made in the simplistic labeling of Native Americans who oppose mascots as 'activists.'"<ref>{{cite journal|title=Of Polls and Race Predudice|doi=10.1177/0193732502238255|journal=Journal of Sport and Social Issues|date=November 2002|volume=26|issue=4|page=381|author1=C.

A flaw unique to polls of Native Americans is they rely upon self-identification to select the target population. In an editorial in the [[The Herald-Times|Bloomington Herald Times]], Steve Russell (an enrolled [[Cherokee]] citizen and associate professor of criminal justice at [[Indiana University]]), states that both SI and Annenberg's samples of "self-identified Native Americans&nbsp;... includes plenty of people who have nothing to do with Indians".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iupui.edu/~mstd/e320/amerind/flap.html|title=Some collected materials about the NCAA's decision to ban Indian sports mascots from the Indianapolis area|access-date=January 27, 2013| website=Indiana University}}</ref> Individuals claiming to be Native American when they are not is well known in academic research, and people claiming Indian identity specifically to gain authority in the debate over sports mascots has been criticised.<ref name="too">{{cite journal|author=Charles Springwood|title='I'm Indian Too!': Claiming Native American Identity, Crafting Authority in Mascot Debates|journal=Journal of Sport and Social Issues|date=February 2004|volume=28|page=56|issue=1|doi=10.1177/0193732503261477|s2cid=145233598}}</ref>

The National Congress of American Indians (NCAI) states that as of 2020 there were 1,916 schools in 1,025 school districts that use such mascots.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Reyes |first1=Lorenzo |title=Maine remains only state to fully ban Native American mascots.

While protests began in the 1970s, national attention to the issue did not occur until widespread television coverage of college and professional games brought the behavior of some fans to the attention of Native Americans. The appearance of the [[Atlanta Braves]] in the [[1991 World Series]] and the Washington Redskins at the 1992 [[Super Bowl XXVI|Super Bowl]] prompted the largest response because the games were played in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]], which has a large Native American population.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://miamioh.edu/about-miami/diversity/miami-tribe-relations/mascot-story/native-mascots/index.html| title=Native Mascots Become a National Controversy | website=Miami University of Ohio| access-date=December 19, 2016}}</ref>

The documents most often cited to justify the elimination of Native mascots are the advisory opinion by the [[United States Commission on Civil Rights]] in 2001 and a resolution by the [[American Psychological Association]] in 2005.<ref name=APA/><ref name=USCCR/> Neither of these documents refer to subjective perceptions of offensiveness, but to scientific evidence of harms and legal definitions of discrimination. However, the issue is often discussed in the media in terms of feelings and opinions, and prevents full understanding of the history and context of the use of Native American names and images and why their use by sports teams should be eliminated.<ref name="King.2010"/>

Individual school districts have responded to complaints by local Native American individuals and tribes, or have made changes due to an increased awareness of the issue among educators and students. New Native mascots have not been proposed in recent decades, or are withdrawn before becoming official due to public opposition. For example, in 2016 when one of the teams in the [[National College Prospects Hockey League]] (NCPHL) was announced as the Lake Erie Warriors with a caricature Mohawk logo<ref>{{cite web |url=http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2016/07/28/social-media-blasts-lake-erie-warriors-over-racist-logo-165302| title=Social Media Blasts Lake Erie Warriors Over Racist Logo| first=Vincent| last=Schilling| date=July 28, 2016| website=Indian Country Today}}</ref> it was immediately changed to the Lake Erie Eagles.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.uni-watch.com/2016/07/30/lake-erie-warriors-renamed-lake-erie-eagles-probably/ |title=Lake Erie Warriors Renamed Lake Erie Eagles (probably)| first=Paul| last=Lukas| date=July 30, 2016| website=Uni-Watch}}</ref> [[Little League International]] updated its 2019 rulebook to include a statement prohibiting "the use of team names, mascots, nicknames or logos that are racially insensitive, derogatory or discriminatory in nature."<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.littleleague.org/playing-rules/rulebook-updates/| title=Rulebook Update| access-date=January 11, 2019| website=Little League International}}</ref> This decision has been applauded by the National Congress of American Indians.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://alaska-native-news.com/ncai-applauds-decision-by-little-league-international-to-ban-racially-offensive-team-names-and-mascots/39551/| title=NCAI Applauds Decision by Little League International to Ban Racially Offensive Team Names and Mascots| date=January 11, 2019| website=Alaska Native News}}</ref> In February, 2019 [[US Lacrosse]] issued a position statement which said in part "As the sport's national governing body, US Lacrosse believes that the misuse of Native American nicknames, logos, and mascots reflect and promote misleading stereotypes that are degrading and harmful to Native Americans.

[[Secondary schools]] in both the United States and Canada have displayed a range of actions, with some voluntarily changing names or images, while others have kept current mascots. A 2013 analysis of a database indicated that more than 2,000 high schools have mascots that referred to Native American culture.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Munguia|first1=Hayley|title=The 2,128 Native American Mascots People Aren't Talking About|url=http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-2128-native-american-mascots-people-arent-talking-about/|website=fivethirtyeight.com|date=September 5, 2014|access-date=6 November 2015}}</ref> Following a period of extended population growth in both countries over 50 years, this compares to around 3,000 schools with such names at the beginning of that period.<ref name="NCAI"/>

====Canada====
The Department of Educational Foundations at the [[University of Saskatchewan]] passed a resolution in 2013 calling for the retirement of all school mascots and logos that depict [[First Nations in Canada|First Nations]] people.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/staff-at-saskatchewan-university-calls-for-end-of-first-nations-logos-mascots-1.1546812|title=Staff at Saskatchewan university calls for end of First Nations logos, mascots|website=CTV News |date=November 16, 2013|access-date=January 14, 2014}}</ref>

In addition to changing their sports mascots, school boards in Ontario in 2016 were considering a ban on students wearing any articles bearing offensive names or logos, whether related to professional or local teams.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.thestar.com/yourtoronto/education/2016/02/24/school-boards-onside-with-move-to-ban-racist-logos.html| title=School boards onside with move to ban 'racist logos'| first=Kristin| last=Rushowy| date=February 24, 2016| newspaper=The Toronto Star}}</ref>

Since the early 21st century, the Nepean Redskins Football Club, a minor league youth team operating for 35 years in [[Ottawa]], Ontario, had been asked to change its name.<ref name="cbcNews">{{cite web|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/redskins-name-scrapped-by-ottawa-minor-football-club-1.2493697| title=Redskins name scrapped by Ottawa minor football club|last=staff|publisher=CBC News|date= 13 Jan 2014}}</ref> In 2013 [[A Tribe Called Red|Ian Campeau]] ([[Ojibway]]), a musician and activist in Ottawa, filed a human rights complaint against the team on behalf of his five-year-old daughter.

That's as offensive as using the [[Nigger#The N-word euphemism|n-word]]."

====United States====
The [[Oregon State Board of Education]] voted in 2012 to ban Oregon public schools from using Native Americans as mascots. An exception was made in 2014 to allow schools to keep their mascots if a local federally-recognized tribe agreed. Schools using a "Warriors" mascot were allowed to keep the name if any Native American imagery was changed. Changes made following the policy include [[The Dalles High School]] Eagle Indians changing to the "Riverhawks", the [[Reedsport Community Charter School]] Braves to the singular "Brave" (as an adjective), and the [[Mohawk High School (Marcola, Oregon)|Mohawk High School]] Indians to the "Mustangs".<ref>{{Cite web |title=State Board of Education Bans Use of Native American Mascots |url=https://www.oregon.gov/ode/about-us/stateboard/Pages/State-Board-of-Education-Bans-Use-of-Native-American-Mascots.aspx |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220925214659/https://www.oregon.gov/ode/about-us/stateboard/Pages/State-Board-of-Education-Bans-Use-of-Native-American-Mascots.aspx |archive-date=September 25, 2022 |access-date=September 25, 2022 |website=Oregon State Board of Education}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=March 8, 2012 |title=Appendix C: Native American Mascots in Oregon |url=https://www.oregon.gov/ode/about-us/stateboard/Documents/native-american-mascot-list-of-schools.pdf |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220705144954/https://www.oregon.gov/ode/about-us/stateboard/Documents/native-american-mascot-list-of-schools.pdf |archive-date=July 5, 2022 |access-date=September 25, 2022 |website=Oregon State Board of Education}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Arnold |first=Jake |date=June 22, 2017 |title=Four school districts win approval of Native American mascots |work=Oregon School Boards Association |url=https://www.osba.org/News-Center/Announcements/2017-06-22_Mascots.aspx |access-date=September 25, 2022}}</ref>

In January 2020 the school board of [[Killingly High School]] in [[Killingly, Connecticut|Connecticut]], had a Republican majority.

This issue was dealt with differently in Maine, where there was also support for changing such offensive names. In [[Skowhegan, Maine]], where the area high school sports team was named the "Indians", the [[Penobscot]] Nation and the [[American Civil Liberties Union|ACLU]] of [[Maine]] urged that it be changed. In March 2019 the local School Board voted to eliminate the mascot at Skowhegan Area High School.

Due to media coverage of the controversy over the prominent Washington Redskins, high schools with the sports teams named Redskins have received particular attention across the country. Three have a majority of Native American students. Advocates for the name suggest that, because some Native Americans use the name to refer to themselves, it is not insulting.<ref name=Spoken>{{cite web|first=Rick |last=Reilly |title=Have the people spoken? |url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/9689220/redskins-name-change-not-easy-sounds/ |website=ESPN |access-date=October 15, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130919035546/http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/9689220/redskins-name-change-not-easy-sounds |archive-date=September 19, 2013 | date=September 18, 2013 }}</ref> But, the principal of [[Red Mesa High School]], a Native American-majority school in [[Teec Nos Pos, Arizona]], said that use of the word outside American Indian communities should be avoided because it could perpetuate "the legacy of negativity that the term has created."<ref name="Michelle Peirano">{{cite web|url=http://cronkitenewsonline.com/2013/05/in-debate-over-redskins-name-is-the-r-word-for-racism-or-respect/|title=In debate over Redskins name, is the 'R-word' for racism or respect?|date=May 1, 2013|first=Michelle|last=Peirano|website=Cronkite News|access-date=2014-02-06}}</ref>

In 2001, the commissioner of the New York State Education Department sent a letter to all New York school boards calling for the elimination of Native American mascots. The Seneca Nation Tribal Council responded with support for the Warrior imagery in the Salamanca school. Other members of the community also wanted to retain it. Some 26% of the Salamanca Central High School students are Native American (primarily Seneca), and its sports teams were called the "Warriors". Since the late 20th century, keeping the Warrior sports identity has resulted in negotiations in Salamanca between the Seneca and non-Seneca populations and actions that have raised general awareness of true Seneca culture. For example, the school logo was changed to accurately depict a Seneca man; this replaced a stereotypical [[Plains Indian]] warrior image that had been used prior to 1978.<ref>{{cite journal| last=Taylor| first=Michael| title=THE SALAMANCA WARRIORS: A Case Study of an 'Exception to the Rule.'| journal=Journal of Anthropological Research| volume=67| issue=2| year=2011| pages=245–265| jstor=41303285| doi=10.3998/jar.0521004.0067.205| s2cid=147397834}}</ref>

The [[Port Neches–Groves High School]] "Indian" mascot has garnered controversy for being racist and culturally insensitive.

[[File:Ticket Washington vs Stanford 1930 side1.jpg|right|thumb|250px|1930 football ticket stub depicting the former Stanford Indian mascot]]
Some college teams voluntarily changed their names and mascots. [[Stanford University]] had "The Stanford Indian" as its mascot from 1930 to 1972. Today Stanford's athletic team identity is built around the "[[Stanford Cardinal]]", reflecting the primary [[school colors|school color]] that has been used from the earliest days, while the unofficial mascot shown on its primary logo is the [[Stanford Tree]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Color: Stanford Identity Toolkit|url=http://identity.stanford.edu/color.html|access-date=7 October 2017| website=Stanford University}}</ref> Another early change was the "[[Saltine Warrior#Mascot|Saltine Warrior]]" that represented [[Syracuse University]] from 1931 until 1978. After a brief attempt to use a Roman warrior, the mascot became [[Otto the Orange]] for the school color. [[Miami University]] began discussion regarding the propriety of the Redskins name and images in 1972, and changed its team nickname to [[Miami RedHawks|RedHawks]] in 1996.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.miami.muohio.edu/about-miami/diversity/miami-tribe-relations/mascot-story/index.html|title=Mascot Story|access-date=February 5, 2013|website=Miami University}}</ref>

Although [[Dartmouth College]] had not used an Indian mascot for many years, [[Yale University]] printed a program for the 2016 game commemorating its 100th game against Dartmouth showing historical program covers featuring depictions of Native Americans that some imagine to be racist.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2016/10/10/football-programs-criticized-for-racist-imagery/| title=Football programs criticized for racist imagery| first=Manasa| last=Rao| date=October 10, 2016| newspaper=Yale Daily News}}</ref>

The [[Florida State Seminoles]] of [[Florida State University]] use names and images associated with the [[Seminole]] people.

====National Collegiate Athletic Association====
{{main|NCAA Native American mascot decision}}
The [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) distributed a "self evaluation" to 31 colleges in 2005, for teams to examine the use of potentially offensive imagery with their mascot choice. Nineteen teams were cited as having potentially "hostile or abusive" names, mascots, or images, that would be banned from displaying them during post-season play, and prohibited from hosting tournaments.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.ncaa.org/static/champion/where-pride-meets-prejudice/index.php| title=Where Pride Meets Prejudice| first=Amy| last=Schwarb| website=National Collegiate Athletic Association| access-date=December 9, 2016}}</ref> Subsequently, all of the colleges previously using Native American imagery changed except for those granted waivers when they obtained official support from individual tribes based upon the principle of [[Tribal sovereignty in the United States|tribal sovereignty]].<ref name="NCAI"/>

The continued performance of the tomahawk chop and war chant by Braves fans was made highly visible nationally by the team's appearance in the [[2021 World Series]]. The Braves were defended by MLB Commissioner Manfred, who referred to the support of the team by Richard Sneed, principal chief of the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians. Other Native American leaders around the country continue to describe "the Chop" and its associated fan behavior as deeply insulting while avoiding direct criticism of Sneed. Psychologist Stephanie Fryberg believes personal opinions have little to do with the potential detrimental effects of mascots to Native American youth and communities.<ref>{{Cite news| issn = 0190-8286| last1 = Kilgore| first1 = Adam| last2 = Janes| first2 = Chelsea| title = The 'tomahawk chop' lives on in Atlanta.

{{main|Chicago Blackhawks name and logo controversy}}
[[File:Brandon Saad - Chicago Blackhawks.jpg|thumb|left|Blackhawks jersey worn by [[Brandon Saad]] (2014)]]

Native American rights advocate [[Suzan Shown Harjo]] ([[Cheyenne]] and [[Muscogee]]) said in 2013 that the [[Chicago Blackhawks]] have escaped the scrutiny given to other teams using Native imagery because [[Ice hockey|hockey]] is not a cultural force on the level of [[American football|football]]. But she says national American Indian organizations have called for an end to all Indian-related mascots and that she found the hockey team's name and Indian head symbol to be offensive. "It lacks dignity," she said. "There's dignity in a school being named after a person or a people. There's dignity in a health clinic or hospital. There's nothing dignified in something being so named (that is used for) recreation or entertainment or fun." The National Congress of American Indians also opposes the Blackhawks' logo, as it does all Native American mascots.<ref name=Keilman.2013>{{cite news| url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-06-19/news/ct-met-indian-mascots-20130619_1_american-indians-black-hawk-mascots| title=Protests rare over Blackhawks' name, logo: While critics say use of Indian mascots perpetuates outdated image, hockey club says it has mutually beneficial ties with local community| date=June 19, 2013| first=John| last=Keilman| newspaper=Chicago Tribune}}</ref> 

The team's name originates from the nickname applied to the [[United States Army]]'s [[86th Infantry Division (United States)|86th Infantry Division]], the "Black Hawks"; the nickname originated from prominent [[Sauk people|Sauk]] chief [[Black Hawk (Sauk leader)|Black Hawk]], who fought against the United States during the [[Black Hawk War]].

In 2019, the [[American Indian Center]] of Chicago ended all ties to the Chicago Blackhawks Foundation, stating they will no longer affiliate "with organizations that perpetuate stereotypes through the use of 'Indian' mascots." The AIC said that they "previously held a relationship with the Chicago Blackhawks Foundation with the intention of educating the general public about American Indians and the use of logos and mascots. The AIC, along with members of the community have since decided to end this relationship" and stated that "going forward, AIC will have no professional ties with the Blackhawks, or any other organization that perpetuates harmful stereotypes."<ref>{{cite web| url=https://aicchicago.org/statement-aic-ends-ties-with-chicago-blackhawks-foundation/| title=Statement: AIC ends ties with Chicago Blackhawks Foundation| date=July 8, 2019| website=American Indian Center - Chicago| access-date=July 6, 2020| archive-date=July 16, 2020| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200716033424/https://aicchicago.org/statement-aic-ends-ties-with-chicago-blackhawks-foundation/| url-status=dead}}</ref>

In 1963 the [[Kansas City Chiefs]] adopted their name when the Dallas Texans (AFL) relocated. "Chiefs" was not a direct reference to Native Americans, but to the nickname of Kansas City mayor [[Harold Roe Bartle]], who was instrumental in bringing the Texans to [[Kansas City, Missouri]].

==Other issues==

===Stereotyping by rival fans===
In addition to the behavior displayed by some fans of the teams with Native American names or mascots, their rival fans often invoke racist stereotypes. In December of 2013, when the Washington Redskins played the [[Kansas City Chiefs]], an employee of a [[Sonic Drive-In]] in Missouri placed a message outside that used [[scalping]], [[Indian reservation|reservations]] and [[Whisky|whiskey]] to disparage the "Redskins". It was quickly removed with the owner's apologies.<ref>{{cite magazine| url=https://www.washingtonian.com/2013/12/09/sonic-drive-in-apologizes-for-incredibly-racist-redskins-sign/| title=Sonic Drive-In Apologizes for Incredibly Racist "Redskins" Sign: A roadside sign even more awful than the team's on-field performance| author=Benjamin Freed| date=December 9, 2013| magazine=Washingtonian| access-date=June 7, 2020}}</ref> A rubber severed "Indian" head impaled on a knife has been used by a sports fan in [[Philadelphia]] to taunt rival teams with Native American mascots.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nativeappropriations.com/2010/06/thanks-for-the-severed-head-youve-proved-my-point.html|author=Adrienne J.

===Varying degrees of offensiveness===
To further complicate this controversy, many feel that there are varying levels of offensiveness with team names and mascots. The nature and degree of stereotyping varies depending on the name of the team, the logo, the mascot, and the behavior of fans. The greatest offense is taken when the logo and mascot are caricatures viewed as insulting, such as the [[Cleveland Indians]]' [[Chief Wahoo]];<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicculture.org/news/features/index.cfm?recnum=5437|title=Coalition Of Religious Investors Fight Baseball Team Logo|date=July 10, 1997|access-date=January 18, 2013|website=Catholic Culture}}</ref> the name of the team is often regarded as a racial slur, such as Redskins or [[Squaw]]s,<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.dodgecountynews.com/archives/7311-Squaws-are-region-runner-upshost-first-round-of-state-Friday.html| title=Squaws are region runner-ups:host first round of state Friday| date=February 15, 2017 | access-date=March 6, 2017| website=The Dodge County News Online}}</ref> or the behavior of the mascot or fans is based upon popular images of Indians which trivialize authentic native cultures, such as the tomahawk chop.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.sbnation.com/mlb/2013/5/1/4292152/yeah-the-tomahawk-chop-bugs-me-heres-why| title=Yeah, the "Tomahawk Chop" bugs me. Here's why| first=Mike| last=Bates| date=May 1, 2013| website=SB Nation}}</ref>

The practices of individual schools and teams have changed in response to the controversy. A local example is [[Washington High School (Sioux Falls, South Dakota)|Washington High School]] in [[Sioux Falls, South Dakota]]. Many Native American images have been removed, and the "Warriors" nickname is now claimed to be generic. The school now has a "circle of courage" logo with eagle feathers and has also "updated" the murals of Chief [[Hollow Horn Bear]] in the gym. Duane Hollow Horn Bear, the chief's great-grandson, who teaches Lakota language and history at [[Sinte Gleska University]] in [[Mission, South Dakota|Mission]], stated: "We had no objection to their utilizing those pictures as long as my great-grandfather was represented with honor and dignity." However, not all Native Americans are happy with the presence of any such images.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.argusleader.com/story/opinion/columnists/stu-whitney/2015/01/17/whitney-sioux-falls-team-indian-nickname/21925163/| title=Does Washington High have nickname problem?| first=Stu| last=Whitney| date=January 17, 2015| website=Argus Leader}}</ref>

===Teams outside North America===
{{further|List of sports team names and mascots derived from indigenous peoples|l1=Native American mascots of teams outside the US and Canada}}
Native American names and images are used by teams in other countries, generally those playing American-style sports and copying the imagery of American teams. Several are in countries that also have a tradition of [[Native American hobbyism in Germany|Native American hobbyists]] often associated with the popularity of the stories written by German author [[Karl May]].<ref name="NYTimes.2018.05.07">{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/07/sports/native-american-mascots-europe.html| title=Tomahawk Chops and Indian Mascots: In Europe, Teams Don't See a Problem| author=Andrew Keh| newspaper=The New York Times| date=May 7, 2018}}</ref> In South America there are a number of teams that reference the [[Guaraní people]]. In Brazil, these teams may be referred to using the derogatory term ''bugre''.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://edition.cnn.com/2021/01/18/sport/indigenous-culture-in-global-sport-cmd-spt-intl/index.html| title=Global sport's problem with the appropriation of Indigenous culture| author=Calum Trenaman| website=CNN.com| date=January 18, 2021}}</ref>
