'''Tokogeny''' or '''tocogeny''' is the biological relationship between parent and offspring, or more generally between ancestors and descendants.  In contradistinction to [[phylogeny]] it applies to individual [[organism]]s as opposed to [[species]].

In the tokogentic system shared characteristics are called ''traits''.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Species Concepts and Phylogenetic Theory: A Debate|others=Editors: Quentin Wheeler, Rudolf Meier|publisher=Columbia University Press, 2000|chapter=5: The Phylogenetic Concept (''[[sensu]]'' Wheeler and Platnick)|author=Quentin R.
