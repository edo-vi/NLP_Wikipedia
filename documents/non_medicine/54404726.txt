D. has highlighted the concept of polyherbalism in this ancient medicinal system. In the traditional system of Indian medicine, plant formulations and combined extracts of plants are chosen rather than individual ones. It is known that Ayurvedic herbals are prepared in a number of dosage forms, in which mostly all of them are PHF. Due to synergism, polyherbalism confers some benefits which is not available in single herbal formulation.
