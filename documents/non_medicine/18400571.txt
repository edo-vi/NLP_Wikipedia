==Examples==
[[File:Homosexualitywilde.jpg|thumb|Oscar Wilde (right) and Lord Alfred Douglas]]
The playwright [[Oscar Wilde]] has been described as a "poseur".<ref>Ellis, Havelock, Mrs. "A Note on Oscar Wilde". ''The Lotus Magazine''. Vol. 9, No. 4 (Jan., 1918), pp. 191-194. "When people say that Wilde was only a poser what do they mean?  They forget that his 'poses' were his reality."</ref> [[Thomas Hardy]] said of him, "His early reputation as a poseur and [[fop]] – so necessary to his notoriety – recoiled upon the scholar and gentleman (as Wilde always innately was), and even upon the artist".<ref name="Hardy, Thomas 2016. page 256"/>

[[Lord Alfred Douglas]] said of Wilde, "That he had what passed for genius nobody will, I think, nowadays dispute, though it used to be the fashion to [[pooh-pooh]] him for a mere poseur and decadent."<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/oscarwildemyself00dougrich/oscarwildemyself00dougrich_djvu.txt Douglas, Lord Alfred.  ''Oscar Wilde and Myself.''] Duffield & Company. New York. (1914) Introduction. page 3.</ref>

The painter [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler|James A. Whistler]] has been sometimes described as a "poseur" for his manner and personal style.<ref>Spielmann, Marion Harry. editor. "James A. McNeil Whistler, 1834—1903; Personal Recollections" ''The Magazine of Art'', Volume 1.

''Thirteen Years of a Busy Woman's Life''.] Chapter XV. Publisher: John Lane (1912). page 168 - 175.</ref> It has been suggested that Whistler's genius lay partly in his ability to cultivate the role of the poseur, to "act as if he were always on stage", in order to stir interest, and cause people to wonder how such a poseur could create work that was so serious and authentic. His fame as an artist seemed to require that he present himself as a poseur.<ref>Burns, Sarah. ''Inventing the Modern Artist: Art and Culture in Gilded Age America''. Yale University Press (1996) {{ISBN|9780300078596}}. p 236</ref>

The playwright and critic, [[George Bernard Shaw]], has been described as a poseur; in that context Shaw is quoted as saying, "I have never pretended that G.B.S. was real ... The whole point of the creature is that he is unique, fantastic, unrepresentative, inimitable, impossible, undesirable on any large scale, utterly unlike anybody that ever existed before, hopelessly unnatural, and void of real passion."<ref>Henderson, Archibald. ''George Bernard Shaw His Life and Works''. Stewardt & Kidd Co. (1911). p 498</ref>

In the ancient Greek comedy ''[[The Clouds]]'', the playwright [[Aristophanes]] portrays [[Socrates]] as a "poseur".<ref>Silk, M.S. ''Aristophanes and the Definition of Comedy.'' Oxford University Press (2002) {{ISBN|9780199253821}}. p 172.</ref>

==Etymology==
The English term "poseur" is a [[loanword]] from French. The word in English use dates back to the mid 19th Century. It is from the French word ''poseur'', and from the Old French word ''poser'', meaning "to put, place, or set". The ''Online Etymology Dictionary'', suggests that "poseur" is in fact the English word "poser" dressed "in French garb, and thus could itself be considered an affectation."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=poseur&searchmode=none |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Etymonline.com |access-date=7 February 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010024654/http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=poseur&searchmode=none |archive-date=10 October 2012}}</ref>

== Use within contemporary subcultures ==
"Poseur" is often a pejorative term, as used in the [[Punk subculture|punk]], [[Heavy metal subculture|heavy metal]], [[hip hop]], and [[goth subculture|goth]] [[subculture]]s, or the [[skateboarding]], [[surfing]] and [[jazz]] communities, when it is used to refer to a person who copies the dress, speech, and/or mannerisms of a group or subculture, generally for attaining acceptability within the group or for popularity among various other groups, yet who is deemed not to share or understand the values or philosophy of the subculture.

The term ''poseur'' was used in several late-1970s punk songs, including the [[X-Ray Spex]] song "I Am a Poseur", which included the lyrics "I am a poseur and I don't care/I like to make people stare/Exhibition is the name."
Another song using the term was the [[Television Personalities]] song "Part-Time Punks". The Television Personalities' song "was a reaction to the macho posturing of the English punk scene".<ref>{{cite web|last=Leung |first=Godfre |title=Towards a Post-Gendered Pop Music: Television Personalities' My Dark Places |url=http://www.indiecult.com/2006-04/television-personalities-my-dark-places |publisher=Independent Culture |access-date=30 July 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060717220604/http://www.indiecult.com/2006-04/television-personalities-my-dark-places |archive-date=17 July 2006 }}</ref> The lyrics argue that, "while Television Personalities were not themselves punks in the orthodox sense, neither was anyone else". The song "declared that either everyone who wanted to be a punk was one or that everyone was a poseur (or both)", and it argues that "the concept of [...] punk rock authenticity, of [[Joe Strummer]], was a fiction".

An article in ''Drowned in Sound'' argues that 1980s-era "[[hardcore punk|hardcore]] is the true spirit of punk" because "[a]fter all the poseurs and fashionistas fucked off to the next trend of skinny pink ties with [[New Romantic]] haircuts, singing wimpy lyrics". It argued that the hardcore scene consisted only of people "completely dedicated to the [[DIY]] ethics"; punk "[l]ifers without the ambition to one day settle into the study-work-family-house-retirement-death scenario".<ref>{{cite web |last=Symonds |first=Rene |url=http://www.drownedinsound.com/articles/2307017 |title=Features – Soul Brothers: DiS meets Bad Brains |work=Drowned in Sound |date=16 August 2007 |access-date=7 February 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011095854/http://drownedinsound.com/articles/2307017 |archive-date=11 October 2008}}</ref>

The [[Oi!|Oi]] band [[Combat 84]] has a song entitled "Poseur" which describes a person changing from a punk to a skinhead, and then into a Mod and a Ted. The lyrics include the lines "Poseur poseur standing there/You change your style every year."

In 1985, [[MTV]] aired a concert documentary, featuring performances by [[Charged GBH|GBH]] and [[the Dickies]], entitled ''Punks and Poseurs: A Journey Through the Los Angeles Underground''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dangerousminds.net/comments/vintage_mtv_punks_and_poseurs|title=Vintage MTV: 'Punks and Poseurs: A Journey Through the Los Angeles Underground'|date=21 August 2014|website=Dangerousminds.net|access-date=5 September 2020}}</ref>

====1990s–2000s====
Dave Rimmer writes that with the revival of punk ideals of stripped-down music in the early 1990s, with [[grunge]] musicians like "[Kurt] [[Kurt Cobain|Cobain]], and lots of kids like him, rock & roll ... threw down a dare: Can you be pure enough, day after day, year after year, to prove your authenticity, to live up to the music [or else] live with being a poseur, a phony, a [[sellout]]?"<ref name=autogenerated1 />

[[Refused]]'s [[Dennis Lyxzén]] and [[Bad Religion]]'s [[Brett Gurewitz]] used the term to refer to early 2000s-era [[pop punk]] fans as "kids – more specifically the new wave of punk poseurs who came to the music via bands like [[Good Charlotte]]". They argue that these young listeners want "not to have to think and [instead they] would rather use music as [[escapism]] [,] and too many bands seem willing to comply".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.exclaim.ca/articles/coverstory.aspx?csid1=60|title=Exclaim!

Ron Quintana wrote that when [[Metallica]] was trying to find a place in the LA metal scene in the early 1980s, it was difficult for the band to "play their [heavy] music and win over a crowd in a land where poseurs ruled and anything fast and heavy was ignored".<ref>{{cite web|last=Quintana |first=Ron |title=Metallica |url=http://www.artistwd.com/joyzine/music/metallica/history.php |publisher=artistwd.com / first published in Thrash Metal, US |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707165906/http://www.artistwd.com/joyzine/music/metallica/history.php |archive-date=7 July 2011 }}</ref>

In an article on [[Axl Rose]], entitled "Ex–'White-Boy Poseur'", Rose admitted that he has had "time to reflect on heavy-metal posturing" of the last few decades: "We thought we were so badass [...] Then [[N.W.A]] came out rapping about this world where you walk out of your house and you get shot.

In the [[Alestorm]] song "Heavy Metal Pirates", numerous metaphors and allusions to pirates are made, including references to cutlasses, and it includes the line "[[No quarter]] for the poseurs, we'll bring 'em death and pain". The [[Manowar]] song "Metal Warriors" includes the lines: "Heavy metal or no metal at all whimps and posers leave the hall" and "...all whimps and posers go on, get out".

===Goth subculture===

Nancy Kilpatrick's ''Goth Bible: A Compendium for the Darkly Inclined'' defines "poseur" for the goth scene as: "goth wannabes, usually young kids going through a goth phase who do not hold to goth sensibilities but want to be part of the goth crowd...". Kilpatrick dismisses poseur goths as "Batbabies" whose clothing is bought at [mall store] [[Hot Topic]] with their parents' money.<ref>Nancy Kilpatrick's ''Goth Bible: A Compendium for the Darkly Inclined'' 2004. page 24</ref>

===Hip hop subculture===

[[File:Breakdance-oldschool.png|thumb|right|Authenticity or "street cred" is important in hip-hop culture]]
In the [[hip hop]] scene, authenticity or ''street cred'' is important. The word [[wigger]] is the specific used to refer to caucasian people mimicking black hip-hop culture. Larry Nager of ''The Cincinnati Enquirer'' wrote that rapper [[50 Cent]] has "earned the right to use the trappings of gangsta rap – the macho posturing, the guns, the drugs, the big cars and magnums of champagne. He's not a poseur pretending to be a gangsta; he's the real thing."<ref>{{cite web|last=Nager|first=Larry|title=50 Cent's performance won't propel rapper to next level|url=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:trRANTublH0J:enquirer.com/editions/2003/02/23/tem_50cent23.html|publisher=The Cincinnati Enquirer|access-date=30 July 2012}}</ref>

A ''This Are Music'' review of white rapper [[Rob Aston]] criticizes his "fake-gangsta posturing", calling him "a poseur faux-thug cross-bred with a junk punk" who glorifies "guns, bling, cars, bitches, and heroin" to the point that he seems like a parody.<ref>{{cite web|title=Diamonds and Lint, October 18th, 2007 |url=http://www.thisaremusic.com/reviews/diamonds-and-lint |publisher=This Are Music |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080223061558/http://www.thisaremusic.com/reviews/diamonds-and-lint |archive-date=23 February 2008 }}</ref> A 2004 article on BlackAmericaWeb claims that Russell Tyrone Jones, better known as rapper [[Ol' Dirty Bastard]], was not "a rough dude from the 'hood" as his official record company biographies claimed. After Jones' death from drugs, the rapper's father claimed that "his late son was a hip-hop poseur, contrary to what music trade magazines published in New York" wrote. Jones' father argued that the "story about him being raised in the Fort Greene [Brooklyn] projects on welfare until he was a child of 13 was a total lie"; instead, he said "their son grew up in a reasonably stable two-parent, two-income home in Brooklyn".

The article also refers to another "hip-hop poseur from a decade ago", [[Lichelle Laws|Lichelle "Boss" Laws]]. While her record company promoted her as "the most gangsta of girl gangstas", posing her "with automatic weapons" and publicizing claims about prison time and an upbringing on the "hard-knock streets of Detroit", Laws' parents claim that they put her "through private school and enrolled [her] in college in suburban Detroit".<ref>{{cite web|last=Dawkins |first=Wayne |title=Commentary: Middle-class rappers who extol thug life insult parents |url=http://www.blackamericaweb.com/site.aspx/sayitloud/odb1223 |publisher=BlackAmericaWeb.com, Inc |access-date=30 July 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050428033613/http://www.blackamericaweb.com/site.aspx/sayitloud/odb1223 |archive-date=28 April 2005 }}</ref>

As hip hop has gained a more mainstream popularity, it has spread to new audiences, including well-to-do "white hip-hop kids with gangsta aspirations—dubbed the 'Prep-School Gangsters'" by journalist [[Nancy Jo Sales]]. Sales claims that these hip hop fans "wore Polo and Hilfiger gear trendy among East Coast hip-hop acts" and rode downtown to black neighborhoods in chauffeured limos to experience the ghetto life. Then, "to guard against being labeled poseurs, the prep schoolers started to steal the gear that their parents could readily afford".<ref>{{cite web|title=Peddling the Street: Gangsta Wannabes, Allen Iverson, and Black Masculinity (Under the Boards: The Cultural Revolution in Basketball, University of Nebraska Press/Bison Books, May 2007) |url=http://www.undertheboards.com/excerpts.html |access-date=16 July 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100110062908/http://www.undertheboards.com/excerpts.html |archive-date=10 January 2010 }}</ref> This trend was highlighted in [[The Offspring]] song "[[Pretty Fly (for a White Guy)]]".

A 2008,'' Utne Reader'' article describes the rise of "[[hipster (contemporary subculture)|Hipster]] Rap", which "consists of the most recent crop of MCs and DJs who flout conventional hip-hop fashions, eschewing baggy clothes and gold chains for tight jeans, big sunglasses, the occasional [[keffiyeh]], and other trappings of the hipster lifestyle". The article says this "hipster rap" has been criticized by the hip hop website [[Unkut]] and rapper Mazzi, who call the mainstream rappers ''poseurs'' or "fags for copping the [[metrosexual]] appearances of hipster fashion".<ref>{{cite web|last=Mohan |first=Jake |title=Hipster Rap: The Latest Hater Battleground |url=http://www.utne.com/2008-06-13/Arts/Hipster-Rap-The-Latest-Hater-Battleground.aspx |publisher=Ogden Publications, Inc. |access-date=30 July 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604161304/http://www.utne.com/2008-06-13/Arts/Hipster-Rap-The-Latest-Hater-Battleground.aspx |archive-date=4 June 2011 }}</ref> ''Prefix Mag'' writer Ethan Stanislawski argues that there "have been a slew of angry retorts to the rise of hipster rap", which he says can be summed up as "white kids want the funky otherness of hip-hop [...] without all the scary black people".<ref>{{cite web|last=Stanislawski|first=Ethan|title=The Chicago Reader has hip-hop hipster backlash against hip-hop hipster backlash|url=http://www.prefixmag.com/news/hip-hop-hipster-backlash/19451/|publisher=Prefix Mag', 20 June 2008|access-date=30 July 2012|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120927025524/http://www.prefixmag.com/news/hip-hop-hipster-backlash/19451/|archive-date=27 September 2012}}</ref>

The [[skateboarding]] subculture attempts to differentiate between authentic skaters and pretenders. A ''New York Times'' article on the 2007 skateboarding scene notes that "some first-time skaters drawn into the sport by catchy choruses or candy-colored sneakers are dismissed as poseurs" who are "walking around with a skateboard as an accessory, holding it in a way we call 'the mall grab.'"<ref>{{cite web |last=Detrick |first=Ben |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/11/fashion/11skaters.html?pagewanted=print |title=Skateboarding Rolls Out of the Suburbs – New York Times |location=Brooklyn (NYC) |work=The New York Times |date=11 November 2007 |access-date=7 February 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150605044406/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/11/fashion/11skaters.html?pagewanted=print |archive-date=5 June 2015}}</ref> In the 1988 video game ''[[Skate or Die!]]'', "Poseur Pete" is the name of the challenger for beginner-level players.

The concept of a "jazz poseur" dates back to the 1940s. Bob White from ''[[Downbeat (magazine)|Downbeat]]'' argued that some jazz critics knew nothing about new jazz ([[bebop]]) and nothing about chords, tone, or the technical aspects of jazz; instead, they would just learn the names of a few old masters and "...become a romantic, a charlatan, a poseur, a pseudo-intellectual, an aesthetic snob, ...well on the way to success" as a jazz critic.<ref>''The Rise of a Jazz Art World.''
