'''Immunization during pregnancy''' is the administration of a [[vaccine]] to a [[pregnancy|pregnant]] individual.<ref name=Vesikari2021>{{cite book |last1=Vesikari|first1=Timo |last2=Maertens|first2=Kirsten |last3=Finn|first3=Adam|editor1-last=Vesikari |editor1-first=Timo |editor2-last=Damme |editor2-first=Pierre Van |title=Pediatric Vaccines and Vaccinations: A European Textbook |date=2021 |publisher=Springer |edition=Second|location=Switzerland |isbn=978-3-030-77172-0 |pages=49–53 |chapter=6.

Other vaccines may be offered during pregnancy where travel-related or occupational exposure to disease-causing organisms warrant this. However, certain vaccines are contra-indicated in pregnancy. These include vaccines that include [[attenuated vaccine|live attenuated]] organisms, such as the [[MMR vaccine|MMR]] and [[BCG vaccine|BCG]] vaccines, since there is a potential risk that these could infect the fetus.

==Tetanus and whooping cough vaccination in pregnancy==
Newborns are at increased risk of infection, particularly before they receive their first infant vaccinations. For this reason, certain vaccinations are offered during pregnancy in order to induce an antibody response, resulting in the passage of [[antibody]] across the [[placenta]] and into the [[fetus]]: this confers [[passive immunity]] on the newborn. As early as 1879, it was noted that infants born following smallpox vaccination in pregnancy were themselves protected against smallpox.<ref>{{cite journal |last1= de Martino |first1= Maurizio. |date= 2016|title= Dismantling the Taboo against Vaccines in Pregnancy|journal= International Journal of Molecular Sciences |volume= 17|issue= 6|pages= 894|doi= 10.3390/ijms17060894|pmid= 27338346 |pmc= 4926428 |doi-access= free }}</ref> However, the original smallpox vaccination was never widely used during pregnancy because, as a live vaccine, its use is contraindicated.{{cn|date=July 2023}}

[[Tetanus]] is a bacterial infection caused by [[Clostridium tetani]]. [[Neonatal tetanus|Newborns can be infected]] via their unhealed umbilical stump, particularly when the umbilical cord is cut with a non-sterile instrument, and suffer a generalised infection. The [[tetanus vaccine|tetanus toxoid vaccine]] was first licensed for use in 1938 and, during the 1960s, it was noted that tetanus vaccination in pregnancy could prevent neonatal tetanus.<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Schofield|first1= FD |last2= Tucker|first2= VM| last3= Westbook|first3= GR |date= 1961|title= Neonatal tetanus in New Guinea.

[[Whooping cough]], or pertussis, is a contagious respiratory disease caused by the bacteria [[Bordetella pertussis]]. It is fatal in an estimated 0.5% of infants in the USA.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/about/complications.html | title=Complications of Whooping Cough (Pertussis) &#124; CDC | date=April 2021 }}</ref> The first vaccine against whooping cough was developed in the 1930s, and in the 1940s a study found that vaccination in pregnancy protected infants against developing whooping cough.<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Cohen|first1= Philip|last2= Scandron|first2= Samuel|date= 1943|title= The placental transmission of protective antibodies against whooping cough: by inoculation of the pregnant mother|url= https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/260204|journal= JAMA|volume= 121|issue= 9|pages= 656–662|doi= 10.1001/jama.1943.02840090026008}}</ref>

The tetanus and whooping cough vaccinations are generally administered in combination during pregnancy, for example as the [[DTaP]] vaccine (which also protects against diphtheria) or the 4-in-1 vaccine (which also protects against diphtheria and polio).{{cn|date=July 2023}}

==Influenza vaccination in pregnancy==
[[Influenza]] is a respiratory infection caused by [[influenza virus]]es. Pregnant women are disproportionately affected by influenza: in the 1918 pandemic, mortality rates as high as 27% were reported in this population and in the 1957 pandemic, nearly 20% of deaths in pregnancy were attributed to influenza. In the 2009 pandemic, even with medical advances, pregnant women accounted for a disproportionately high percentage of deaths.<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Pazos|first1= Michael|last2= Sperling|first2= Rhoda|last3 = Moran | first3 = Thomas | last4 = Kraus | first4 = Thomas | date= 2012|title= The influence of pregnancy on systemic immunity |journal= Immunologic Research |volume= 54|issue= 1–3| pages= 254–61|doi= 10.1007/s12026-012-8303-9|pmid= 22447351|pmc= 7091327}}</ref>

The influenza vaccine was first used in the US military from 1938, and then in the civilian population from the 1940s. Given the increased risk of influenza during pregnancy, public health bodies in the USA recommended that pregnant women should be prioritised for influenza vaccination from the 1960s,<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Burney|first1= Leroy|date= 1960|title= Influenza immunization: Statement |journal= Public Health Reports  |volume= 75|issue= 10|pages= 944|doi= 10.2307/4590965|jstor= 4590965|pmid= 19316369|pmc= 1929542}}</ref> with the CDC endorsing the recommendation from 1997.<ref>{{cite journal |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date= 1997|title= Prevention and Control of Influenza: Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)|url= https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00047346.htm|journal= MMWR|volume= 46| pages= 1–25}}</ref> However, it was not until 2005 that a randomised clinical trial formally demonstrated the efficacy of influenza vaccination in pregnancy.<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Zaman|first1 = K| last2= Roy|first2= Eliza| last3 = Arifeen| first3 = Shams | last4 = Rahman | first4 = Mahbubur | last5 = Raqib |first5 = Rubhana | last6 = Wilson | first6 =Emily | last7 = Omer | first7 = Saad | last8 = Shahid | first8 = Nigar | last9 = Brieman | first9 = Robert | last10 = Steinhoff | first10 = Mark| date= 2008 |title= Effectiveness of Maternal Influenza Immunization in Mothers and Infants |url= https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa0708630?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov |journal= New England Journal of Medicine|volume= 359 |issue = 15|pages= 1555–1564 |doi= 10.1056/NEJMoa0708630|pmid = 18799552|s2cid = 205089531}}</ref>

Following the 2009 pandemic, both Australia and the UK added influenza vaccination to the recommended schedule for pregnant women.{{cn|date=July 2023}}

==COVID-19 vaccination in pregnancy==
{{See also|COVID-19 in pregnancy}}
[[COVID-19]] is a respiratory infection caused by the [[SARS-CoV2]] virus. Before COVID-19 vaccines were available, pregnant women who caught the disease were at increased risk of needing intensive care, invasive ventilation or ECMO, but not at increased risk of death.<ref>{{Cite journal |date=2022-05-30 |title=Update to living systematic review on covid-19 in pregnancy |journal=BMJ (Clinical Research Ed.) |volume=377 |pages=o1205 |doi=10.1136/bmj.o1205 |issn=1756-1833 |pmid=35636775|s2cid=249157852 |doi-access=free }}</ref> Infection significantly increased the risk of preterm birth, stillbirth and pre-eclampsia.<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Marchand|first1= Greg|last2= Patil|first2= Avinash| last3 = Masoud | first3 = Ahmed | last4 = Ware | first4 = Kelly | last5 = King | first5 = Alexa | last6 = Ruther | first6 = Stacey | last7 = Brazil| first7 = Giovanna | last8 = Calteux | first8 = Nicolas | last9 = Ulibarri| first9 = Hollie | last10 = Parise |first10 = Julia | last11 = Arroyo | first11 = Amanda | last12 = Coriel | first12 = Catherine | last13 = Cook | first13 = Chelsea | last14 = Ruuska | first14 = Alexandra |last15 = Nourlden| first15 = Anas Zakarya | last16 = Sainz | first16 = Katelyn |  date= 2022|title= Systematic review and meta-analysis of COVID-19 maternal and neonatal clinical features and pregnancy outcomes up to June 3, 2021

COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy is safe and associated with improved levels of risk for [[stillbirth]], [[premature birth]] and admission of the newborn to [[intensive care]]. Vaccination can prevent COVID-19 infection during pregnancy although these immunity benefits are not passed on to the child.<ref name="pmid36896895">{{cite journal |vauthors=Rahmati M, Yon DK, Lee SW, Butler L, Koyanagi A, Jacob L, Shin JI, Smith L |title=Effects of COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy on SARS-CoV-2 infection and maternal and neonatal outcomes: A systematic review and meta-analysis |journal=Rev Med Virol |volume= 33|issue= 3|pages=e2434 |date=March 2023 |pmid=36896895 |doi=10.1002/rmv.2434 |s2cid=257429897 |type=Systematic review |display-authors=5}}</ref>

mRNA COVID-19 vaccines were first rolled out in December 2020. At this time, in recognition of the risks posed by COVID-19 disease in pregnancy, the US and Israel offered the vaccines to all pregnant women shortly afterwards, and the first safety and effectiveness data therefore came from these vaccines and these nations.<ref name = "Male">{{cite journal | last1 = Male |first1 = Victoria | date = 2022 | title = SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 vaccination in pregnancy | journal = Nature Reviews Immunology | volume = 22 | issue = 5 | pages = 277–282 |  doi = 10.1038/s41577-022-00703-6 |pmid = 35304596 |pmc = 8931577 }}</ref>

==Rubella vaccination to prevent fetal disease==
[[Rubella]], or German measles, is an infection caused by the [[rubella virus]]. In childhood, it usually causes a mild disease but infection in pregnancy can result in fetal infection, or [[congenital rubella syndrome]], which causes neonatal deaths, deafness, blindness and intellectual disabilities. The first rubella vaccine was licensed for use in 1969, with its development largely spurred by the heavy burden of congenital rubella experienced in the 1960s.<ref>• {{cite journal |last1= Cooper|first1= LZ |date= 1985 |title= The history and medical consequences of rubella |url= https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3890105/ |journal= Reviews of Infectious Diseases |volume= 7|issue= Suppl 1 |pages= S2-10 |doi= 10.1093/clinids/7.supplement_1.s2|pmid= 3890105 }}</ref>

Because the rubella vaccine is a live attenuated vaccine, there is a theoretical risk that it could cause fetal infection, although this has never been seen to occur. Therefore, rubella vaccination is usually avoided during pregnancy. Rather, vaccination is offered to children to reduce the prevalence of rubella virus in circulation and/or to adolescent girls, to boost their immunity before they are likely to conceive.<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Miller|first1= CL|last2= Miller|first2= E | last3 = Waight | first3 = PA |date= 1987 |title= Rubella susceptibility and the continuing risk of infection in pregnancy| url = https://www.bmj.com/content/294/6582/1277| journal= BMJ (Clin Res Ed) | volume= 294|issue= 6582|pages= 1277–1278|doi= 10.1136/bmj.294.6582.1277|pmid= 3109615|pmc= 1246439}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1= Walker|first1= D|last2= Carter|first2= H| last3 = Jones | first3 = IG | date= 1986|title= Measles, mumps, and rubella: the need for a change in immunisation policy |journal= BMJ (Clin Res Ed) |volume= 292|issue= 6534|pages= 1501–1502|doi= 10.1136/bmj.292.6534.1501|pmid= 3087495|pmc= 1340503}}</ref>
