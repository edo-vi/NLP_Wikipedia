==Film summary==
"[[Spanish Flea]]" and "[[Tijuana Taxi]]" are soundtracks to two separate cartoons. In "Spanish Flea", a [[flea]] bothers various animals until it is chased away from them by a group of men. In "Tijuana Taxi", a rickety and old purple taxi in [[Tijuana]] picks up a disproportionate number of people who have to catch a plane at the local airport. After a crazy ride through the streets of Tijuana (including a short visit to a [[bullfighting]] arena), the taxi driver is delayed by a [[customs officer]], who takes a long time in stamping the passports for the driver's numerous customers, and he misses the plane. However, he makes up for it by having his taxi fly away. 

The music used to introduce the film during its opening credits is the band's "The Mexican Shuffle."

==Film preservation==
