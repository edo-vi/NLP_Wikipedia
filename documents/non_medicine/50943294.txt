=== Abusive conduct and suspension ===
[[USA Gymnastics]] officials first received abuse complaints against Haney in 2016.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ocregister.com/usa-gymnastics-hearing-on-abuse-charges-against-maggie-haney-opens-monday|title=USA Gymnastics hearing on abuse charges against Maggie Haney opens Monday|date=2020-02-03|website=Orange County Register|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-23}}</ref> In August 2019, it was announced Haney was under investigation by USA Gymnastics over allegations of [[Verbal abuse|verbal]] and [[Psychological abuse|emotional abuse]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Reid |first1=Scott M. |title=Maggie Haney, coach of Olympic and world champion gymnasts, under investigation |url=https://www.ocregister.com/2019/08/19/maggie-haney-coach-of-olympic-and-world-champion-gymnasts-under-investigation/ |website=The Orange County Register |date=20 August 2019 |accessdate=20 August 2019}}</ref> At least a half dozen families filed complaints against Haney, alleging that she instructed injured gymnasts to remove casts and continue training, as well as screaming at and threatening gymnasts.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.ocregister.com/maggie-haney-suspended-by-usa-gymnastics|title=Maggie Haney suspended by USA Gymnastics|date=2020-02-04|website=Orange County Register|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-23}}</ref> On February 3, 2020, her hearing on the allegations began. She was suspended from coaching minor athletes pending the outcome of the hearing.<ref name=":0" />

During the hearing, testimony was given regarding major injuries suffered by Haney's athletes. Her two most prominent students, [[Laurie Hernandez]] and [[Riley McCusker]], both testified - Hernandez verbally, and McCusker through a written statement.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|url=https://www.ocregister.com/2020/04/29/maggie-haney-suspended-8-years-by-usa-gymnastics|title=Maggie Haney suspended 8 years by USA Gymnastics|date=April 30, 2020}}</ref> McCusker, a world champion trained by Haney, suffered [[rhabdomyolysis]], a muscle condition linked to overtraining, in 2019.<ref name="autogenerated1" /> The hearing lasted 13 days over two months - February and March.<ref name=":6">{{Cite web|title=Special report: Families detail Maggie Haney's abuse of young gymnasts|url=https://www.ocregister.com/special-report-families-detail-maggie-haneys-abuse-of-young-gymnasts|date=2020-05-08|website=Orange County Register|language=en-US|access-date=2020-05-09}}</ref> In March, USA Gymnastics suspended Victoria Levine, a coach and co-owner of MG Elite Gymnastics, due to allegations that she also was verbally abusive to athletes.<ref>{{Cite web|title=USA Gymnastics suspends Victoria Levine, co-owner of Maggie Haney's NJ gym|url=https://www.ocregister.com/usa-gymnastics-suspends-victoria-levine-co-owner-of-maggie-haneys-nj-gym|date=2020-03-18|website=Orange County Register|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-23}}</ref>

After the hearing, further details of the testimony came to light. Haney pulled gymnasts by their hair, swore and screamed at them - often calling them "[[Retard (pejorative)|retarded]]" - and threatened to commit suicide if top gymnasts left her program.<ref name=":6" /> Haney pressured gymnasts to remove casts and train or compete while injured.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":6" /> Parents were not allowed in the gymnastic club during practices, and Haney warned gymnasts not to complain about her coaching methods to their parents. When gymnasts made mistakes in training, Haney kicked them out of the gym. Gymnasts hid their menstrual periods from Haney, who told them that menstruating was proof that they were too fat. Gymnasts reported suffering from anxiety, depression, and [[eating disorder]]s due to Haney's abuse.<ref name=":6" />

In one incident, Haney and her assistant coach Victoria Levine refused to spot a gymnast as she attempted a new skill on the uneven bars. The gymnast fell and struck her head against exposed concrete before landing in a foam pit. Haney and Levine laughed at the gymnast until they realized she was having [[Epileptic seizure|seizures]]. The gymnast had two skull fractures.<ref name=":6" />

On April 29, Haney was suspended for eight years by USA Gymnastics for verbally and emotionally abusing gymnasts.<ref name=":3">{{Cite web|title=USA Gymnastics suspends coach Maggie Haney for 8 years|url=https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/30/us/usa-gymnastics-coach-maggie-haney-suspended-trnd/index.html|first=Jason |last=Hanna|website=CNN|date=April 30, 2020 |access-date=2020-04-30}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|agency=Reuters|date=2020-04-30|title=USA Gymnastics suspends ex-Olympic coach Maggie Haney for eight years|language=en-GB|work=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/30/usa-gymnastics-maggie-haney|access-date=2020-04-30|issn=0261-3077}}</ref><ref name=":4">{{Cite news|last=Allentuck|first=Danielle|date=2020-04-29|title=Maggie Haney, Elite Gymnastics Coach, Is Suspended for 8 Years|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/29/sports/gymnastics-coach-banned-maggie-haney.html|access-date=2020-04-30|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> She is prohibited from coaching USA Gymnastics athletes during this period,<ref name=":3" /><ref name=":4" /> cannot contact the claimants, and cannot attend USA Gymnastics events unless accompanying her gymnast daughter.<ref name=":2" /> The sentence was later reduced to 5 years during an appeal.  The arbitrator at the hearing found that some of the evidence presented was improperly used against Haney. She may reapply for membership after her suspension, but must go through an additional two-year probationary period and complete [[United States Center for SafeSport]] courses.<ref name=":2" /><ref name=":4" /><ref>{{Cite web|title=USA Gymnastics suspends coach Maggie Haney for 8 years|url=https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/30/us/usa-gymnastics-coach-maggie-haney-suspended-trnd/index.html|first=Jason |last=Hanna|website=CNN|date=April 30, 2020 |access-date=2020-05-14}}</ref>

Haney was reported in late 2020 to be still coaching gymnasts  despite the suspension.<ref>[https://www.ocregister.com/2020/09/04/special-report-maggie-haney-still-working-with-gymnasts-despite-suspension "Special report: Maggie Haney still working with gymnasts despite suspension" ''OC Register''] (Sept. 4,2020).
