A '''phageome''' is a community of [[bacteriophage]]s and their metagenomes localized in a particular environment, similar to a [[microbiome]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ma Y, You X, Mai G, Tokuyasu T, Liu C | title = A human gut phage catalog correlates the gut phageome with type 2 diabetes | journal = Microbiome | volume = 6 | issue = 1 | pages = 24 | date = February 2018 | pmid = 29391057 | pmc = 5796561 | doi = 10.1186/s40168-018-0410-y }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Townsend EM, Kelly L, Muscatt G, Box JD, Hargraves N, Lilley D, Jameson E | title = The Human Gut Phageome: Origins and Roles in the Human Gut Microbiome | journal = Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology | volume = 11 | pages = 643214 | date = 2021-06-04 | pmid = 34150671 | pmc = 8213399 | doi = 10.3389/fcimb.2021.643214 | doi-access = free }}</ref> The term was first used in an article by Modi ''et al'' in 2013<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Modi SR, Lee HH, Spina CS, Collins JJ | title = Antibiotic treatment expands the resistance reservoir and ecological network of the phage metagenome | journal = Nature | volume = 499 | issue = 7457 | pages = 219–222 | date = July 2013 | pmid = 23748443 | doi = 10.1038/nature12212 | pmc = 3710538 | bibcode = 2013Natur.499..219M }}</ref> and has continued to be used in scientific articles that relate to bacteriophages and their metagenomes. A [[bacteriophage]], or phage for short, is a virus that has the ability to infect bacteria and archaea, and can replicate inside of them. Phageome is a subcategory of [[virome]], which is all of the viruses that are associated with a host or environment.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Virgin HW | title = The virome in mammalian physiology and disease | journal = Cell | volume = 157 | issue = 1 | pages = 142–150 | date = March 2014 | pmid = 24679532 | pmc = 3977141 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2014.02.032 }}</ref> Phages make up the majority of most viromes and are currently understood as being the most abundant organism.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Keen EC | title = A century of phage research: bacteriophages and the shaping of modern biology | journal = BioEssays | volume = 37 | issue = 1 | pages = 6–9 | date = January 2015 | pmid = 25521633 | pmc = 4418462 | doi = 10.1002/bies.201400152 }}</ref> Oftentimes scientists will look only at a phageome instead of a virome while conducting research.

Although bacteriophages do not have the capability to infect human cells, they are found in abundance in the [[human virome]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Górska A, Peter S, Willmann M, Autenrieth I, Schlaberg R, Huson DH | title = Dynamics of the human gut phageome during antibiotic treatment | journal = Computational Biology and Chemistry | volume = 74 | pages = 420–427 | date = June 2018 | pmid = 29567068 | doi = 10.1016/j.compbiolchem.2018.03.011 | s2cid = 4222429 }}</ref> 

The human gut phageome has recently become a topic of interest in the scientific community. The makeup of the gut phageome can be responsible for different gut related diseases such as IBD. The composition of phages that make up a healthy human gut phageome is currently debated, since different methods of research can lead to different results.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Shkoporov AN, Ryan FJ, Draper LA, Forde A, Stockdale SR, Daly KM, McDonnell SA, Nolan JA, Sutton TD, Dalmasso M, McCann A, Ross RP, Hill C | display-authors = 6 | title = Reproducible protocols for metagenomic analysis of human faecal phageomes | journal = Microbiome | volume = 6 | issue = 1 | pages = 68 | date = April 2018 | pmid = 29631623 | pmc = 5892011 | doi = 10.1186/s40168-018-0446-z }}</ref>
