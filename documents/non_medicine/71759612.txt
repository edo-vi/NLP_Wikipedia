== Geologic applications of aerial photographs ==

=== Landslide hazard assessment ===
Aerial photographs play an important role in assessing the risk of different natural hazards, particularly landslides.<ref name=":0" /> They can be used to determine whether hillslopes are stable or not.<ref name=":0" /> They can also record the history of landslides experienced in that area.<ref name=":0" /> For example, in an area with more than half of the ground surface constitutes [[Natural environment|natural terrain]], which is the unmodified natural environment, there are more slopes.<ref name=":0" /> The majority of naturally occurring landslides happen in isolated locations, posing a threat to ongoing development.<ref name=":0" /> Aerial photographs can be used to find all current and historical landslides in and around the research region to gauge vulnerability to future landslides.<ref name=":0" />

A '''landslide scar''' refers to the local area disrupted by the landslide.<ref name=":3" /> It comprises the starting point, also called the "source", the detached substances and a trail that describes the movement of a landslide.<ref name=":3" /> Every landslide scar is noted, along with its position, size, and the estimated date of the event. For the '''current landslides''', in the photograph, they can be recognized easily by the unique light-colored landslide scar.<ref name=":0" /> Very few plants can be observed on the scar.<ref name=":0" /> For '''historical or old landslides''', they may be hidden by vegetation such as bushes and woody plants, but scars in the land are still present.<ref name=":0" /> This type of landslide is recognized by a concave [[Depression (geology)|depression]] that appears on a major steep slope.<ref name=":0" /> Depression is when a feature is lowered compared to its surroundings. It is important to take into account the age of historical [[Landslide|landslides]] and assess their applicability to the present climate and environment.<ref name=":3" />

It shows how the yellow current landslides were identified within the red study area on the slopes of the natural terrain using interpretation techniques. A total of seven current landslides were identified. The numbers and years of occurrence are marked with the respective current landslides.<ref name=":0" /> (not in scale)|right|220x220px]]

=== Determining geological structures and types of rock ===
Aerial photographs can be used to identify different rock types on the rock exposure and the arrangement of the geological structures.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":3" /> These structures are produced by [[Deformation (physics)|deformation]] processes during [[Plate tectonics|tectonic movement]], such as [[Fault (geology)|faults]] and [[Fold (geology)|folds]]. Geologists identify different geological features and structures based on [[Lineament|photo-lineaments]].<ref name=":2" /><ref name=":0" /> Photo-lineaments are lines that appear on the photos and are thought to be driven by geological factors.<ref name=":0" /> Those identified photo-lineaments are aligned with the [[Linearity|linear]] topographic landforms.<ref name=":0" /> They can be referred to as [[Joint (geology)|joints]], faults, [[Dike (geology)|dikes]], or [[Contact (geology)|rock contacts]].<ref name=":0" /> Some faults may even occur along rivers and mountain valleys.<ref name=":0" />

For example, in Hong Kong the two major rocks are [[granite]] (35%) and [[volcanic rock]] (50%).<ref name=":0" /> Since granite is more easily weathered and eroded than volcanic rocks, it usually forms gullies, which are the valleys on a smaller scale, whereas volcanic rocks form the summit, which is the location with a higher elevation in the mountains.<ref name=":3" /><ref name=":0" />

The black dash lines refer to some local faults which are determined according to the [[Lineament|photo-lineaments]]. The yellow area is the deposits. The pale blue area is [[volcanic rock]]. The blue area (bottom right) is [[rhyolite]]. The pink area is [[granite]]. The red line is the research area that is located on a hillslope in [[North Lantau New Town|North Lantau]], Hong Kong.<ref name=":0" /> (not in scale)|left]]
Another example of determining geological structures is a fold found in Wyoming in the United States.<ref name=":5">Lisle, R. J. (2003). Dupin's indicatrix: a tool for quantifying periclinal folds on maps. ''Geological magazine'', ''140''(6), 721–726.</ref> A fold is developed when the rock layers are squeezed and curved by forces and do not break during the deformation.<ref name=":8">''[https://www.geologypage.com/2015/12/geological-folds.html Geological Folds]''. (26 December 2015). Geology Page. https://www.geologypage.com/2015/12/geological-folds.html</ref> It is an [[anticline]] which has the earliest-formed rock layers in the inner part and the youngest rock layer on the outer part of the fold.<ref>De Paor, D. G., Dordevic, M. M., Karabinos, P., Tewksbury, B. J., & Whitmeyer, S. J. (2016). The fold analysis challenge: A virtual globe-based educational resource. ''Journal of Structural Geology'', ''85'', 85–94.</ref><ref name=":7">The National Park Service. (7 December 2021). [https://www.nps.gov/subjects/geology/gri-glossary-of-geologic-terms.htm Glossary of Geologic Terms]. NPS.gov (U.S. National Park Service). Retrieved 5 November 2022, from https://www.nps.gov/subjects/geology/gri-glossary-of-geologic-terms.htm</ref> The [[Fold (geology)|hinge line]] of this fold, which refers to a line tracing the maximum bend of the fold structure, is not a straight line.<ref name=":7" /><ref name=":5" /> The head and the tail of the hinge line dip downward from the original horizontal plane. It is an [[Fold (geology)|asymmetrical fold]] which means the axial plane is not in the upright orientation but inclined.<ref name=":8" /> The [[Transverse plane|axial plane]] is a hypothetical plane dividing two sides of the fold.<ref name=":8" /> The limbs dip in opposite directions and are formed by tilted [[sedimentary rock]] layers.<ref name=":5" /> Limbs belong to the straight sections on the two sides of a fold. Aerial photographs are helpful for geologists to observe large-scale geological structures without spending large amounts of time in fields.

=== Boulder survey ===
Boulder surveys determine and categorize the areas of boulders using aerial photograph interpretation.<ref name=":0" /> After the survey the properties (dimension, amount, form) of boulders are combined with the geological map. This helps detect dangers from the [[Rockfall|falling]] of these large rock pieces, especially when conducting new projects close to the hillsides.<ref name=":0" />

Dense forests may obstruct the view of boulders from aerial photographs, which is one of the limitations of using aerial photographs to conduct a boulder survey.<ref name=":0" /> Therefore, old aerial photographs with less vegetation are usually more beneficial for boulder mapping. Hillslopes are often occupied by some small village houses which produce a shadow.<ref name=":0" /> These factors may decrease the efficiency of the boulder survey whereas bare ground allows for typically good sight of the terrain.<ref name=":0" /> [[File:A sketch map from the boulder survey.jpg|thumb|Sketch map of the results of a boulder survey in [[Lantau Island|Northern Lantau Island]] in Hong Kong. Different colors of areas show varying densities of boulders.<ref name=":0" />|left]] Geologists mark down the locations of the boulders on maps after making observations from aerial photographs to develop a sense of the possible boulder locations before going to the site. For example, from figure 17, it is observed that several boulders were settled on the hillslopes along the nearby footpaths. From the vertical view of the aerial photograph, the positions and relative dimensions of the boulders can be determined and measured easily. For an initial assessment of boulders on a wide and isolated landscape, conducting a boulder survey is necessary.<ref name=":0" /> 

=== Studying landforms ===
Aerial photographs can be used to help study, recognize, and classify landforms, which refers to the topographical characteristics created by the [[Environment (systems)|environmental systems]].<ref name=":0" /> They usually contain some distinct components and sets of features.<ref name=":0" /> Certain fundamental spatial distributions of features are used to distinguish different landforms.<ref name=":0" /> Differences in terrain surface elevation, river flow, colors of the aerial photographs, spatial distribution of tones, and the occurrence of plant covers are considered during landform studies.<ref name=":0" /> [[Drainage divide|Watersheds]], which refer to the regions that separate [[drainage basin]]s, are able to be defined using small-scale aerial photographs.<ref name=":3" /> Landform studies also help identify decreases in surface elevation in natural terrain. and river courses<ref name=":3" />

=== Regolith mapping ===
[[Regolith]] mapping helps distinguish different kinds of [[superficial deposits]] which refer to loosely arranged [[Aggregate (geology)|aggregates]] of weathered materials on the land surface.<ref name=":0" /><ref>Hong Kong Geological Survey, Civil Engineering and Development Department. (2009). [https://hkss.cedd.gov.hk/hkss/eng/education/gs/eng/hkg/chapter4.htm?tab=2. ''Weathering & Erosion – Introduction to Geomorphological Processes''.]https://hkss.cedd.gov.hk/hkss/eng/education/gs/eng/hkg/chapter4.htm?tab=2.</ref> Aerial photographs can be used to establish the borders between the [[Fluvial processes|fluvial]] and gravity-driven hillslope [[sediment]]s.<ref name=":0" /> These superficial deposits usually have indistinct borders.<ref name=":0" /> Some examples of the deposits identified using regolith mapping are described below.

==== Valley colluvium ====
Valley [[colluvium]] refers to the loose, [[Soil consolidation|unconsolidated]] sediments that have been settled inside the water courses and are driven by river mechanisms.<ref name=":0" /> They are thin in shape and extended into straight lines that follow the [[Channel (geography)|river channels]].<ref name=":0" /> The plants grown on the valley colluvium are thicker than the nearby areas.<ref name=":0" /> Woody plants and large bushes dominate the vegetation.<ref name=":0" />

==== Debris fan colluvium ====
[[Alluvial fan|Debris fan]] [[colluvium]] refers to the aggregates of gravity-driven and [[Fluvial processes|fluvial]] [[Deposit (geology)|deposits]] located near the hillslope's base or the eroded [[catchment]] area.<ref name=":0" /> It appears shell-like from the vertical view and is cut by the flowing rivers.<ref name=":0" /> In certain parts of the debris fan, there may be some woody plants covering the land surface.<ref name=":0" /> 
[[File:Debris fan Furlo.JPG|thumb|Example of a small-scale colluvium [[Alluvial fan|debris fan]] in Italy. ]]

==== Agricultural terraces ====
Regolith mapping can also be used to determine disrupted natural landscapes in aerial photographs.<ref name=":0" /> For example, [[Terrace (earthworks)|agricultural terraces]], which refers to the level land surfaces divided by short back slopes and concrete barriers, is one of the disrupted landscapes.<ref name=":0" /> Back slopes refer to the slopes constructed by removing soil or rocks from hillslopes for nearby infrastructure. They were developed for the purpose of growing rice.<ref name=":0" /> The terraces are usually found on gentle slopes and bottom areas of the mountains.<ref name=":0" /> They are usually covered with thick vegetation when the terraces are abandoned, or the farming activities are no longer active.<ref name=":0" />
