'''Provenance''' in [[geology]], is the reconstruction of the origin of [[sediments]]. The Earth is a dynamic planet, and all rocks are subject to transition between the three main rock types: [[Sedimentary rock|sedimentary]], [[Metamorphic rock|metamorphic]], and [[igneous rock]]s (the [[rock cycle]]). Rocks exposed to the surface are sooner or later broken down into sediments. Sediments are expected to be able to provide evidence of the [[erosion]]al history of their parent source rocks. The purpose of provenance study is to restore the [[tectonic]], [[Paleogeography|paleo-geographic]] and [[Paleoclimatology|paleo-climatic]] history.

In the modern geological lexicon, "sediment provenance" specifically refers to the application of compositional analyses to determine the origin of sediments. This is often used in conjunction with the study of exhumation histories, interpretation of drainage networks and their evolution, and forward-modelling of paleo-earth systems. In combination, these help to characterise the "source to sink" journey of clastic sediments from [[hinterland (geology)|hinterland]] to [[sedimentary basin]].

== Introduction ==

[[Provenance]] (from the French provenir, "to come from"), is the place of origin or earliest known history of something.<ref>{{cite book|title=Oxford English Dictionary|year=1939 |url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.228324|publisher=Oxford University Press}}</ref> In geology (specifically, in [[sedimentary petrology]]), the term provenance deals with the question where sediments originate from. The purpose of sedimentary provenance studies is to reconstruct and to interpret the history of sediment from parent rocks at a source area to detritus at a burial place.<ref name="Weltje & von Eynatten 2004">{{cite journal|last1=Weltje, G.J. and von Eynatten, H.|title=Quantitative provenance analysis of sediments: review and outlook|journal=Sedimentary Geology|date=2004|doi=10.1016/j.sedgeo.2004.05.007|volume=171|issue=1–4|pages=1–11|bibcode=2004SedG..171....1W}}</ref> The ultimate goal of provenance studies is to investigate the characteristics of a source area by analyzing the composition and texture of sediments.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Pettijohn, F.J.|title=Sand and sandstone|publisher=Springer|page=553|display-authors=etal}}</ref> The studies of provenance involve the following aspects: "(1) the source(s) of the particles that make up the rocks, (2) the erosion and transport mechanisms that moved the particles from source areas to depositional sites, (3) the depositional setting and depositional processes responsible for sedimentation of the particles (the depositional environment), and (4) the physical and chemical conditions of the burial environment and diagenetic changes that occur in siliciclastic sediment during burial and uplift".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Boggs|first1=Sam|title=Petrology of sedimentary Rocks|date=1992}}</ref> Provenance studies are conducted to investigate many scientific questions, for example, the growth history of continental crust,<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Taylor and McLennan|title=The Geochemical Evolution of the continental crust|journal=Reviews of Geophysics|date=1995|doi=10.1029/95rg00262|bibcode=1995RvGeo..33..241T|volume=33|issue=2|pages=241}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=McLennan, S.

"Relations between provenance and basin are important for [[hydrocarbon exploration]] because sand frameworks of contrasting [[detrital]] compositions respond differently to [[diagenesis]], and thus display different trends of [[porosity]] reduction with depth of burial."<ref name = "Dickinson 1979"/>

== Source of detritus ==
All rock exposed at the Earth's surface is subjected to physical or chemical [[weathering]] and broken down into finer grained sediment. All three types of rocks (igneous, sedimentary and metamorphic rocks) can be the source of detritus.

== Transportation of detritus ==
[[File:Distribution of detritus.png|thumbnail|left|Distribution of detritus]]
Rocks are transported downstream from higher elevation to lower elevation. Source rocks and detritus are transported by gravity, water, wind or glacial movement. The transportation process breaks rocks into smaller particles by physical abrasion, from big boulder size into sand or even clay size. At the same time minerals within the sediment can also be changed chemically. Only minerals that are more resistant to chemical weathering can survive (e.g. ultrastable minerals [[zircon]], [[tourmaline]] and [[rutile]]). During the transportation, minerals can be sorted by their density, and as a result, light minerals like quartz and mica can be moved faster and further than heavy minerals (like zircon and tourmaline).

== Accumulation of detritus ==

After a certain distance of transportation, detritus reaches a sedimentary basin and accumulates in one place. With the accumulation of sediments, sediments are buried to a deeper level and go through [[diagenesis]], which turns separate sediments into sedimentary rocks (i.e. [[Conglomerate (geology)|conglomerate]], [[sandstone]], [[mudrock]]s, [[limestone]] etc.) and some [[metamorphic rock]]s (such as [[quartzite]]) which were derived from sedimentary rocks. After sediments are weathered and eroded from mountain belts, they can be carried by stream and deposited along rivers as river sands. Detritus can also be transported and deposited in [[foreland basin]]s and at offshore fans. The detrital record can be collected from all these places and can be used in provenance studies.<ref name="Clift 1996"/><ref name="White 2001"/><ref name="Alizai 2011"/>

== Reworking of detritus ==
After detritus are eroded from source area, they are transported and deposited in river, foreland basin or flood plain. Then the detritus can be eroded and transported again when flooding or other kinds of eroding events occur. This process is called as reworking of detritus. And this process could be problematic to provenance studies.<ref name = "Campbell 2005">{{cite journal|last1=Campbell, I. H.|title=He-Pb double dating of detrital zircons from the Ganges and Indus rivers; implication for quantifying sediment recycling and provenance studies|journal=Earth Planet. Sci.

So zircon grains can survive from multiple cycles of reworking. This means if the zircon grain is reworked (re-eroded) from a foreland basin (not from original mountain belt source area) it will lose information of reworking (detrital record will not indicate the foreland basin as a source area but will indicate the earlier mountain belt as a source area). To avoid this problem, samples can be collected close to the mountain front, upstream from which there is no significant sediment storage.<ref name="Alizai 2011">{{cite journal|last1=Alizai,A.|title=Sediment provenance, reworking and transport processes in the Indus River by U–Pb dating of detrital zircon grains|journal=Global and Planetary Change|date=2011|doi=10.1016/j.gloplacha.2010.11.008 |display-authors=etal|volume=76|issue=1–2|pages=33–55|bibcode=2011GPC....76...33A}}</ref>

== Development of provenance methods ==
The study of sedimentary provenance involves several geological disciplines, including [[mineralogy]], [[geochemistry]], geochronology, [[sedimentology]], igneous and metamorphic [[petrology]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Haughton and Morton|chapter=Sedimentary provenance studies|editor1=Morton, A.C. |editor2=Todd, S.P. |editor3=Haughton, P.D.W. |title=Developments in Sedimentary Provenance Studies |date=1991}}</ref> The development of provenance methods are heavily dependent on the development of these mainstream geological disciplines. The earliest provenance studies were primarily based on [[paleocurrent]] analysis and [[petrographic]] analysis (composition and texture of sandstone and conglomerate).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Krumberin and Sloss|title=Stratigraphy and Sedimentology|date=1963|publisher=W.H.Freeman and Co.|edition=2nd}}</ref> Since the 1970s, provenance studies shifted to interpret [[tectonic]] settings (i.e. magmatic arcs, collision orogens and continental blocks) using sandstone composition.<ref name = "Dickinson 1979">{{cite journal

|pages=2164–2182}}</ref> Similarly, bulk rock geochemistry techniques are applied to interpret provenance linking geochemical signatures to source rocks and tectonic settings. Later, with the development of chemical and isotopic micro-analysis methods and geochronological techniques(e.g. [[ICP-MS]], [[SHRIMP]]), provenance researches shifted to analyze single mineral grains. The following table has examples of where provenance study samples are collected.

== Provenance methods ==

Generally, provenance methods can be sorted into two categories, which are petrological methods and geochemical methods. Examples of petrological methods include QFL ternary diagram, [[heavy mineral]] assemblages ([[apatite]]–[[tourmaline]] index, [[garnet]] [[zircon]] index), [[clay mineral]] assemblages and [[illite]] [[crystallinity]], reworked fossils and [[palynomorph]]s, and stock magnetic properties. Examples of geochemical methods include zircon U-Pb dating (plus [[Hafnium|Hf]] isotope), zircon [[fission track]], apatite fission track, bulk sediment Nd and Sr isotopes, garnet chemistry, [[pyroxene]] chemistry, [[amphibole]] chemistry and so on. There is a more detailed list below with references to various types of provenance methods.

== Examples of provenance methods ==

=== Sandstone composition and plate tectonics ===

This method is widely used in provenance studies and it has the ability to link sandstone composition to tectonic setting. This method is described in the Dickinson and Suczek 1979 paper.<ref name = "Dickinson 1979"/> Detrital framework modes of sandstone suites from different kinds of basins are a function of provenance types governed by plate tectonics. (1)[[Quartzose sandstone|Quartzose sand]]s from continental [[cratons]] are widespread within interior basins, platform successions, miogeoclinal wedges, and opening ocean basins. (2)[[Arkosic|Arkosic sand]]s from uplifted basement blocks are present locally in [[Trough (geology)|rift trough]]s and in wrench basins related to transform ruptures. (3)Volcaniclastic [[Lithic fragment (geology)|lithic]] sand and more complex volcano-[[plutonic]] sands derived from [[Forearc|magmatic arc]]s are present in trenches, [[forearc]] basins and [[marginal sea]]s. (4) Recycled [[orogenic]] sands, rich in quartz or [[chert]] plus other lithic fragments and derived from [[Subduction|subduction complexe]]s, collision orogens, and foreland uplifts, are present in closing ocean basins. Triangular diagrams showing framework proportions of quartz, the two feldspars, polycrystalline quartzose lithics, and unstable lithics of volcanic and sedimentary parentage successfully distinguish the key provenance types."<ref name = "Dickinson 1979"/>

The figure to the right is an example of [[uranium–lead dating|U–Pb]] relative age probability diagram.<ref name = "DeCelles 2004"/> The upper plot shows foreland basin detrital zircon age distribution. The lower plot shows hinterland (source area) zircon age distribution. In the plots, n is the number of analyzed zircon grains. So for [[foreland basin]] Amile formation, 74 grains are analyzed. For source area (divided into 3 tectonic level, Tethyan Himalaya, Greater Himalaya and [[Lesser Himalaya]]), 962, 409 and 666 grains are analyzed respectively. To correlate hinterland and foreland data, let's see the source area record first, Tethyan sequence have age peak at ~500 Myr, 1000 Myr and 2600 Myr, Greater Himalaya has age peaks at ~1200 Myr and 2500 Myr, and Lesser Himalaya sequence has age peaks at ~1800 Ma and 2600 Ma. By simply comparing the foreland basin record with source area record, we cam see that Amile formation resemble age distribution of Lesser Himalaya. It has about 20 grains with age ~1800 Myr ([[Paleoproterozoic]]) and about 16 grains yield age of ~2600 Myr ([[Archean]]). Then we can interpret that sediments of Amile formation are mainly derived from the Lesser Himalaya, and rocks yield ago of Paleoproterozoic and Archean are from the [[Indian craton]]. So the story is: Indian plate collide with Tibet, rocks of Indian craton deformed and involved into Himalayan thrust belt (e.g. Lesser Himalaya sequence), then eroded and deposited at foreland basin.

U–Pb geochronology of zircons was conducted by laser ablation multicollector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry ([[ICPMS|LA-MC-ICPMS]]).

== Lab data acquisition and instruments ==
[[File:SHRIP II.JPG|thumbnail|left|Sensitive High Resolution Ion Microprobe (SHRIMP II) at Curtin University, Western Australia]]
To pick suitable lab data acquisition to sediment provenance, grain size should be taken into consideration. For conglomerates and boulders, as original mineral [[paragenesis]] is preserved, almost all analytical methods can be used to study the provenance.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Cuthbert, S.J.|title=Evolution of the Devonian Hornelen basin, west Norway: new constraints from petrological studies of metamorphic clasts. In: Morton, A.C., Todd, S.P., Haughton, P.D.W. (Eds.), Developments in Sedimentary Provenance Studies|journal=Geological Society, London, Special Publications|date=1991|doi=10.1144/gsl.sp.1991.057.01.25|volume=57|pages=343–360|s2cid=131524673}}</ref> For finer grained sediments, as they always lose paragenetic information, only a limited range of analytical methods can be used.

Lab data acquisition approaches for provenance study fall into the following three categories: (1) analyzing bulk composition to extract petrographic, mineralogical and chemical information. (2) analyzing specific groups of minerals such as heavy minerals and (3) analyzing single mineral grains about morphological, chemical and isotopic properties.

For bulk composition analysis, samples are crushed, powdered and disintegrated or melted. Then measurement of major and trace and rare-earth (REE) elements are conducted by using instruments like [[atomic absorption spectroscopy]] (AAS), [[X-ray fluorescence]](XRF), [[neutron activation analysis]] (NAA) etc.

Sand-sized sediments are able to be analyzed by single-grain methods. Single-grain methods can be divided into the following three groups: (1) Microscopic-morphological techniques, which are used to observe shape, color and internal structures in minerals. For example, scanning electron microscope (SEM) and cathodoluminescence (CL) detector.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lihou, J.C., Mange-Rajetzky, M.A.|title=Provenance of the Sardona flysch, eastern Swiss Alps: example of high-resolution heavy mineral analysis applied to an ultrastable assemblage.

== Problems and limitations of provenance studies ==
[[File:Source to basin.png|thumb|upright=1.2|Main steps (middle), modification processes (right) and controlling factors (left) of sediment evolution.]]
During the pathway of detritus transported from source area to basin, the detritus is subject to weathering, transporting, mixing, deposition, diagenesis and recycling. The complicated process can modify parents lithology both compositionally and textually. All these factors pose certain limits on our capability to restore the characteristics of source rocks from the properties of the produced detrital record. The following paragraphs briefly introduce major problems and limitations of provenance studies.<ref name="JohnssonBasu1993">{{cite book|author1=Mark J. Johnsson|author2=Abhijit Basu|title=Processes Controlling the Composition of Clastic Sediments|date=1 January 1993|publisher=Geological Society of America|isbn=978-0-8137-2284-9}}</ref>

=== Candidate source area ===
To correlate sediments (detrital record) to source area, several possible source area need to be chosen for comparison. In this process, possible source area where sediment is from may be missed and not chosen as a candidate source area. This could cause misinterpretation in correlation sediment to source later.

=== Grain size ===
Grain size could cause misinterpretation of provenance studies. During transportation and deposition, detritus is subject to mechanical breakdown, chemical alternation and sorting. This always results in a preferential enrichment of specific materials in a certain range of grain-size, and sediment composition tends to be a function of grain size. For instance, SiO<sub>2</sub>/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> ratios decrease with decreasing of grain size because Al-rich phyllosilicate enriches at the expense of Si-rich phase in fine-grained detritus. This means the changing of composition of detrital record could reflect effect of sorting of grain size and not only changing of provenance.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Ingersoll|title=The effect of grain size on detrital mode: a test of the Gazzi-Dickinson point-counting method|journal=Journal of Sedimentary Petrology|date=1984|display-authors=etal}}</ref> To minimize the influence of sedimentary sorting on provenance method (like Sr-Nd isotopic method), only very fine-grained to fine-grained sandstones are collected as samples but medium-grained sandstones can be used when alternatives are unavailable.<ref name ="Najman 2000">{{cite journal|last1=Najman |display-authors=etal |title=Early Himalayan exhumation: Isotopic constraints from the Indian foreland basin|journal=Terra Nova|date=2000|doi=10.1046/j.1365-3121.2000.00268.x|volume=12|issue=1 |pages=28–34|bibcode=2000TeNov..12...28N |s2cid=128422705 }}</ref>

=== Mixing of detritus ===
Mixing of detritus from multiple sources may cause problems with correlating the final detrital record to source rocks, especially when dispersal pathways are complex and involve recycling of previously deposited sediments. For example, if a detrital record contains zircon grains with an age of one billion years that were transported by rivers flowing through two source areas containing zircons which are also one billion years old, it would not be possible to determine which of the two upstream source areas was the source of the zircon detritus, based on age alone.

=== Diagenesis ===
Diagenesis could be a problem when analyzing detrital records especially when dealing with ancient sediments which are always lithified.<ref name = "Giles 1997"/> Variation of clay minerals in detrital record may not reflect variation of provenance rock, but burial effect. For example, clay minerals become unstable at great depth, kaolinite and smectite become illte. If there is a downward increasing trend of illite components in a drilling core, we can not conclude that early detrital record indicate more illite-yield source rock but possibly as a result of burial and alternation of minerals<ref name= "Giles 1997">{{cite book|last1=Giles, M. R.|title=Diagenesis: A Quantitative Perspective— Implications for Basin Modelling and Rock Property Prediction|publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers|date=1997|isbn=9780792348146}}</ref>

=== Hinterland structural assumption ===
[[File:Structural assumption.png|thumb|upright=1.5|left|Structural assumption influence on provenance interpretation, left two cross sections are two hinterland structural assumptions and the right column is a foreland basin stratigraphy which shows variations of detrital record. Ma = Million year]]
As a provenance study tries to correlate detrital record (which is stored in basins) to hinterland [[stratigraphy]], and hinterland stratigraphy is structurally controlled by fault systems, so hinterland structural setting is important to interpretation of the detrital record. Hinterland structural setting is estimated by field mapping work. Geologists work along river valleys and traverse mountain belts (thrust belt), locate major faults and describe major stratigraphy bounded by faults in the area. A geologic map is the product of field mapping work, and cross sections can be constructed by interpreting a geologic map. However, a lot of assumptions are made during this process, so the hinterland structural settings are always assumptions. And these assumptions can affect interpretation of detrital record. Here is an example, the right figure shows a classic thrust belt and foreland basin system, the thrust fault carries overlying rocks to the surface and rocks of various [[lithology]] are eroded and transported to deposit at the foreland basin. In structural assumption 1, the pink layer is assumed to exist above thrust 2 and thrust 3, but in the 2nd assumption, the pink layer is only carried by thrust 2. Detrital records are stored in foreland basin stratigraphy. Within the stratigraphy, the pink layer is correlated to the hinterland pink layer. If we use structural assumption 2, we can interpret that thrust 2 was active about 12 and 5 million years ago. But when using the other assumption, we couldn't know if the pink layer record indicates activity of thrust 2 or 3.

A combination usage of multiple provenance methods (e.g.[[petrography]], [[heavy mineral analysis]], mineral geochemistry, wholerock geochemistry, geochronology and drainage capture analysis)can provide valuable insights to all stages of [[hydrocarbon]] exploration and production.<ref name = "Smyth 2012">{{cite journal|last1=Smyth |first=H. |title=Sediment provenance studies in hydrocarbon exploration and production: an introduction|journal=Geological Society, London, Special Publications |date=2012|display-authors=etal|doi=10.1144/sp386.21|volume=386|pages=1–6|s2cid=130238928 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|first1=R.

For example, they are used to assess permeability variations and well decline rate resulting from spatial variability in [[diagenesis]] and depositional facies <ref name = "Smyth 2012"/>
