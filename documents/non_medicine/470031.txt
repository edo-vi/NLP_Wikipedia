== Etymology and usage ==
The word ''anecdote'' (in [[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: ἀνέκδοτον "unpublished", literally "not given out") comes from [[Procopius of Caesarea]], the biographer of Emperor [[Justinian I]] ({{reign | 527 | 565}}). Procopius produced {{circa | 550 CE}} a work entitled {{lang|grc|Ἀνέκδοτα}} (''Anekdota'', variously translated as ''Unpublished Memoirs'' or as ''Secret History''), which consists primarily of a collection of short incidents from the private life of the [[Byzantine Empire| Byzantine]] court. Gradually, the term "anecdote" came to be applied<ref>Its first appearance in English is of 1676 (''[[OED]]'').</ref> to any short tale used to emphasize or illustrate whatever point an author wished to make. In the context of Greek, [[Estonian language| Estonian]], [[Lithuanian language| Lithuanian]], [[Bulgarian language| Bulgarian]] and [[Russian humor]], an anecdote refers to any short humorous story without the need of factual or biographical origins.

== As evidence ==
{{Main|Anecdotal evidence}}

Anecdotal evidence is an informal account of [[evidence]] in the form of an anecdote. The term is often used in contrast to [[scientific evidence]], as evidence that cannot be investigated using the [[scientific method]]. The problem with arguing based on anecdotal evidence is that anecdotal evidence is not necessarily typical; only statistical evidence can determine how typical something is. Misuse of anecdotal evidence is an [[informal fallacy]].

When used in [[advertising]] or promotion of a product, service, or idea, anecdotal evidence is often called a [[testimonial]]. The term is also sometimes used in a legal context to describe certain kinds of testimony. [[Psychologist]]s have found that people are more likely to remember notable examples than the typical example.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Graesser |first1=A.C. |last2=Hauft-Smith |first2=K. |last3=Cohen |first3=A.D. |last4=Pyles |first4=L.D. |title=Structural Components of Reading Time |journal=Journal of Verbal Learning and Verbal Behavior |date=1980 |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=135–51|doi=10.1016/S0022-5371(80)90132-2 }}</ref>
