A '''marker vaccine''' is a [[vaccine]] which allows for immunological differentiation (or segregation) of [[Viral disease|infected]] from vaccinated animals, and is also referred to as a [[Vaccine#DIVA vaccines|DIVA]] (or SIVA) vaccine [Differentiation (or Segregation) of infected from vaccinated animals] in [[veterinary medicine]].<ref>{{Cite journal| issn = 0022-1317| volume = 67| pages = 1179–1182| last1 = van Oirschot| first1 = J.

In contrast, vaccination with traditional vaccines containing the complete pathogen, either [[Attenuated vaccine|attenuated]] or [[Inactivated vaccine|inactivated]], precludes the use of [[serology]] (e.g. analysis of specific [[antibodies]] in body fluids) in epidemiological surveys in vaccinated populations.{{cn|date=March 2022}}

Apart from the obvious advantage of allowing continued serological monitoring of vaccinated individuals, cohorts or populations; the serological difference between vaccinated individuals and individuals that were exposed to the pathogen, and were [[Contagious disease|contagious]], can be used to continuously monitor the [[efficacy]] and [[safety]] of the vaccine.<ref>{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0100392| issn = 1932-6203| volume = 9| issue = 6| pages = –100392| last1 = Blodörn| first1 = Krister| last2 = Hägglund| first2 = Sara| last3 = Fix| first3 = Jenna| last4 = Dubuquoy| first4 = Catherine| last5 = Makabi-Panzu| first5 = Boby| last6 = Thom| first6 = Michelle| last7 = Karlsson| first7 = Per| last8 = Roque| first8 = Jean-Louis| last9 = Karlstam| first9 = Erika| last10 = Pringle| first10 = John| last11 = Eléouët| first11 = Jean-François| last12 = Riffault| first12 = Sabine| last13 = Taylor| first13 = Geraldine| last14 = Valarcher| first14 = Jean François| title = Vaccine Safety and Efficacy Evaluation of a Recombinant Bovine Respiratory Syncytial Virus (BRSV) with Deletion of the SH Gene and Subunit Vaccines Based On Recombinant Human RSV Proteins: N-nanorings, P and M2-1, in Calves with Maternal Antibodies| journal = PLOS ONE| date = 2014| pmid = 24945377| pmc=4063758| bibcode = 2014PLoSO...9j0392B| doi-access = free}}</ref>
