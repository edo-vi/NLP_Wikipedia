A '''hypotonic-hyporesponsive episode''' (HHE) is defined as sudden onset of [[hypotonia|poor muscle tone]], [[hyporesponsiveness|reduced consciousness]], and [[pallor|pale]] or [[cyanosis|bluish skin]] occurring within 48 hours after [[vaccination]], most commonly [[pertussis vaccination]].<ref name="aappublications">{{cite journal|url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/106/4/e52|title=Hypotonic–Hyporesponsive Episodes Reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), 1996–1998 &#124; ELECTRONIC ARTICLE|journal=Pediatrics|date=October 2000|volume=106|issue=4|pages=e52|accessdate=2018-01-22|last1=Duvernoy|first1=Tracy S.|last2=Braun|first2=M.
