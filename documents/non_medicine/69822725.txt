'''Global paleoclimate''' indicators are the proxies sensitive to global [[Paleoclimatology|paleoclimatic]] environment changes. They are mostly derived from [[Marine sediment|marine sediments]]. Paleoclimate indicators derived from terrestrial sediments, on the other hand, are commonly influenced by local [[Plate tectonics|tectonic movements]] and [[Palaeogeography|paleogeographic]] variations. Factors governing the earth climate system include plate tectonics, which controls the configuration of continents, the interplay between the atmosphere and the ocean, and the earth's orbital characteristics ([[Milankovitch cycles]]). Global paleoclimate indicators are established based on the information extracted from the analyses of geologic materials, including [[biological]], [[Geochemistry|geochemical]] and [[Mineralogy|mineralogical]] data preserved in marine sediments. Indicators are generally grouped into three categories; [[Paleontology|paleontological]], geochemical and [[Lithology|lithological]].

== Paleontological indicators ==
Sedimentary records are influenced by local [[topography]] and oceanic and atmospheric currents. Proxies of global climatic significance are, however, less ambiguous in [[paleotemperature]] interpretation. Marine biota have offered by far the most proxies for paleotemperature, of which the microfossils, because of their widespread, abundance and sensitive to latitudinal changes, have provided many primary important paleotemperature indicators. Identification of latitudinal indices species is usually the first attempt to tie their presence in sediments to paleotemperature fluctuations. Other properties of marine biota, including morphology, abundance, diversity, and geochemistry have also been successfully established as paleoclimate indicators. More complex statistical analyses ([[factor analysis]], [[principal component]], etc.) of biogeography have been able to link fauna assemblages to water masses for paleo-current reconstruction. List below are some key paleontological tools utilized by scientists to reconstruct paleotemperature history.{{citation needed|date=January 2022}}

=== Foraminferals ===
Because of their widespread distribution and abundance in sediments, [[Foraminifera|forams]] have been the most extensively explored for their biological characters linked to paleoclimatic and paleoecologic reconstructions. Numerous reports have documented both [[Plankton|planktonic]] and benthic forams as proxies for paleotemperature. These include the studies of morphological and biogeographical responses to surface temperature.{{citation needed|date=January 2022}}

==== Morphology ====
===== Size =====
Investigations of planktonic foraminiferal population indicate that tropical species attain their largest test sizes in tropical waters, and polar species reach maximum sizes in polar waters.

==== Species diversity ====
Planktonic foraminiferal species diversity depends on available [[Ecological niche|niches]], which are in turn related to [[Ocean current|ocean circulation]]. By correlation with stable isotope records, maximum diversity has been found to occur after the initiation of a glaciation period.<ref name="Ottens">{{cite journal |last1=Ottens |first1=Janneke J. |last2=Nederbragt |first2=Alexandra J. |title=Planktic foraminiferal diversity as indicator of ocean environments |journal=Marine Micropaleontology |date=April 1992 |volume=19 |issue=1–2 |pages=13–28 |doi=10.1016/0377-8398(92)90019-G |bibcode=1992MarMP..19...13O }}</ref>

==== [[Biogeography]] ====
Since the deep sea cores became available in the 1960s, paleoclimatic indices of planktonic foraminifera from marine sediments have been used for paleoclimatic reconstruction. Among the early pioneers to apply foraminifera latitudinal abundances, Ericson and Wollin (1968) succeeded in establishing the [[Pleistocene]] glacial and [[interglacial]] cycles based on the ratios of cold and warm water species in tropical sediments.<ref name="ERICSON">{{cite journal |last1=Ericson |first1=David B. |last2=Wollin |first2=Goesta |title=Pleistocene Climates and Chronology in Deep-Sea Sediments: Magnetic reversals give a time scale of 2 million years for a complete Pleistocene with four glaciations. |journal=Science |date=13 December 1968 |volume=162 |issue=3859 |pages=1227–1234 |doi=10.1126/science.162.3859.1227 |pmid=17756330 }}</ref> Similar work was extended to subantarctic region by Kennett (1970), who, based on subpolar cold and warm water planktonic foraminferal species, reconstructed paleoclimatic changes in the Pleistocene, consistent in trends with those established in the tropical region.<ref name="Kennett">{{cite journal |last1=Kennett |first1=James P. |title=Pleistocene paleoclimates and foraminiferal biostratigraphy in subantarctic deep-sea cores |journal=Deep Sea Research and Oceanographic Abstracts |date=February 1970 |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=125–140 |doi=10.1016/0011-7471(70)90092-6 |bibcode=1970DSRA...17..125K }}</ref>

When drilling cores, which recovered longer sediment columns than piston cores, came along, paleoclimatic reconstruction investigations were pushed back further in geological times. A climatic curve in the [[Oligocene]] was constructed in the Gulf of Mexico by using warm water indicators (Turborotalia pseudoampliapertura, Globoquadrina tripartita, Dentoglobigerina globularis, Dentoglobigerina baroemoenensis, “Globigerina” ciperoensis and Globigerinoides groups, and Cassigerinella chipolensis) and cold water indicators (Catapsydrax spp., Globorotaloides spp., Subbotina angiporoides group, Globigerina s. str., and the tenuitellids).<ref name="Spezzaferri1">{{cite journal |last1=Spezzaferri |first1=Silvia |last2=Premoli Silva |first2=Isabella |title=Oligocene planktonic foraminiferal biostratigraphy and paleoclimatic interpretation from Hole 538A, DSDP Leg 77, Gulf of Mexico |journal=Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology |date=February 1991 |volume=83 |issue=1–3 |pages=217–263 |doi=10.1016/0031-0182(91)90080-B |bibcode=1991PPP....83..217S }}</ref> A more extensive geographic coverage was investigated by Spezzaferri in 1995, who analyzed samples from drilling cores in the Atlantic, Indian and South Pacific Oceans and identified and grouped foraminifera into warmer, cooler, warm-temperate and cool-temperate indices. A paleoclimatic curve in the Oligocene and Miocene transition period was established and the curve was supported by the isotope data.<ref name="Spezzaferri">{{cite journal |last1=Spezzaferri |first1=Silvia |title=Planktonic foraminiferal paleoclimatic implications across the Oligocene-Miocene transition in the oceanic record (Atlantic, Indian and South Pacific) |journal=Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology |date=March 1995 |volume=114 |issue=1 |pages=43–74 |doi=10.1016/0031-0182(95)00076-X |bibcode=1995PPP...114...43S }}</ref>

A more sophisticated approach to reconstruct paleoclimate involves using factor analysis. Thompson (1981) was able to relate six foraminiferal assemblages from core top samples to present water masses in the western North Pacific. A transfer function was generated to link the assemblages to sea surface temperatures. A paleotemperature curve for the past 150,000 years was reconstructed by applying this transfer function to old sediments in the cores.<ref name="Thompson1">{{cite journal |last1=Thompson |first1=Peter R. |title=Planktonic foraminifera in the Western North Pacific during the past 150 000 years: Comparison of modern and fossil assemblages |journal=Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology |date=1981 |volume=35 |pages=241–279 |doi=10.1016/0031-0182(81)90099-7 |bibcode=1981PPP....35..241T }}</ref>

Similar technique has been applied to the Eocene and Oligocene sediments and the forams have been categorized in surface, intermediate and deep water-mass groups. Thus water-mass stratification, in addition to paleotemperature fluctuation has been reconstructed.<ref name="Keller">{{cite journal |last1=Keller |first1=Gerta |title=Paleoclimatic analyses of middle Eocene through Oligocene planktic foraminiferal faunas |journal=Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology |date=August 1983 |volume=43 |issue=1–2 |pages=73–94 |doi=10.1016/0031-0182(83)90049-4 |bibcode=1983PPP....43...73K }}</ref>

===Coccolith===

A 15-degree of latitude shift has been noted for the distribution of some selected species of [[Coccoliths]] between recent sediments and mid-Wisconsin glacier sediments of the North Atlantic.<ref name="Mcintyre">{{cite journal |last1=McIntyre |first1=Andrew |title=Coccoliths as Paleoclimatic Indicators of Pleistocene Glaciation |journal=Science |date=8 December 1967 |volume=158 |issue=3806 |pages=1314–1317 |doi=10.1126/science.158.3806.1314 |pmid=17801859 |bibcode=1967Sci...158.1314M |s2cid=29899719 }}</ref> Concentrations of coccoliths in marine sediments appear to be related to surface temperatures as well. This is demonstrated by the quantitative analysis of coccolith assemblages in the western Mediterranean Pleistocene sediments.<ref name="Flores">{{cite journal |last1=Flores |first1=J.

===Radiolarians===

Because of their resistant to cold water dissolution, which severely destroys the calcareous planktonic fossils at depth worldwide, [[Radiolarians]] has become one of the most commonly studied siliceous planktonic fossils for paleotemperature reconstruction. 
Study of Radiolarians in the North Pacific deep sea cores has revealed that increases in both species diversity and abundance correspond to major glaciation events of the last 16 million years. Changes in Radiolarian compositions are also evident to reflect in general sea surface temperature.<ref name="Kamikuri">{{cite journal |last1=Kamikuri |first1=Shin-ichi |last2=Nishi |first2=Hiroshi |last3=Motoyama |first3=Isao |title=Effects of late Neogene climatic cooling on North Pacific radiolarian assemblages and oceanographic conditions |journal=Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology |date=June 2007 |volume=249 |issue=3–4 |pages=370–392 |doi=10.1016/j.palaeo.2007.02.008 |bibcode=2007PPP...249..370K }}</ref>

By applying statistical analyses (Q-mode factor analysis), many quantitative studies of Radiolarian assemblages from surface sediments have established a transfer function which enables the estimation of paleo-sea surface temperature. For example, Pisias et al. (1997) were able to identify assemblages representative to the present Pacific biogeography and used these assemblages to predict sea surface temperature of the last glacier maximum.<ref name="Pisias">{{cite journal |last1=Pisias |first1=Nicklas G. |last2=Roelofs |first2=Adrienne |last3=Weber |first3=Mysti |title=Radiolarian-based transfer functions for estimating mean surface ocean temperatures and seasonal range |journal=Paleoceanography |date=June 1997 |volume=12 |issue=3 |pages=365–379 |doi=10.1029/97PA00582 |bibcode=1997PalOc..12..365P }}</ref>

===Diatoms===

[[Diatom]] species in polar and subpolar marine environments commonly display a narrow range of ecological preferences, in terms of sea surface temperature and sea ice conditions. An established relationship between diatom assemblages and their ecological preferences in surface sediments, could, therefore, be applied to sediments below the surface. For example, statistical analyses of diatom in the Antarctic Peninsula surface sediments have established diatom assemblages indicative to sea ice and open marine conditions, and these assemblages have been used as proxies for glacial and interglacial stages respectively in the Holocene sediments.<ref name="Taylor">{{cite journal |last1=Taylor |first1=F |last2=Whitehead |first2=J |last3=Domack |first3=E |title=Holocene paleoclimate change in the Antarctic Peninsula: evidence from the diatom, sedimentary and geochemical record |journal=Marine Micropaleontology |date=February 2001 |volume=41 |issue=1–2 |pages=25–43 |doi=10.1016/S0377-8398(00)00049-9 |bibcode=2001MarMP..41...25T }}</ref>

Diatom studies of lacustrine sediments in Siberia and Mongolia demonstrate a close relationship during the last glacial maximum between planktonic diatom diversity and paleoclimate through the correlation with oxygen isotope records, which represent global ice volume changes.<ref name="Karabanov">{{cite journal |last1=Karabanov |first1=Eugene |last2=Williams |first2=Douglas |last3=Kuzmin |first3=Mikhail |last4=Sideleva |first4=Valentina |last5=Khursevich |first5=Galina |last6=Prokopenko |first6=Alexander |last7=Solotchina |first7=Emilia |last8=Tkachenko |first8=Lilia |last9=Fedenya |first9=Svetlana |last10=Kerber |first10=Eugene |last11=Gvozdkov |first11=Alexander |last12=Khlustov |first12=Oleg |last13=Bezrukova |first13=Elena |last14=Letunova |first14=Polina |last15=Krapivina |first15=Svetlana |title=Ecological collapse of Lake Baikal and Lake Hovsgol ecosystems during the Last Glacial and consequences for aquatic species diversity |journal=Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology |date=July 2004 |volume=209 |issue=1–4 |pages=227–243 |doi=10.1016/j.palaeo.2004.02.017 |bibcode=2004PPP...209..227K }}</ref>

===Dinoflagellates===

Investigation on [[dinoflagellate]] cyst in the Mediterranean Sea has identified warm and cold temperate [[dinocyst]] species and these species have been used to reconstruct the paleoclimate changes during the past 30,000 years.<ref name="Rouis">{{cite journal |last1=Rouis-Zargouni |first1=Imene |last2=Turon |first2=Jean-Louis |last3=Londeix |first3=Laurent |last4=Essallami |first4=Latifa |last5=Kallel |first5=Néjib |last6=Sicre |first6=Marie-Alexandrine |title=Environmental and climatic changes in the central Mediterranean Sea (Siculo–Tunisian Strait) during the last 30ka based on dinoflagellate cyst and planktonic foraminifera assemblages |journal=Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology |date=January 2010 |volume=285 |issue=1–2 |pages=17–29 |doi=10.1016/j.palaeo.2009.10.015 |bibcode=2010PPP...285...17R }}</ref>

=== Ostracods ===

Using [[ostracod]] crustaceans as palaeoclimate proxies has been well established for the Quaternary. Not only their indicator species, but also the trace element and stable isotope geochemistry of their shells have been documented as evidence of past climate fluctuations.<ref name="Horne">{{cite book |doi=10.1016/B978-0-444-53636-5.00018-4 |title=Ostracoda as Proxies for Quaternary Climate Change |series=Developments in Quaternary Sciences |year=2012 |last1=Horne |first1=David J. |last2=Holmes |first2=Jonathan A. |last3=Rodriguez-Lazaro |first3=Julio |last4=Viehberg |first4=Finn A. |volume=17 |pages=305–315 |isbn=978-0-444-53636-5 }}</ref>

== Geochemical Indicators ==
=== Isotope ===
==== Oxygen ====
Its isotope fractionation is linked to water temperature and its isotope ratios from a variety of sources have been widely used to reconstruct paleoclimate. [[Oxygen isotope]] in calcium carbonates has become the most widely applied as geothermometer for estimating ancient ocean temperatures. The most successful applications of isotope paleoclimatology have been the study of foraminifera from deep-sea sediments. For instance, Shackleton and Kennett (1975) have established the Cenozoic paleotemperature history based on analyzing oxygen isotope composition of both planktonic and benthic foraminifera in the Antarctic region.<ref name="Shackleton">{{cite book |doi=10.2973/dsdp.proc.29.117.1975 |chapter=Paleotemperature History of the Cenozoic and the Initiation of Antarctic Glaciation: Oxygen and Carbon Isotope Analyses in DSDP Sites 277, 279 and 281 |title=Initial Reports of the Deep Sea Drilling Project, 29 |series=Initial Reports of the Deep Sea Drilling Project |year=1975 |last1=Shackleton |first1=N.J. |last2=Kennett |first2=J.P. |volume=29 }}</ref> Since the variations in the 18O/16O ratio in marine fossil records are global, the oxygen isotope stratigraphy has been used for chronological correlation.<ref name="Grossman">{{cite book |doi=10.1016/B978-0-12-824360-2.00010-3 |chapter=Oxygen Isotope Stratigraphy |title=Geologic Time Scale 2020 |year=2020 |last1=Grossman |first1=E.L. |last2=Joachimski |first2=M.M. |pages=279–307 |isbn=978-0-12-824360-2 |s2cid=241419002 }}</ref>

==== Carbon ====
Stable carbon isotope composition is another widely used proxy for interpreting paleoenvironment conditions. The Surface temperature fluctuation from the Paleocene to Miocene has been established based on [[carbon isotope]] data from foraminifera in Antarctic region.<ref name="Shackleton"/> The organic matter preserved in sediments records paleoecosystems, and its carbon isotope composition has been also utilized to reconstruct paleoclimatic evolution. For example, Rogers and Koons (1969) have reported that the carbon isotope ratios, derived from organic matter in Quaternary marine sediments in the Gulf of Mexico, correlate well with Pleistocene climate changes.<ref name="Rogers">{{cite journal |last1=Rogers |first1=M.

Lipid:In marine sediments, a stable lipid called IP25 (Ice Proxy with 25 carbon atoms), which is biosynthesized by sea-ice dwelling diatom, has been found to be generally related to spring sea-ice cover in the Arctic region, Thus this proxy could be used to reconstruct sea-ice coverage.<ref name="Stoynova">{{cite journal |last1=Stoynova |first1=Vera |last2=Shanahan |first2=Timothy M. |last3=Hughen |first3=Konrad A. |last4=de Vernal |first4=Anne |title=Insights into Circum-Arctic sea ice variability from molecular geochemistry |journal=Quaternary Science Reviews |date=November 2013 |volume=79 |pages=63–73 |doi=10.1016/j.quascirev.2012.10.006 |bibcode=2013QSRv...79...63S }}</ref> A different biomarker, IPSO25 (Ice Proxy Southern Ocean with 25 carbon atoms) has been documented as a useful proxy for the sea-ice cover in the Antarctic region.<ref name="Lamping">{{cite journal |last1=Lamping |first1=Nele |last2=Müller |first2=Juliane |last3=Hefter |first3=Jens |last4=Mollenhauer |first4=Gesine |last5=Haas |first5=Christian |last6=Shi |first6=Xiaoxu |last7=Vorrath |first7=Maria-Elena |last8=Lohmann |first8=Gerrit |last9=Hillenbrand |first9=Claus-Dieter |title=Evaluation of lipid biomarkers as proxies for sea ice and ocean temperatures along the Antarctic continental margin |journal=Climate of the Past |date=29 October 2021 |volume=17 |issue=5 |pages=2305–2326 |doi=10.5194/cp-17-2305-2021 |bibcode=2021CliPa..17.2305L |s2cid=240248345 |url=http://nora.nerc.ac.uk/id/eprint/531332/1/cp-17-2305-2021.pdf }}</ref>

== Lithological indicators ==

=== Ice-rafted debris ===
Among all the lithological indicators, [[ice-rafted debris]] (IRD) is the most useful tool to reconstruct paleoclimate. High concentrations of IRD evidence the glacial intervals during which icebergs likely traveled far from Polar Regions。In the South Pacific, IRD has been used as proxy for glaciation in the Cenozoic and a glaciation history has been established for the Subantarctic region.

In the western Arctic Ocean, investigation of ice-rafted debris has identified at least six glacial intervals in the last 1 million years.

=== Marine carbonates ===
Carbonate in marine sediments predominantly comes from calcifying organisms, with a minor contribution from diagenesis and precipitation. Biogenic calcium carbonate has two polymorphs; calcite by foraminifera and coccolith and aragonite by corals and pteropods. While the distribution of foraminifera is generally global, that of corals is subtropical to tropical. Hence the distribution of fossil corals is commonly used as proxy for paleolatitudes. Kiessling et al. (1999) have compiled a database for the “Phanerozoic reefs” including their paleopostions for paleoclimatological reconstructions <ref name="Kiessling">{{cite journal |last1=Wolfgang Kiessling |first1=Erik Flügel |last2=Golonka |first2=Jan |title=Paleoreef Maps: Evaluation of a Comprehensive Database on Phanerozoic Reefs |journal=AAPG Bulletin |date=1999 |volume=83 |issue=10 |pages=1552–1587 |url=https://archives.datapages.com/data/bulletns/1999/10oct/1552/1552.htm }}</ref> Maillet et al.

=== Oolitic limestone ===

Marine carbonate ooids are formed in warm, supersaturated, shallow, highly agitated marine water intertidal environments, and their presence in geological records provides a key role in paleoclimatic and paleogeographic reconstructions. Huang et al. (2017), for example, based on the distribution of Permian ooids and glaciomarine diamictites, have repositioned the Baoshan Block in southwestern China, with respect to other Gondwana continents.<ref name="Huang">{{cite journal |last1=Huang |first1=Hao |last2=Jin |first2=Xiaochi |last3=Li |first3=Fei |last4=Shen |first4=Yang |title=Permian oolitic carbonates from the Baoshan Block in western Yunnan, China, and their paleoclimatic and paleogeographic significance |journal=International Journal of Earth Sciences |date=June 2017 |volume=106 |issue=4 |pages=1341–1358 |doi=10.1007/s00531-016-1400-6 |bibcode=2017IJEaS.106.1341H |s2cid=133150093 }}</ref>
