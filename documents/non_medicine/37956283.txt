==History==
The WI-38 cell line stemmed from earlier work by Hayflick growing human cell cultures.<ref name="Hayflick1961" />

In the early 1960s, Hayflick and his colleague Paul Moorhead at the [[Wistar Institute]] in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]] discovered that when normal human cells were stored in a freezer, the cells remembered the doubling level at which they were stored and, when reconstituted, began to divide from that level to roughly 50 total doublings (for cells derived from fetal tissue). Hayflick determined that normal cells gradually experience signs of [[senescence]] as they divide, first slowing before stopping division altogether.<ref name="Hayflick1961" /><ref name="Hayflick1965" /> This finding is the basis for the [[Hayflick limit]], which specifies the number of times a normal human cell population will divide before [[cell division]] stops.<ref name="Shay2000">{{cite journal | vauthors = Shay JW, Wright WE | title = Hayflick, his limit, and cellular ageing | journal = Nature Reviews.

During this period of research, Hayflick also discovered that if cells were properly stored in a freezer, cells would remain viable and that an enormous number of cells could be produced from a single starting culture. One of the cell strains that Hayflick isolated, which he named WI-38, was found to be free of contaminating viruses, unlike the primary monkey kidney cells then in use for virus vaccine production.<ref name="Hayflick1965" /> In addition, WI-38 cells could be frozen, then thawed and exhaustively tested. These advantages led to WI-38 quickly replacing primary monkey kidney cells for human virus vaccine production.<ref name="Olshansky2017" /><ref name="Nature" /><ref name="Hayflick2018" /> WI-38 has also been used for research on numerous aspects of normal human cell biology.<ref name="Nature" /><ref name="Shay2000" /><ref name=Hayflick2018>{{cite web| vauthors = Hayflick L |title=Errors in the "Vaccine Race" Book |url= http://www.AgingInterventionFoundation.org/BookReview2.pdf }}</ref>

==Applications==
WI-38 was invaluable to early researchers, especially those studying virology and immunology, since it was a readily available cell line of normal human tissue. Unlike the [[HeLa cells|HeLa cell line]], which were cancerous cells, WI-38 was a normal human cell population. Researchers in labs across the globe have since used WI-38 in their discoveries, most notably Hayflick in his development of human virus vaccines.<ref name="Olshansky2017" /> Infected WI-38 cells secrete the virus, and can be cultured in large volumes suitable for commercial production.<ref name="Hayflick1961" />

Virus vaccines produced in WI-38 have prevented disease or saved the lives of billions of people.<ref name="Olshansky2017" /><ref name="Nature" /> Vaccines produced in WI-38 include those made against [[adenoviruses]], [[Rubella virus|rubella]], [[Measles virus|measles]], [[Mumps virus|mumps]], [[Varicella zoster virus|varicella zoster]], [[poliovirus]], [[Hepatitis A virus|hepatitis A]] and [[Rabies virus|rabies]].<ref name="Fletcher1998" /><ref name="Olshansky2017" /><ref name="Nature" /><ref name="Hayflick2018" />

== Genome sequence ==
The WI-38 cell line was one of the first cell lines whose ''diploid'' genome was sequenced.<ref name=":1">{{cite journal | vauthors = Soifer L, Fong NL, Yi N, Ireland AT, Lam I, Sooknah M, Paw JS, Peluso P, Concepcion GT, Rank D, Hastie AR, Jojic V, Ruby JG, Botstein D, Roy MA | display-authors = 6 | title = Fully Phased Sequence of a Diploid Human Genome Determined ''de Novo'' from the DNA of a Single Individual | journal = G3 | volume = 10 | issue = 9 | pages = 2911–2925 | date = September 2020 | pmid = 32631951 | pmc = 7466960 | doi = 10.1534/g3.119.400995 }}</ref> This is critical because most human genome sequences have not been resolved to [[chromosome]] level, that is, it remained largely unclear which genetic variant is on which of the two [[chromatid]]s. Besides being an important cell line for experimental studies (e.g. on aging), the WI-38 line is believed to have remained [[Ploidy|diploid]] since it was originally established in 1961. Nearly 60 years later, [[Karyotype|karyotyping]] by Soifer et al. (2020) showed that the WI-38 genome has not acquired major rearrangements such as [[Chromosomal translocation|translocations]]. More importantly, the de novo phased assembly confirms that the genome has in fact remained diploid and retained its [[Zygosity|heterozygosity]] throughout. It is therefore a good model for genome sequencing and serves as another reference genome.<ref name=":1" />
