A '''cycler''' is a potential spacecraft on a closed [[transfer orbit]] that would pass close to two [[celestial bodies]] at regular intervals. Cyclers could be used for carrying heavy supplies, [[Life-support system|life support]] and [[radiation protection|radiation shielding]].

==Free return trajectory==
A [[free-return trajectory]] is a symmetrical orbit past the Moon and Earth that was first analysed by Arthur Schwaniger<ref name="traj">{{cite book|last=Schwaninger|first=Arthur J.|title=Trajectories in the Earth-Moon Space with Symmetrical Free Return Properties|publisher=[[NASA]] / [[Marshall Space Flight Center]]|location=Huntsville, Alabama|year=1963|series=Technical Note D-1833|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uiug.30112106596973;view=1up;seq=28}}</ref>

==Lunar cycler==
{{main|Lunar cycler}}
A ''lunar cycler'' or ''Earth–Moon cycler'' is a cycler orbit, or [[spacecraft]] therein, which periodically passes close by the [[Earth]] and the [[Moon]], using [[gravity assist]]s and occasional [[orbital maneuver|propellant-powered corrections]] to maintain its trajectories between the two. If the fuel required to reach a particular cycler orbit from both the Earth and the Moon is modest, and the travel time between the two along the cycler is reasonable, then having a spacecraft in the cycler can provide an efficient and regular method for space transportation.<ref>{{cite report |author1=Kenneth D.

==Mars cycler==
{{main|Mars cycler}}
A ''Mars cycler'' or ''Earth–Mars cycler'' is a spacecraft trajectory that encounters the Earth and Mars on a regular basis, or a spacecraft on such a trajectory

==Interstellar cycler==
{{main|Interstellar cycler}}
An ''interstellar cycler'' or ''Schroeder cycler'', a theoretical spacecraft trajectory that encounters two or more stars on a regular basis, or a spacecraft on such a trajectory
