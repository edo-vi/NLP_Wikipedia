The term '''contour currents''' was first introduced by Heezen et al in 1966<ref name="Heezen">{{cite journal |last1=Heezen |first1=BC |last2=Hollister |first2=CD |last3=Ruddiman |first3=WF |title=Shaping of the continental rise by deep geostrophic contour currents. |journal=Science |date=22 April 1966 |volume=152 |issue=3721 |pages=502–8 |doi=10.1126/science.152.3721.502 |pmid=17815077 |access-date= |bibcode=1966Sci...152..502H | s2cid= 29313948  |language=en |issn=0036-8075 }}</ref> as bottom currents along the continental shelf driven by [[Coriolis force|Coriolis effects]] and temperature/salinity dependent density gradients. Generally, the currents flow along depth contours, hence called contour currents. Sediments deposited and shaped by the contour currents are called contourites,<ref name="Hollister">{{cite journal |last1=Hollister |first1=C.D. |title=The concept of deep-sea contourites |journal=Sedimentary Geology |date=January 1993 |volume=82 |issue=1–4 |pages=5–11 |doi=10.1016/0037-0738(93)90109-I |access-date= |language=en |issn=0036-8075 |bibcode=1993SedG...82....5H}}</ref> which are commonly observed in continental rise.

Since contour currents generally flow at speed of 2–20 cm/s, their capacity to carry sediments is limited to fine grain particles already in suspension.<ref name="Heezen"/><ref name="Zhao">{{cite journal |last1=Zhao |first1=Yulong |last2=Liu |first2=Zhifei |last3=Zhang |first3=Yanwei |last4=Li |first4=Jianru |last5=Wang |first5=Meng |last6=Wang |first6=Wenguang |last7=Xu |first7=Jingping |title=In situ observation of contour currents in the northern South China Sea: Applications for deepwater sediment transport |journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters |date=1 November 2015 |volume=430 |pages=477–485 |doi=10.1016/j.epsl.2015.09.008 |bibcode=2015E&PSL.430..477Z |url=https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015E&PSL.430..477Z/abstract |access-date=8 December 2021 |issn=0012-821X}}</ref> Redistribution of sediments by contour currents have, however, been reported as evidenced by the sea floor morphological features parallel to regional [[Isobath|isobaths]].<ref name="Schneider">{{cite journal |last1=Schneider |first1=Eric D. |last2=Fox |first2=Paul J. |last3=Hollister |first3=Charles D. |last4=Needham |first4=H.

Turbidity currents, on the other hand, flow down slope across regional isobaths and are mainly responsible for supplying [[terrigenous sediment]] across [[continental margins]] to deep-water environments, such as continental rise, where fine particles are further carried in suspension by contour currents. The joint depositional processes of the two current systems contribute to the dominant factors influencing the [[Geomorphology|morphology]] of the lower continental margins.<ref name="Normandeau">{{cite journal |last1=Normandeau |first1=Alexandre |last2=Campbell |first2=D.
