=== [[Opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War|American Resistance to the Vietnam War]] ===
In the early ‘60s and into the ‘70s, Americans of many backgrounds were unified over a shared opposition to the [[Vietnam War]]. The most well-known demonstration for many is the [[Kent State shootings|Kent State University protest]] where four students were killed by the [[Ohio National Guard]] on May 4, 1970.<ref>{{Citation|title=A People's History of the United States|date=2016-01-08|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.4324/9781315636245-7|work=Howard Zinn on Democratic Education|pages=73–92|publisher=Routledge|doi=10.4324/9781315636245-7|isbn=978-1-315-63624-5|access-date=2021-05-11}}</ref> Among the many forms of resistance during this time, the most enduring product of this movement is the United States voting age being lowered from 21 to 18 years of age.<ref>{{Cite web|title=The 26th Amendment|url=https://www.history.com/topics/united-states-constitution/the-26th-amendment|access-date=2021-05-11|website=HISTORY|language=en}}</ref>

=== Argentinian Resistance and The Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo ===
The [[Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo]] (Las Madres de la Plaza de Mayo) is an Argentinian human rights group that began demonstrating in 1977 in response to the [[National Reorganization Process]] of Jorge Rafael Videla's military dictatorship. They are a group of mothers and grandmothers whose initial goal was finding their disappeared family members, or ''[[Forced disappearance|desaparecidos]]'', who were illegally abducted and detained by the Argininian regime and holding accountable those who were responsible. Their political resistance, which continues today, is characterized by both large demonstrations in front of the [[Casa Rosada]] presidential palace and various graffiti art exhibitions,<ref>{{Cite web|last=themetropoleblog|date=2018-05-14|title=Graffiti art, Protest and Memory in the Plaza de Mayo, Buenos Aires city|url=https://themetropole.blog/2018/05/14/graffiti-art-protest-and-memory-in-the-plaza-de-mayo-buenos-aires-city/|access-date=2021-05-11|website=The Metropole|language=en}}</ref> which act as a public archive of this atrocity and a call to action in addressing current events. Subsequent photo art, films, poetry and memoirs have continued to commemorate the group's ongoing activism.

=== Literary Studies ===
In literary studies, resistance literature is one subfield in which to study [[Literature|literary output]] that may be understood as a [[Power (social and political)|socio-political]] activity to resist dominant ideologies.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|last=DeShazer|first=Mary K.|url=https://archive.org/details/poeticsofresista00desh|title=A Poetics of Resistance: Women Writing in El Salvador, South Africa, and the United States|date=1994|publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=978-0-472-06563-9|location=|pages=[https://archive.org/details/poeticsofresista00desh/page/9 9]|language=en|quote=resistance literature.|url-access=registration}}</ref> Resistance literature can be used to resist gender-based oppression, or to demonstrate difficulties in liberation struggles or writing in exile.<ref name=":0" /><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kaplan|first=Caren|date=1989|title=Resistance Literature, and: The Writer Written: The Artist and Creation in the New Literatures in English (review)|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/242978|journal=MFS Modern Fiction Studies|language=en|volume=35|issue=1|pages=181–186|doi=10.1353/mfs.0.0551|issn=1080-658X|s2cid=161854949}}</ref> Studying resistance literature is one way to challenge norms and defy culture practices that can, in some instances, give hope.<ref name=":0" /><ref>{{Cite book|last=Bevan|first=David|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tfB4Qi01QQQC&q=%22resistance+literature%22&pg=PA123|title=Literature and War|date=1990|publisher=Rodopi|isbn=978-90-5183-162-7|location=|pages=123|language=en}}</ref> Analyzing depictions of armed resistance in fields like political science or history can demonstrate how governmental and civil change occur, only literature also has a role to play.

=== Weimar Republic Anti-fascist Resistance ===
Christopher Isherwood was a queer author who lived in Weimar Germany from 1929 to 1933, fleeing in ‘33 to escape Nazi Germany.

=== Southern U.S. Border Militarization ===
The [[Mexico–United States border|Mexico-United States border]] is heavily policed in the United States, with some stretches of it including fences, walls, floodlights, and guards that became more common place after the introduction of "prevention through deterence" strategies in the 1990s.<ref>{{Cite book|date=2010-10-01|title=Operation Gatekeeper and beyond: the war on "illegals" and the remaking of the U.S. - Mexico boundary}}</ref> Arizona is one of the most dangerous places to cross the border due to the presence of the [[Sonoran Desert]] and conservative immigration laws.

=== Women's Suffrage ===
Popular forms of art that were used during the [[Women's suffrage|Women's Suffrage Movement]] were banners, posters, postcards, and newspaper cartoons.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Art & Women's Suffrage - Museum of London|url=https://artsandculture.google.com/exhibit/art-women-s-suffrage/GQLSZHz8nh2nJA|access-date=2021-05-23|website=Google Arts & Culture|language=en}}</ref> In 1907 the [[Artists' Suffrage League|Artists’ Suffrage League]] was formed, founded by [[Mary Lowndes]], a British stained-glass artist.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|last=MutualArt|date=2020-08-23|title=Women, Art, and Suffrage: How Interconnection Propelled a Movement|url=https://medium.com/mutualart/women-art-and-suffrage-how-interconnection-propelled-a-movement-f6794e87fdfd|access-date=2021-05-23|website=Medium|language=en}}</ref> By 1913, the ASP was forming a united front in America as well, supplying art to women's suffrage groups and aiding the spread of information.<ref name=":1" />

=== Black Feminism ===
While Black feminist writings have been recorded as far back as the 1830s the first widely known Black feminist was [[Sojourner Truth]] who believed that race and gender could not be separated in discussions of oppression.<ref name="nmaahc.si.edu">{{Cite web|title=THE REVOLUTIONARY PRACTICE OF BLACK FEMINISMS|url=https://nmaahc.si.edu/explore/stories/collection/revolutionary-practice-black-feminisms|access-date= 2021-05-23|website=The National Museum of African American History and Culture|language=en}}</ref> [[Kimberlé Crenshaw]] would coin this term in an essay as intersectionality.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Mapping the Margins: Intersectionality, Identity Politics, and Violence against Women of Color|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/1229039|access-date=2021-05-23|journal=Stanford Law Review| jstor=1229039 | last1=Crenshaw | first1=Kimberle | year=1991 | volume=43 | issue=6 | pages=1241–1299 | doi=10.2307/1229039 }}</ref> Black feminism relies on three distinct principles: that Black women's experiences of classism, sexism and racism are all inextricably linked, that racism, sexism, and “all other -isms” need to addressed together, and that black women have different needs and worldviews than those of both white women and black men.<ref name="nmaahc.si.edu"/>

=== Iranian Revolution ===
Censorship and suppression of human rights during the [[Iranian Revolution]] (1978-179) prompted the publication of novels and poems speaking about experiences of abuse and oppression.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Ziaee|first=Donya|date=February 8, 2019|title=Anguish, hope and resistance: 40 years since the Iranian Revolution|url=https://www.cbc.ca/radio/sunday/the-sunday-edition-for-february-10-2019-1.5011120/anguish-hope-and-resistance-40-years-since-the-iranian-revolution-1.5011166|website=CBC}}</ref> There has been a particular rise in Iranian women's literature addressing restrictive laws and social norms surrounding dress code, marriage, and the workforce.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Fathi|first=Nazila|date=2005-06-29|title=Women Writing Novels Emerge as Stars in Iran|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/29/books/women-writing-novels-emerge-as-stars-in-iran.html|access-date=2021-05-24|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> Many stories are written by Iranian women who grew up during the [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi|Shah]] and/or [[Ruhollah Khomeini|Khomeini]] regime but are now writing in exile, reflecting on their experiences and the impact these events continue to have on Iranian culture.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Voices in Exile: Three Poets|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/tehranbureau/2010/10/voices-in-exile-three-poets.html|access-date=2021-05-24|website=FRONTLINE - Tehran Bureau|language=en}}</ref>

== Forms of resistance literature ==
Resistance can also be in the form of humour, [[Bitch (slang)#Other forms|bitching]] and gossip.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Dutta|first=Mohan J.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e1_Wgrd4POgC&q=%22resistance+literature%22&pg=PA11|title=Voices of Resistance: Communication and Social Change|date=2012|publisher=Purdue University Press|isbn=978-1-55753-627-3|location=|pages=11|language=en}}</ref>

=== Archival Creation and Restoration ===
Archives can often be the site of recovered or restored pieces of history such as newspapers, zines, flyers, manuscripts, letters, photographs, bills, interviews (in conjunction with oral history), other documents, and digital resources.<ref>{{cite web |title=Archives 101: Preservation, Conservation, Restoration |url=https://medium.com/save-texas-history/archives-101-preservation-conservation-restoration-a2d9981b0820 |website=Medium|date=23 April 2020 }}</ref>  Archives naturally become a part of resistance literature because they reaffirm a person, people's, or events place in history<ref>{{cite web |title=OSU Queer Archives: LGBTQ+ ARCHIVAL REPOSITORIES |url=https://guides.library.oregonstate.edu/osqa/lgbtq-archives |website=Oregon State University}}</ref> and combats the narrative that only what is immediately documented, available, or institutionally produced is true. They've become a pivotal resource in keeping the memory of marginalized communities alive and are undoubtedly a piece of resistance literature.

=== Novel Writing ===
Throughout many periods of history, novels of fiction have been written by authors who lived through periods of resistance, and the power of these stories has brought positive social change.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Müller|first=Aline|date=2020-02-05|title=What's the Role of Fiction in Social Change?|url=https://medium.com/literally-literary/whats-the-role-of-fiction-in-social-change-564497f91125|access-date=2021-05-11|website=Medium|language=en}}</ref> Some well-known examples of this include [[Upton Sinclair]]’s 1906 novel ''[[The Jungle]]'' and ''[[The Grapes of Wrath]]'' by [[John Steinbeck]], both of which resulted in more rights for the working class.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2018-11-05|title=12 books that forever transformed America as we know it|url=https://www.businessinsider.nl/books-that-changed-american-policy-2018-4/|access-date=2021-05-11|website=Business Insider Nederland|language=nl}}</ref>

=== Theater ===
Since the beginning of Western civilization, plays have been used as a way to protest against social problems and reflect the social and political trends of society.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lippman|first=Monroe|date=1955-12-01|title=An analysis of the protest play|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/10417945509371398|journal=The Southern Speech Journal|volume=21|issue=2|pages=127–132|doi=10.1080/10417945509371398|issn=0038-4585}}</ref> For example, [[San Francisco Mime Troupe|The San Francisco Mime Troupe]] was created to produce theater that exposes injustices through [[political satire]] in the form of [[Play (theatre)|plays]] and [[Musical theatre|musicals]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=About Us|url=https://www.sfmt.org/about-us|access-date=2021-05-11|website=SFMT|language=en}}</ref>

=== Zine Making ===
[[Zine]]s, short for magazine or fanzine, have been used to cheaply spread political views and information. Zines began in fan communities in the 1930s, but began to gain a political edge in the 1960s and 70s in punk communities when zines began to be easier to produce.<ref>{{Cite web|title=A Brief History of Zines {{!}} Digital Collections Blog|url=https://blogs.library.duke.edu/digital-collections/zines/timeline/|access-date=2021-05-11|language=en-US}}</ref>
