'''TESCREAL''' is an [[acronym]] [[neologism]], proposed by [[Timnit Gebru]] and [[Émile Torres]], standing for "''[[transhumanism]]'', ''[[extropianism]]'', ''[[singularitarianism]]'', ''[[cosmism]]'', ''[[rationalism]]'' (as espoused by [[Eliezer Yudkowsky]] in the [[LessWrong]] blog community),<ref name=Twitter_Torres_Conversation > {{ cite web | url=https://x.com/xriskology/status/1671095545312563201 | title=Twitter conversation about the description of anti-TESCREAL as a conspiracy theory | last=Torres | first=Émile | author-link= | date=2023-06-20  | website= | publisher= | access-date=2023-10-14 | quote=This is funny because Sandberg is a transhumanist who participated in the Extropian movement, anticipates the Singularity, has a long history with cosmists (Goertzel) and Rationalists (Yudkowsky), is very influential among Rationalists and EAs, comments on the LessWrong blog, and [...] }} </ref> ''[[Effective Altruism]]'', and ''[[longtermism]]''." Gebru and Torres allege that these concepts overlap, especially in social and academic circles in [[Silicon Valley]] centered around [[artificial intelligence]]. As such, the acronym is sometimes used by them to criticize a perceived belief system associated with [[Big Tech]].<ref name=was1>{{cite web |url=https://washingtonspectator.org/understanding-tescreal-silicon-valleys-rightward-turn/ |title=The Wide Angle: Understanding TESCREAL — the Weird Ideologies Behind Silicon Valley’s Rightward Turn |last=Troy |first=Dave |date=1 May 2023 |website= |publisher=[[The Washington Spectator]] |access-date=1 October 2023|quote=}}</ref><ref name=dig1>{{cite web |url=https://www.truthdig.com/articles/the-acronym-behind-our-wildest-ai-dreams-and-nightmares/ |title=The Acronym Behind Our Wildest AI Dreams and Nightmares |last= |first= |date=15 June 2023 |website= |publisher= |access-date=1 October 2023 |quote=}}</ref><ref name=financial1>{{cite web |url=https://www.ft.com/content/edc30352-05fb-4fd8-a503-20b50ce014ab |title=We need to examine the beliefs of today’s tech luminaries  |last= |first= |date= |website= |publisher=Financial Times |access-date=1 October 2023 |quote=}}</ref><ref name=business1>{{cite web |url=https://www.businessinsider.com/sam-altman-openai-chatgpt-worldcoin-helion-future-tech-2023-4?op=1 |title=He's played chess with Peter Thiel, sparred with Elon Musk and once, supposedly, stopped a plane crash: Inside Sam Altman's world, where truth is stranger than fiction |last= |first= |date= |website= |publisher=Business Insider |access-date=1 October 2023 |quote=}}</ref> Neşe Devenot has used the TESCREAL acronym to also refer to "global tech elites" who promote new uses of [[psychedelic drugs]] as [[mental health]] treatments, not because they want to help people, but rather so that they can make money on the sale of these new pharmaceuticals, as part of a deliberate plan to increase inequality.<ref name="devenot">{{cite journal |last1=Devenot |first1=Neşe |last2= |first2= |date=2023 |title=TESCREAL hallucinations: Psychedelic and AI hype as inequality engines |url=https://akjournals.com/view/journals/2054/aop/article-10.1556-2054.2023.00292/article-10.1556-2054.2023.00292.xml |journal=Journal of Psychedelic Studies |volume= |issue= |pages= |doi= |access-date= | quote=Counterfactual efforts to improve mental health by increasing inequality are widespread in the psychedelics industry.

While others have noted similarities between the earlier SSRI hype and the ongoing hype for psychedelic medications, the rhetoric of psychedelic hype is tinged with utopian and magico-religious aspirations that have no parallel in the discourse surrounding SSRIs or other antidepressants.

Torres claims that these ideas have previous overlaps;<ref name="dig1" /> that transhumanism, extropianism and singularitarianism are presented as a coherent set of ideas by [[Ray Kurzweil]], a notable technology evangelist and AI researcher at [[Google]].<ref name=was1/> Dave Troy, a reporter for the [[The Washington Spectator]], attributes [[Konstantin Tsiolkovsky]], a Russian rocket scientist and proponent of Cosmism, as an influence on [[Elon Musk]].{{ r | was1 | p=1 | q=Cosmism, the “C” in TESCREAL, is a set of ideologies advanced by Russian scientists and philosophers such as Nikolai Fyodorov, Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, and Vladimir Vernadsky. ...

Many of the discourses around an [[existential risk from artificial general intelligence]] occur among supporters of the TESCREAL ideologies.<ref name=was1/>

Sociologist, transhumanist, and bioethicist [[James Hughes (sociologist)|James J. Hughes]] (with Eli Sennesh) characterizes this analysis of futurist ideas and people as a [[conspiracy theory]], and states: "These new left conspiracists cast all futurist philosophies together under the acronym of TESCREAL, linked in their minds to [[eugenics]] and [[racism]]. Again, there is a web of facts underlying their fantasies, just as [Jeffrey] [[Jeffrey Epstein|Epstein]] was confirmatory for [[QAnon]]. But the conspiracy style of argumentation is bad intellectual history and bad politics."<ref name=Medium_Hughes > {{ cite web | url=https://medium.com/institute-for-ethics-and-emerging-technologies/conspiracy-theories-left-futurism-and-the-attack-on-tescreal-456972fe02aa | title=Conspiracy Theories, Left Futurism, and the Attack on TESCREAL - Some critics have decided futurist philosophies and their advocates are bound together in a toxic, reactionary bundle, promoted by a cabal of Silicon Valley elites. This style of conspiracy analysis has a long history and is always a misleading way to understand the world. We need a Left futurism that can address the flaws of these philosophies and frame a liberatory vision. | last=Hughes | first=James | author-link=James Hughes (sociologist) | work= | date=2023-06-12 | quote=We completely support a ruthless deconstruction of the shallow, self-serving, and dangerous ways that some billionaires have adopted these futurist ideas. But reducing two hundred years of intellectual history and political reality to the sloppy musings of a handful of tech bros and a tenuous web of guilt by association is seriously misleading, like all conspiracy theories. ... Worse, the anti-TESCREAL conspiracy is reactive rather than proactive. }} </ref> Torres has rejected the description.<ref name=Twitter_Torres_Conversation></ref>
