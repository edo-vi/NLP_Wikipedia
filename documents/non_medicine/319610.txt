In [[biology]], a '''biological life cycle''' (or just '''life cycle''' when the biological context is clear) is a series of stages of the life of an organism, that begins as a zygote, often in an egg, and concludes as an adult that reproduces, producing an offspring in the form of a new zygote which then itself goes through the same series of stages, the process repeating in a cyclic fashion.

"The concept is closely related to those of the life history, [[Developmental biology|development]] and [[ontogeny]], but differs from them in stressing renewal."<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bell |first1=Graham |last2=Koufopanou |first2=Vassiliki |title=The Architecture of the Life Cycle in Small Organisms |journal=Philosophical Transactions: Biological Sciences |date=1991 |volume=332 |issue=1262 |pages=81–89 |doi=10.1098/rstb.1991.0035 |jstor=55494 |bibcode=1991RSPTB.332...81B }}</ref><ref name=rodr2014/> Transitions of form may involve growth, [[asexual reproduction]], or [[sexual reproduction]].

In some organisms, different "generations" of the species succeed each other during the life cycle. For [[Embryophyte|plants]] and many [[algae]], there are two multicellular stages, and the life cycle is referred to as [[alternation of generations]]. The term '''life history''' is often used, particularly for organisms such as the [[red algae]] which have three multicellular stages (or more), rather than two.<ref name="Dixon73">Dixon, P.S. 1973. ''Biology of the Rhodophyta.'' Oliver & Boyd. {{ISBN|0 05 002485 X}}{{pn|date=July 2021}}</ref>

Life cycles that include sexual reproduction involve alternating [[haploid]] (''n'') and [[diploid]] (2''n'') stages, i.e., a change of [[ploidy]] is involved. To return from a diploid stage to a haploid stage, [[meiosis]] must occur. In regard to changes of [[ploidy]], there are three types of cycles:
*''haplontic'' life cycle — the haploid stage is multicellular and the diploid stage is a single cell, meiosis is "zygotic".
*''diplontic'' life cycle — the diploid stage is multicellular and haploid [[gamete]]s are formed, meiosis is "gametic".
*''haplodiplontic'' life cycle (also referred to as ''diplohaplontic'', ''diplobiontic'', or ''dibiontic'' life cycle) — multicellular diploid and haploid stages occur, meiosis is "sporic".

The cycles differ in when [[mitosis]] (growth) occurs. Zygotic meiosis and gametic meiosis have one mitotic stage: mitosis occurs during the ''n'' phase in zygotic meiosis and during the 2''n'' phase in gametic meiosis. Therefore, zygotic and gametic meiosis are collectively termed "haplobiontic" (single mitotic phase, not to be confused with haplontic). Sporic meiosis, on the other hand, has mitosis in two stages, both the diploid and haploid stages, termed "diplobiontic" (not to be confused with diplontic).{{fact|date=July 2021}}

==Discovery==
The study of [[reproduction]] and [[Embryogenesis|development]] in organisms was carried out by many botanists and zoologists.

[[Wilhelm Hofmeister]] demonstrated that [[alternation of generations]] is a feature that unites plants, and published this result in 1851 (see [[History of botany#Plant sexuality|plant sexuality]]).

Some terms (haplobiont and diplobiont) used for the description of life cycles were proposed initially for algae by Nils Svedelius, and then became used for other organisms.<ref>{{Citation |title=Nils Eberhard Svedelius. 1873-1960 | author=C.

==Haplontic life cycle==
[[File:Haploid English.svg|thumb|250px|Zygotic meiosis]]
A zygotic meiosis is a [[meiosis]] of a [[zygote]] immediately after [[karyogamy]], which is the fusion of two [[cell nucleus|cell nuclei]]. This way, the organism ends its diploid phase and produces several haploid cells. These cells divide [[mitotic]]ally to form either larger, multicellular individuals, or more haploid cells. Two opposite types of gametes (e.g., male and female) from these individuals or cells fuse to become a zygote.

In the whole cycle, zygotes are the only diploid cell; mitosis occurs only in the haploid phase.

The individuals or cells as a result of mitosis are haplonts, hence this life cycle is also called haplontic life cycle. Haplonts are:

==Diplontic life cycle==
[[File:Diploid English.svg|thumb|250px|Gametic meiosis]]

In gametic meiosis, instead of immediately dividing ''meiotically'' to produce haploid cells, the zygote divides ''mitotically'' to produce a multicellular diploid individual or a group of more unicellular diploid cells. Cells from the diploid individuals then undergo meiosis to produce haploid cells or [[gamete]]s. Haploid cells may divide again (by mitosis) to form more haploid cells, as in many yeasts, but the haploid phase is not the predominant life cycle phase. In most diplonts, mitosis occurs only in the diploid phase, i.e. gametes usually form quickly and fuse to produce diploid zygotes.{{fact|date=July 2021}}

In the whole cycle, gametes are usually the only haploid cells, and mitosis usually occurs only in the diploid phase.

The diploid multicellular individual is a diplont, hence a gametic meiosis is also called a diplontic life cycle. Diplonts are:

* In [[archaeplastida]]ns: some [[green algae]] (e.g., ''[[Cladophora|Cladophora glomerata]]'',<ref>O. P. Sharma. Textbook of Algae, p. 189</ref> ''[[Acetabularia]]''<ref name="Díaz1"/><ref name="Díaz2"/>)

==Haplodiplontic life cycle==
[[File:Diplohaplontic English.svg|thumb|250px|Sporic meiosis]]
{{Main|Alternation of generations}}
In sporic meiosis (also commonly known as intermediary meiosis), the zygote divides mitotically to produce a multicellular diploid [[sporophyte]]. The sporophyte creates spores via meiosis which ''also'' then divide mitotically producing haploid individuals called [[gametophyte]]s. The gametophytes produce gametes via mitosis. In some plants the gametophyte is not only small-sized but also short-lived; in other plants and many algae, the gametophyte is the "dominant" stage of the life cycle.{{fact|date=July 2021}}

Haplodiplonts are:

* In [[archaeplastida]]ns: [[red algae]] (which have two sporophyte generations), some [[green algae]] (e.g., ''[[Ulva (genus)|Ulva]]''), [[Embryophyte|land plants]]<ref name="Díaz1"/><ref name="Díaz2"/>
* In [[stramenopiles]]: most [[brown algae]]<ref name="Díaz1"/><ref name="Díaz2"/>
* In [[rhizaria]]ns: many [[foraminiferan]]s,<ref name="Ruppert" /> [[plasmodiophoromycetes]]<ref name="Díaz1"/><ref name="Díaz2"/>
* In [[amoebozoa]]: [[myxogastrid]]s
* In [[opisthokont]]s: some [[fungi]] (some [[chytrid]]s, some [[ascomycetes]] like the [[brewer's yeast]])<ref name="Díaz1"/><ref name="Díaz2"/>
* Other eukaryotes: [[haptophyte]]s<ref name="Ruppert" />

Some animals have a [[sex-determination system]] called [[haplodiploid]], but this is not related to the haplodiplontic life cycle.

== Vegetative meiosis ==
Some [[red algae]] (such as ''[[Bonnemaisonia]]''<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Salvador Soler |first1=Noemi |last2=Gómez Garreta |first2=Amelia |last3=Antonia Ribera Siguan |first3=M. |title=Somatic meiosis in the life history of Bonnemaisonia asparagoides and Bonnemaisonia clavata (Bonnemaisoniales, Rhodophyta) from the Iberian peninsula |journal=European Journal of Phycology |date=August 2009 |volume=44 |issue=3 |pages=381–393 |doi=10.1080/09670260902780782 |s2cid=217511084 }}</ref> and ''[[Lemanea]]'') and green algae (such as ''[[Prasiola]]'') have vegetative meiosis, also called somatic meiosis, which is a rare phenomenon.{{sfn|van den Hoek|Mann|Jahns|1995|p=82}} Vegetative meiosis can occur in haplodiplontic and also in diplontic life cycles. The gametophytes remain attached to and part of the sporophyte. Vegetative (non-reproductive) diploid cells undergo meiosis, generating vegetative haploid cells. These undergo many mitosis, and produces gametes.

A different phenomenon, called vegetative diploidization, a type of [[apomixis]], occurs in some [[brown alga]]e (e.g., ''Elachista stellaris'').<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Lewis |first1=Raymond J. |title=Chromosomes of the brown algae |journal=Phycologia |date=January 1996 |volume=35 |issue=1 |pages=19–40 |doi=10.2216/i0031-8884-35-1-19.1 }}</ref> Cells in a haploid part of the plant spontaneously duplicate their chromosomes to produce diploid tissue.

==Parasitic life cycle==

Parasites depend on the exploitation of one or more [[host (biology)|hosts]]. Those that must infect more than one host [[species]] to complete their life cycles are said to have complex or indirect life cycles. ''[[Dirofilaria immitis]],'' or the heartworm, has an indirect life cycle, for example. The [[Microfilaria|microfilariae]] must first be ingested by a female [[mosquito]], where it develops into the infective [[Larva|larval]] stage. The mosquito then bites an animal and transmits the infective larvae into the animal, where they migrate to the [[pulmonary artery]] and mature into adults.<ref>{{Cite web|title=VetFolio|url=https://www.vetfolio.com/learn/article/canine-and-feline-dirofilariasis-life-cycle-pathophysiology-and-diagnosis|access-date=2021-05-18|website=www.vetfolio.com}}</ref>  

Those parasites that infect a single species have direct life cycles. An example of a parasite with a direct life cycle is ''[[Ancylostoma caninum]]'', or the canine hookworm. They develop to the infective larval stage in the environment, then penetrate the skin of the dog directly and mature to adults in the [[small intestine]].<ref>{{cite book |doi=10.1016/B978-1-4160-4889-3.00019-X |chapter=Parasitic and Protozoal Diseases |title=Small Animal Pediatrics |year=2011 |last1=Datz |first1=Craig |pages=154–160 |isbn=978-1-4160-4889-3 }}</ref>

If a parasite has to infect a given host in order to complete its life cycle, then it is said to be an [[obligate parasite]] of that host; sometimes, infection is [[Facultative parasite|facultative]]—the parasite can survive and complete its life cycle without infecting that particular host species. Parasites sometimes infect hosts in which they cannot complete their life cycles; these are accidental hosts.

A host in which parasites reproduce sexually is known as the definitive, final or primary host. In intermediate hosts, parasites either do not reproduce or do so asexually, but the parasite always develops to a new stage in this type of host. In some cases a parasite will infect a host, but not undergo any development, these hosts are known as [[paratenic]]<ref>Schmidt and Roberts. 1985. Foundations of Parasitology 3rd Ed.  Times Mirror/Mosby College Publishing{{pn|date=July 2021}}</ref> or transport hosts. The paratenic host can be useful in raising the chance that the parasite will be transmitted to the definitive host. For example, the cat lungworm (''[[Aelurostrongylus abstrusus]]'') uses a slug or snail as an intermediate host; the first stage larva enters the mollusk and develops to the third stage larva, which is infectious to the definitive host—the cat. If a mouse eats the slug, the third stage larva will enter the mouse's tissues, but will not undergo any development.{{fact|date=July 2021}}

==Evolution==
The primitive type of life cycle probably had haploid individuals with asexual reproduction.<ref name="Ruppert" /> [[Bacteria]] and [[archaea]] exhibit a life cycle like this, and some eukaryotes apparently do too (e.g., [[Cryptophyta]], [[Choanoflagellata]], many [[Euglenozoa]], many [[Amoebozoa]], some red algae, some [[green algae]], the [[imperfect fungi]], some [[rotifer]]s and many other groups, not necessarily haploid).<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Heywood, P. |author2=Magee, P.T. |year=1976|title=Meiosis in protists.

Individual organisms participating in a biological life cycle ordinarily age and die, while cells from these organisms that connect successive life cycle generations (germ line cells and their descendants) are potentially immortal. The basis for this difference is a fundamental problem in biology.  The Russian biologist and historian [[Zhores A. Medvedev]]<ref name = Medvedev1981>{{cite journal |last=Medvedev |first=Zhores A. |title=On the immortality of the germ line: Genetic and biochemical mechanisms. A review |journal=Mechanisms of Ageing and Development |volume=17 |issue=4 |year=1981 |pages=331–359 |doi=10.1016/0047-6374(81)90052-X |pmid=6173551 |s2cid=35719466 }}</ref> considered that the accuracy of [[genome]] replicative and other synthetic systems alone cannot explain the immortality of [[germ line]]s. Rather Medvedev thought that known features of the biochemistry and genetics of [[sexual reproduction]] indicate the presence of unique information maintenance and restoration processes at the [[gametogenesis]] stage of the biological life cycle. In particular, Medvedev considered that the most important opportunities for information maintenance of [[germ cell]]s are created by [[genetic recombination|recombination during meiosis]] and [[DNA repair]]; he saw these as processes within the germ line cells that were capable of restoring the integrity of [[DNA]] and [[chromosome]]s from the types of damage that cause irreversible ageing in non-germ line cells, e.g. [[somatic cell]]s.<ref name = Medvedev1981/>

The ancestry of each present day cell presumably traces back, in an unbroken lineage for over 3 billion years to the [[abiogenesis|origin of life]]. It is not actually cells that are [[immortality|immortal]] but multi-generational cell lineages.<ref name = Bernstein2000>{{cite book |doi=10.1007/978-3-662-06227-2_2 |chapter=Cell Immortality: Maintenance of Cell Division Potential |title=Cell Immortalization |series=Progress in Molecular and Subcellular Biology |year=1999 |last1=Bernstein |first1=C. |last2=Bernstein |first2=H. |last3=Payne |first3=C. |volume=24 |pages=23–50 |pmid=10547857 |isbn=978-3-642-08491-1 }}</ref> The immortality of a cell lineage depends on the maintenance of [[cell division]] potential.
