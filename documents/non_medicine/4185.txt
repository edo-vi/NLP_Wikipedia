A '''bacteriophage''' ({{IPAc-en|b|æ|k|ˈ|t|ɪər|i|əʊ|f|eɪ|dʒ}}), also known informally as a '''''phage''''' ({{IPAc-en|'|f|eɪ|dʒ}}), is a [[virus]] that infects and replicates within [[bacteria]] and [[archaea]]. The term was derived from "bacteria" and the [[Greek language|Greek]] φαγεῖν (''{{lang|grc-Latn|phagein}}''), meaning "to devour". Bacteriophages are composed of [[protein]]s that [[Capsid|encapsulate]] a [[DNA]] or [[RNA]] [[genome]], and may have structures that are either simple or elaborate. Their genomes may encode as few as four genes (e.g. [[Bacteriophage MS2|MS2]]) and as many as hundreds of [[genes]]. Phages replicate within the bacterium following the injection of their genome into its [[cytoplasm]].

Bacteriophages are among the most common and diverse entities in the [[biosphere]].<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite book | veditors  = McGrath S, van Sinderen D | title = Bacteriophage: Genetics and Molecular Biology | edition = 1st | publisher = Caister Academic Press | year = 2007 | url=http://www.horizonpress.com/phage | isbn = 978-1-904455-14-1}}</ref> Bacteriophages are ubiquitous viruses, found wherever bacteria exist.

[[File:Félix d'Hérelle.jpg|right|thumb|upright|[[Félix d'Herelle]] conducted the first clinical application of a bacteriophage]]

# an [[enzyme]] produced by the bacteria themselves, or
# a virus that grew on and destroyed the bacteria<ref>{{Cite journal | vauthors = Twort FW | title = An Investigation on the Nature of Ultra-Microscopic Viruses | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(01)20383-3 | journal = The Lancet | volume = 186 | issue = 4814 | pages = 1241–43 | year = 1915 | url = https://zenodo.org/record/2380119 }}</ref>

Twort's research was interrupted by the onset of [[World War I]], as well as a shortage of funding and the discoveries of antibiotics.

Independently, [[French-Canadian]] [[microbiologist]] [[Félix d'Hérelle]], working at the [[Pasteur Institute]] in [[Paris]], announced on 3 September 1917 that he had discovered "an invisible, antagonistic microbe of the [[dysentery]] bacillus". For d'Hérelle, there was no question as to the nature of his discovery: "In a flash I had understood: what caused my clear spots was in fact an invisible microbe... a virus parasitic on bacteria."<ref name= "Herelle1917">{{cite journal | vauthors = d'Hérelles F |year=1917 |title= Sur un microbe invisible antagoniste des bacilles dysentériques |journal= Comptes Rendus de l'Académie des Sciences de Paris |volume= 165 |pages=373–5 |url= http://202.114.65.51/fzjx/wsw/wswfzjs/pdf/1917p157.pdf |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110511183504/http://202.114.65.51/fzjx/wsw/wswfzjs/pdf/1917p157.pdf |archive-date=11 May 2011 |access-date=5 September 2010  |url-status = live}}</ref> D'Hérelle called the virus a bacteriophage, a bacteria-eater (from the Greek ''{{lang|grc-Latn|phagein}}'', meaning "to devour").

Phages were discovered to be antibacterial agents and were used in the former [[Soviet]] Republic of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] (pioneered there by [[Giorgi Eliava]] with help from the co-discoverer of bacteriophages, [[Félix d'Hérelle]]) during the 1920s and 1930s for treating bacterial infections. They had widespread use, including treatment of soldiers in the [[Red Army]].{{citation needed|date=October 2022}} However, they were abandoned for general use in the West for several reasons:
* Antibiotics were discovered and marketed widely. They were easier to make, store, and prescribe.
* Medical trials of phages were carried out, but a basic lack of understanding of phages raised questions about the validity of these trials.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kutter E, De Vos D, Gvasalia G, Alavidze Z, Gogokhia L, Kuhl S, Abedon ST | title = Phage therapy in clinical practice: treatment of human infections | journal = Current Pharmaceutical Biotechnology | volume = 11 | issue = 1 | pages = 69–86 | date = January 2010 | pmid = 20214609 | doi = 10.2174/138920110790725401 | s2cid = 31626252 }}</ref>

'''[[Phage display]]''' is a different use of phages involving a library of phages with a variable peptide linked to a surface protein. Each phage genome encodes the variant of the protein displayed on its surface (hence the name), providing a link between the peptide variant and its encoding gene. Variant phages from the library may be selected through their binding affinity to an immobilized molecule (e.g., botulism toxin) to neutralize it. The bound, selected phages can be multiplied by reinfecting a susceptible bacterial strain, thus allowing them to retrieve the peptides encoded in them for further study.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Smith GP, Petrenko VA | title = Phage Display | journal = Chemical Reviews | volume = 97 | issue = 2 | pages = 391–410 | date = April 1997 | pmid = 11848876 | doi = 10.1021/cr960065d }}</ref>

== Replication ==
[[File:Phage injection.png|thumb|right|upright=2|Diagram of the DNA injection process]]
The life cycle of bacteriophages tends to be either a [[lytic cycle]] or a [[lysogenic cycle]]. In addition, some phages display pseudolysogenic behaviors.<ref name="Popescu">{{cite journal | vauthors = Popescu M, Van Belleghem JD, Khosravi A, Bollyky PL | title = Bacteriophages and the Immune System | journal = Annual Review of Virology | volume = 8 | issue = 1 | pages = 415–435 | date = September 2021 | pmid = 34014761 | doi = 10.1146/annurev-virology-091919-074551 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

With ''lytic phages'' such as the [[T4 phage]], bacterial cells are broken open (lysed) and destroyed after immediate replication of the virion. As soon as the cell is destroyed, the phage progeny can find new hosts to infect.<ref name="Popescu"/> Lytic phages are more suitable for [[phage therapy]]. Some lytic phages undergo a phenomenon known as lysis inhibition, where completed phage progeny will not immediately lyse out of the cell if extracellular phage concentrations are high. This mechanism is not identical to that of the [[Temperateness (virology)|temperate phage]] going dormant and usually is temporary.{{citation needed|date=October 2022}}

In contrast, the ''[[lysogenic cycle]]'' does not result in immediate lysing of the host cell. Those phages able to undergo lysogeny are known as [[temperate phage]]s. Their viral genome will integrate with host DNA and replicate along with it, relatively harmlessly, or may even become established as a [[plasmid]]. The virus remains dormant until host conditions deteriorate, perhaps due to depletion of nutrients, then, the [[endogenous]] phages (known as [[prophage]]s) become active. At this point they initiate the reproductive cycle, resulting in lysis of the host cell. As the lysogenic cycle allows the host cell to continue to survive and reproduce, the virus is replicated in all offspring of the cell. An example of a bacteriophage known to follow the lysogenic cycle and the lytic cycle is the [[phage lambda]] of ''E. coli.''<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Mason KA, Losos JB, Singer SR, Raven PH, Johnson GB | date = 2011 | title = Biology | page = 533 | publisher = McGraw-Hill | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-07-893649-4 }}</ref>

Sometimes prophages may provide benefits to the host bacterium while they are dormant by adding new functions to the bacterial [[genome]], in a phenomenon called [[lysogenic conversion]]. Examples are the conversion of harmless strains of ''[[Corynebacterium diphtheriae]]'' or ''[[Vibrio cholerae]]'' by bacteriophages to highly virulent ones that cause [[diphtheria]] or [[cholera]], respectively.<ref name="pmid19007916">{{cite journal | vauthors = Mokrousov I | title = Corynebacterium diphtheriae: genome diversity, population structure and genotyping perspectives | journal = Infection, Genetics and Evolution | volume = 9 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–15 | date = January 2009 | pmid = 19007916 | doi = 10.1016/j.meegid.2008.09.011 }}</ref><ref name="pmid21799407">{{cite journal | vauthors = Charles RC, Ryan ET | title = Cholera in the 21st century | journal = Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases | volume = 24 | issue = 5 | pages = 472–477 | date = October 2011 | pmid = 21799407 | doi = 10.1097/QCO.0b013e32834a88af | s2cid = 6907842 }}</ref> Strategies to combat certain bacterial infections by targeting these toxin-encoding prophages have been proposed.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Keen EC | title = Paradigms of pathogenesis: targeting the mobile genetic elements of disease | journal = Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology | volume = 2 | pages = 161 | date = December 2012 | pmid = 23248780 | pmc = 3522046 | doi = 10.3389/fcimb.2012.00161 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

=== Synthesis of proteins and nucleic acid ===
Within minutes, bacterial [[ribosome]]s start translating viral mRNA into protein. For RNA-based phages, [[RNA replicase]] is synthesized early in the process. Proteins modify the bacterial [[RNA polymerase]] so it preferentially transcribes viral mRNA. The host's normal synthesis of proteins and nucleic acids is disrupted, and it is forced to manufacture viral products instead. These products go on to become part of new virions within the cell, helper proteins that contribute to the assemblage of new virions, or proteins involved in cell [[lysis]].

=== Release of virions ===
Phages may be released via cell lysis, by extrusion, or, in a few cases, by budding. Lysis, by tailed phages, is achieved by an enzyme called [[endolysin]], which attacks and breaks down the cell wall [[peptidoglycan]]. An altogether different phage type, the [[filamentous phage]], makes the host cell continually secrete new virus particles. Released virions are described as free, and, unless defective, are capable of infecting a new bacterium. Budding is associated with certain ''[[Mycoplasma]]'' phages. In contrast to virion release, phages displaying a [[lysogenic]] cycle do not kill the host and instead become long-term residents as [[prophage]]s.<ref name="pmid36164818">{{cite journal | vauthors = Henrot C, Petit MA | title = Signals triggering prophage induction in the gut microbiota | journal = Molecular Microbiology | volume = 118 | issue = 5 | pages = 494–502 | date = November 2022 | pmid = 36164818 | pmc = 9827884 | doi = 10.1111/mmi.14983 | s2cid = 252542284 }}</ref>

Some marine [[roseobacter]] phages contain [[deoxyuridine]] (dU) instead of [[Thymidine|deoxythymidine]] (dT) in their genomic DNA. There is some evidence that this unusual component is a mechanism to evade bacterial defense mechanisms such as [[Restriction enzyme|restriction endonucleases]] and [[CRISPR|CRISPR/Cas]] systems which evolved to recognize and cleave sequences within invading phages, thereby inactivating them. Other phages have long been known to use unusual nucleotides. In 1963, Takahashi and Marmur identified a ''[[Bacillus]]'' phage that has dU substituting dT in its genome,<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Takahashi I, Marmur J | title = Replacement of thymidylic acid by deoxyuridylic acid in the deoxyribonucleic acid of a transducing phage for Bacillus subtilis | journal = Nature | volume = 197 | issue = 4869 | pages = 794–795 | date = February 1963 | pmid = 13980287 | doi = 10.1038/197794a0 | s2cid = 4166988 | bibcode = 1963Natur.197..794T }}</ref> and in 1977, Kirnos et al. identified a [[cyanophage]] containing 2-aminoadenine (Z) instead of adenine (A).<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kirnos MD, Khudyakov IY, Alexandrushkina NI, Vanyushin BF | title = 2-aminoadenine is an adenine substituting for a base in S-2L cyanophage DNA | journal = Nature | volume = 270 | issue = 5635 | pages = 369–370 | date = November 1977 | pmid = 413053 | doi = 10.1038/270369a0 | s2cid = 4177449 | bibcode = 1977Natur.270..369K }}</ref>

== Systems biology ==
The field of [[systems biology]] investigates the complex [[Biological network|networks of interactions]] within an organism, usually using computational tools and modeling.<ref name="Klipp_2009">{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/288986435|title=Systems biology: a textbook|date=2009|publisher=Wiley-VCH| vauthors = Klipp E |isbn=978-3-527-31874-2|location=Weinheim|oclc=288986435}}</ref> For example, a phage genome that enters into a bacterial host cell may express hundreds of phage proteins which will affect the expression of numerous host genes or the host's [[metabolism]]. All of these complex interactions can be described and simulated in computer models.<ref name="Klipp_2009" />

For instance, infection of ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'' by the temperate phage PaP3 changed the expression of 38% (2160/5633) of its host's genes. Many of these effects are probably indirect, hence the challenge becomes to identify the direct interactions among bacteria and phage.<ref name="pmid26750429">{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhao X, Chen C, Shen W, Huang G, Le S, Lu S, Li M, Zhao Y, Wang J, Rao X, Li G, Shen M, Guo K, Yang Y, Tan Y, Hu F | display-authors = 6 | title = Global Transcriptomic Analysis of Interactions between Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Bacteriophage PaP3 | journal = Scientific Reports | volume = 6 | pages = 19237 | date = January 2016 | pmid = 26750429 | pmc = 4707531 | doi = 10.1038/srep19237 | bibcode = 2016NatSR...619237Z }}</ref>

Several attempts have been made to map [[protein–protein interaction]]s among phage and their host. For instance, bacteriophage lambda was found to interact with its host, [[Escherichia coli|''E. coli'']], by dozens of interactions. Again, the significance of many of these interactions remains unclear, but these studies suggest that there most likely are several key interactions and many indirect interactions whose role remains uncharacterized.<ref name="pmid24049175">{{cite journal | vauthors = Blasche S, Wuchty S, Rajagopala SV, Uetz P | title = The protein interaction network of bacteriophage lambda with its host, Escherichia coli | journal = Journal of Virology | volume = 87 | issue = 23 | pages = 12745–12755 | date = December 2013 | pmid = 24049175 | pmc = 3838138 | doi = 10.1128/JVI.02495-13 }}</ref>

There is evidence that bacteriophages and bacteria interact in the  [[Gut microbiota|human gut microbiome]] both antagonistically and beneficially.<ref name="Kirsch"/>

Preliminary studies have indicated that common bacteriophages are found in 62% of healthy individuals on average, while their prevalence was reduced by 42% and 54% on average in patients with [[ulcerative colitis]] (UC) and [[Crohn's disease]] (CD).<ref name="Manrique_2016" /> Abundance of phages may also decline in the elderly.<ref name="Kirsch"/>

The most common phages in the human intestine, found worldwide, are [[crAssphage]]s. CrAssphages are transmitted from mother to child soon after birth, and there is some evidence suggesting that they may be transmitted locally. Each person develops their own unique crAssphage clusters.
