Many [[vaccines]] require refrigeration to remain active, and the lack of infrastructure to maintain the [[cool chain]] to reliably bring vaccines into more remote areas of developing countries poses a serious challenge to national immunization programs. Portable '''vaccine cooler''' units have been proposed by several technologists. The [[WHO]] Performance, Quality and Safety (PQS) programme is a driver of the technology.<ref name="who">{{cite web |title=E004: Insulated containers |url=http://apps.who.int/immunization_standards/vaccine_quality/pqs_catalogue/categorypage.aspx?id_cat=18 |publisher=World Health Organization}}</ref><ref name="fev">{{cite web|date=1 March 2016|title=Generic Guide for THE FIELD EVALUATION OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES for WHO PQS Prequalification|url=https://extranet.who.int/pqweb/sites/default/files/documents/Generic%20guide%20for%20field%20evaluation.pdf|access-date=5 April 2021|publisher=World Health Organization}}</ref>

In 2005 [[Ian Tansley]] of [[Sure Chill]] designed an ice-chest vaccine cooler regulated by the density of water. Since water has greatest density at around 4&nbsp;°C, putting the vaccine chamber at the bottom of a [[thermo-syphon]] regulates the temperature at between 2&nbsp;°C and 8&nbsp;°C, as long as there is ice and the heat-exchange capacity is not overloaded.{{clarify|date=August 2019}} Sure Chill claimed{{when|date=August 2019}} to be WHO approved and in use for [[vaccine storage]] in 46 countries.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}

A refrigeration device was shown for this purpose by [[Adam Grosser]] at a [[TED Talk]] in 2007,<ref name=tedag>{{cite web|url=http://www.ted.com/talks/adam_grosser_and_his_sustainable_fridge |title=A mobile fridge for vaccines |last=Grosser |first=Adam |date=2007 |publisher=TED}}</ref> but had not been produced commercially as of 2020.<ref name=bisno>{{Cite web |title=The Einstein-Szilard Refrigerator |last=Bisno |first=Adam |work=Lemelson Center for the Study of Invention and Innovation, Smithsonian Museum |date=8 December 2020 |url= https://invention.si.edu/einstein-szilard-refrigerator}}</ref> Grosser's proposed device uses exposure to a cooking fire for 30 minutes to store heat. After a cooling period of an hour, the device is placed into a 15-litre container, which contains the vaccine. His concept calls for a 24-hour re-cycle period.<ref name=tedag/>

It was revealed in March 2008 that another class of long-term Vaccine Cooler is based around an Ice Box with separate Ice and Vaccine chambers. Using ice as the energy storage device allows the Vaccine Cooler to operate for long periods without power: separating the vaccine chamber from the ice chamber allows temperature regulation while avoiding the need for special packing and conditioning of the cold packs. Suggestions have included the use of a regulated heat pipe to connect the vaccine chamber and the ice chamber.<ref>{{Cite thesis|title=Design and manufacture of low cost vaccine cooler|url=https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/40937|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|date=2007|degree=Thesis|first=Cynthia Dawn Walker|last=Panas|hdl=1721.1/40937 }}</ref>

In September 2008 it was reported that [[Malcolm McCulloch]] of [[Oxford University]] was heading a three-year project to develop more robust appliances that could be used in locales lacking electricity, and that his team had completed a prototype of his renewal of the [[Einstein refrigerator]]. He was quoted as saying that improving the design and changing the types of gases used might allow the design's efficiency to be quadrupled.<ref>{{cite news | last = Alok | first = Jha | title = Einstein fridge design can help global cooling | newspaper = [[The Guardian]] | date = 21 September 2008 | url = https://www.theguardian.com/science/2008/sep/21/scienceofclimatechange.climatechange }}</ref> The three working fluids in this design are [[water]], [[ammonia]] and [[butane]].<ref name="go">{{cite news |title=Einstein's Refrigerator Using No Electricity/No Freon Revived at Oxford |url=http://www.greenoptimistic.com/einstein-refrigerator/ |date=6 February 2015 |publisher=The Green Optimistic}}</ref>
