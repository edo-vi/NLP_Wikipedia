The '''Whitehall farces''' were a series of five long-running comic stage plays at the [[Trafalgar Studios|Whitehall Theatre]] in London, presented by the [[actor-manager]] [[Brian Rix]], in the 1950s and 1960s. They were in the [[low comedy]] tradition of British [[farce]], following the [[Aldwych farce]]s, which played at the [[Aldwych Theatre]] between 1924 and 1933.<ref>Nightingale, Benedict.

Rix built a company of regular players who appeared in some or all of these shows. They included [[Leo Franklyn]], Larry Noble, Dennis Ramsden and [[Derek Royle]],<ref>Smith, p. 97</ref> and members of Rix's family: his wife, [[Elspet Gray]], his sister, [[Sheila Mercier]] and his brother-in-law, Peter Mercier. Others who appeared in one or more of the Whitehall farces include [[Terry Scott]]<ref>Gaye, p. 100</ref> and [[Andrew Sachs]].<ref>Chapman, p. 3</ref> Rix starred in all five plays, in a range of roles: a "gormless recruit" to the army in ''Reluctant Heroes'';<ref>"Whitehall Theatre", ''The Times'', 13 September 1950, p. 6</ref> a timidly crooked [[bookie]]'s runner in ''Dry Rot'';<ref>Smith, p. 76</ref> a street musician recruited as a secret agent in ''Simple Spymen'';<ref>Chapman, ''passim''</ref> four identical brothers in ''One For the Pot'';<ref>Smith, p. 86</ref> and a harassed civil servant in ''Chase Me, Comrade''.<ref>Smith, p. 93</ref> From ''Dry Rot'' onwards, Rix and his authors developed a double act for the Rix characters and those played by Leo Franklyn, in which the two performers played off one another rather as [[Ralph Lynn]] and [[Tom Walls]] had done in the Aldwych farces of the previous generation.<ref>Smith, pp. 58, 77 and 84</ref>

Although the five plays constituting the Whitehall farces had long runs and the theatres usually had full houses, the majority of London critics were dismissive of them. Writing in the ''[[Financial Times]]'' in 1980, [[Michael Coveney]] commented: "A tradition of critical snobbery has grown up around these plays, partly because they were so blatantly popular but chiefly because of our conviction that farce, unless written by a Frenchman, is an inferior theatrical species. Once the [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]] has done its duty by [[J.B. Priestley|Priestley]] and [[Terence Rattigan|Rattigan]] and others teetering on the brink of theatrical respectability I suggest they employ Mr. Rix … to investigate the ignored riches of English farce between [[Ben Travers|Travers]] and [[Alan Ayckbourn|Ayckbourn]]."<ref>Coveney, Michael. "Simple Spymen", ''[[Financial Times]]'', 11 August 1980, p. 9</ref> Some London critics of the 1950s and 1960s did not disregard them, including [[Harold Hobson]], Ronald Bryden, J. W. Lambert and [[Alan Dent]].<ref>Smith, p. 70</ref>

===Television broadcasts; later productions===
In addition to the five long-running farces, Rix presented a series of more than eighty one-off televised comedies, some of them farces, for the [[BBC]]. The first was transmitted live from the Whitehall Theatre in January 1956.<ref>Rix, Brian. [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/apr/07/whitehall-farces-tv-theatre-relationship "The Whitehall farces had a major role in the TV-theatre relationship"], ''The Guardian'', 7 April 2010</ref> There were also film versions of ''[[Reluctant Heroes]]'' (1951), ''[[Dry Rot (film)|Dry Rot]]'' (1956), and ''Chase Me, Comrade'', which was renamed ''[[Not Now, Comrade]]'' (1976).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmovie.com/work/reluctant-heroes-107563/cast |title=Reluctant Heroes (1951) - Trailers, Reviews, Synopsis, Showtimes and Cast |publisher=AllMovie |date= |accessdate=2013-09-16}}</ref><ref name=IMDb>{{IMDb title|0155104}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/film/cdc65/dry-rot |title=Dry Rot &#124; Film review and movie reviews |work=Radio Times |date=2013-04-08 |accessdate=2014-07-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://networkonair.com/features/2013/05/09/not-now-comrade/|title=Networkonair > Features > Not Now Comrade|publisher=}}</ref>

In 1966, having been unable to secure the lease of the Whitehall Theatre, Rix took his company on tour in ''Chase Me, Comrade'' and ''Bang, Bang Beirut'' (later retitled ''Stand By Your Bedouin''), by Cooney and Hilton.<ref>Smith, p. 96</ref> Later productions by the Rix company at the [[Garrick Theatre]] and elsewhere included ''Uproar in the House'' (1967), by [[Anthony Marriott]] and Alistair Foot; ''Let Sleeping Wives Lie'' (also 1967) by Harold Brooke and [[Kay Bannerman]]; ''[[She's Done It Again (play)|She's Done It Again]]'' (1969), by [[Michael Pertwee]]; ''Don't Just Lie There, Say Something'' (Pertwee, 1971); and ''A Bit Between the Teeth'' (Pertwee, 1974). According to Leslie Smith in a study of modern British farce, although some of the Rix productions after ''Chase Me, Comrade'' achieved substantial success, none of them had the conspicuously long runs of the five Whitehall farces.<ref>Smith, pp. 97–98</ref> In 1976, Rix returned to the Whitehall with ''Fringe Benefits'' ([[Donald Churchill]] and Cooney)  which ran until 1977 when he retired from the stage.
