{{Spatial anomalies in fiction}}
In [[science fiction]], '''hyperspace''' (also known as '''nulspace''', '''subspace''', '''overspace''', '''jumpspace''' and similar terms) is a concept relating to [[dimension#Additional dimensions|higher dimensions]] as well as [[parallel universes in fiction|parallel universes]] and a [[faster-than-light]] (FTL) method of [[interstellar travel]]. Its use in science fiction originated in the magazine ''[[Amazing Stories Quarterly]]'' in 1931 and within several decades it became one of the most popular [[Trope (literature)|tropes]] of science fiction, popularized by its use in the works of authors such as [[Isaac Asimov]] and [[Edwin Charles Tubb|E. C. Tubb]], and media franchises such as ''[[Star Wars]]''.

One of the main reasons for the concept's popularity is the impossibility of faster-than-light travel in ordinary space, which hyperspace allows writers to bypass. In most works, hyperspace is described as a higher dimension through which the shape of our [[three-dimensional space]] can be distorted to bring distant points close to each other, similar to the concept of a [[wormhole]]; or a shortcut-enabling [[Parallel universes in fiction|parallel universe]] that can be travelled through. Usually it can be traversed – the process often known as "jumping" – through a gadget known as a "hyperdrive"; [[rubber science]] is sometimes used to explain it. Many works rely on hyperspace as a convenient background tool enabling FTL travel necessary for the plot, with a small minority making it a central element in their storytelling. While most often used in the context of interstellar travel, a minority of works focus on other plot points, such as the inhabitants of hyperspace, hyperspace as an energy source, or even hyperspace as the [[afterlife]].

The term occasionally appears in scientific works in related contexts.

The basic premise of hyperspace is that vast distances through space can be traversed quickly by taking a kind of shortcut. There are two common models used to explain this shortcut: folding and mapping. In the folding model, hyperspace is a place of higher dimension through which the shape of our [[three-dimensional space]] can be distorted to bring distant points close to each other; a common analogy popularized by [[Robert A. Heinlein]]'s ''[[Starman Jones]]'' (1953) is that of crumpling two-dimensional paper or cloth in the third dimension, thus bringing points on its surface into contact. In the mapping model, hyperspace is a [[Parallel universes in fiction|parallel universe]] much smaller than ours (but not necessarily the same shape), which can be entered at a point corresponding to one location in ordinary space and exited at a different point corresponding to another location after travelling a much shorter distance than would be necessary in ordinary space. ''[[The Science in Science Fiction]]'' compares it to being able to step onto a [[world map]] at one's current location, walking across the map to a different continent, and then stepping off the map to find oneself at the new location—noting that the hyperspace "map" could have a significantly more complicated shape, as in [[Bob Shaw]]'s ''[[Night Walk (novel)|Night Walk]]'' (1967).<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|title=Hyperspace|url=https://sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/hyperspace|access-date=5 November 2021|website=[[The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction]]}}</ref><ref name=":3">{{Cite book|last=Langford|first=David|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LRb8X7Ust_oC&q=hyperspace|title=The Science in Science Fiction|date=1983|publisher=Knopf|isbn=978-0-394-53010-9|editor-last=Nicholls|editor-first=Peter|language=en|chapter=Hyperspace|editor-last2=Langford|editor-first2=David|editor-last3=Stableford|editor-first3=Brian M.|chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/scienceinscience00nich/page/72/mode/2up}}</ref>{{Rp|72–73}}<ref name=":8" />{{Rp|175}}<ref name="Westfahl2005" />{{rp|404}}

C.

He was also one of the first writers to treat hyperspace as a central part of the plot rather than a convenient background gadget that just enables the faster-than-light space travel.<ref name=":6" /><ref name="visual" />{{Rp|75}}

In 1963, [[Philip Harbottle]] called the concept of hyperspace "a fixture" of the science fiction genre,<ref name=":6" /> and in 1977 [[Brian Ash (bibliographer)|Brian Ash]] wrote in ''[[The Visual Encyclopedia of Science Fiction]]'' that it had become the most popular of all faster-than-light methods of travel.<ref name="visual" />{{Rp|75}} The concept would subsequently be further popularized through its use in the ''[[Star Wars]]'' franchise.<ref name=":2" />

In the 1974 film ''[[Dark Star (film)|Dark Star]]'', special effects designer [[Dan O'Bannon]] created a visual effect to depict going into hyperspace wherein the stars in space appear to move rapidly toward the camera. This is considered to be the first depiction in cinema history of a ship making the jump into hyperspace. The same effect was later employed in ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' (1977) and the "star streaks" are considered one of the visual "staples" of the ''Star Wars'' franchise.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Taylor|first=Chris|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z7GbBAAAQBAJ&dq=%22dark%20star%22%20special%20effects%20hyperspace&pg=PT115|title=How Star Wars Conquered the Universe: The Past, Present, and Future of a Multibillion Dollar Franchise|date=2014|publisher=Head of Zeus|isbn=978-1-78497-045-1|language=en|access-date=5 January 2021}}</ref>{{rp|115}}<ref>{{Cite web|last=Howell|first=Elizabeth|date=12 December 2017|title=Warp Speed: The Hype of Hyperspace|url=https://www.space.com/32712-warp-drive-hyperspace.html|access-date=5 November 2021|website=Space.com|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Muir|first=John Kenneth|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GoWNAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA189|title=A History and Critical Analysis of Blake's 7, the 1978-1981 British Television Space Adventure|date=2015-09-15|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-1-4766-0493-0|language=en}}</ref>{{rp|189}}

== Characteristics ==<!--Section title used as anchor for Redirect [[Underspace]: please amend there if altering-->

Hyperspace is typically described as chaotic and confusing to human senses; often at least unpleasant – transitions to or from hyperspace can cause symptoms such as [[nausea]], for example – and in some cases even [[hypnotic]] or dangerous to one's sanity.<ref name=":6" /><ref name="Stableford20063" />{{Rp|238–239}}<ref name="Westfahl2005" />{{rp|405}} Visually, hyperspace is often left to the reader's imagination, or depicted as "a swirling gray mist".<ref name="visual" />{{Rp|75}}<ref name=":6" /> In some works, it is dark.<ref name="Westfahl2005" />{{rp|405}} Exceptions exist; for example, [[John Russell Fearn|John Russel Fearn]]'s ''Waters of Eternity'' (1953) features hyperspace that allows observation of regular space from within.<ref name=":6" />

Many stories feature hyperspace as a dangerous, treacherous place where straying from a preset course can be disastrous. In [[Frederick Pohl]]'s ''[[The Mapmakers (novel)|The Mapmakers]]'' (1955), navigational errors and the perils of hyperspace are one of the main plot-driving elements,<ref name=":3" />{{Rp|72–73}}<ref name="visual" />{{Rp|75}} and in [[John Brunner (novelist)|K. Houston Brunner]]'s ''[[Fiery Pillar]]'' (1955), a ship re-emerges within Earth, causing a catastrophic explosion.<ref name="visual" />{{Rp|75}} In some works, travelling or navigating hyperspace requires not only specialized equipment, but physical or psychological modifications of passengers or at least navigators, as seen in [[Frank Herbert]]'s ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'' (1965), [[Michael Moorcock]]'s ''[[The Sundered Worlds]]'' (1966), [[Vonda N. McIntyre|Vonda McIntyre]]'s ''[[Aztecs (novel)|Aztecs]]'' (1977), and [[David Brin]]'s ''[[The Warm Space]]'' (1985).<ref name="Stableford20063" />

While generally associated with science fiction, hyperspace-like concepts exist in some works of [[fantasy]], particularly ones which involve movement between different worlds or dimensions. Such travel, usually done through portals rather than vehicles, is usually explained through the existence of [[Magic (supernatural)|magic]].<ref name="Westfahl2005" />{{rp|405}}

== Use ==
While mainly designed as means of fast space travel, occasionally, some writers have used the hyperspace concept in more imaginative ways, or as a central element of the story.<ref name=":3" />{{Rp|72–73}} In [[Arthur C.
