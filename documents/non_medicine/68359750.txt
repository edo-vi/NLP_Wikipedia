The book was drafted as a preface to [[Jiang Baili|Jiang Fangzhen]]'s ''History of the European Renaissance Times'', but because of its length, it became a separate book.<ref>{{cite book|title=Dictionary of Logic|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ttAtAAAAYAAJ|year=2004|publisher=Shanghai Lexicographical Publishing House|isbn=978-7-5326-1663-3}}</ref> It systematically outlines the development of Chinese academic thought from the end of the [[Ming Dynasty]] to the beginning of the 20th century, over a period of more than 200 years.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Encyclopedia of Chinese Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oCCGAAAAIAAJ|year=1994|publisher=Changchun Publishing House|isbn=978-7-80573-879-6}}</ref> In it, Liang compared the [[European Renaissance]] with the development of academic thought in the Qing dynasty, and discussed the content and historical significance of the Renaissance.<ref>{{cite book|title=Western Thought in Modern China|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fm1bAAAAIAAJ|year=2005|publisher=Social Sciences Literature Press|isbn=978-7-80190-848-3}}</ref> He asserted that the key difference between them lay in the underdevelopment of literature and fine art in the Qing.<ref name="Wang2020"/>

The book was translated into English by [[Immanuel C. Y. Hsu]] and published by [[Harvard University Press]] in 1959 with an Introduction by [[Benjamin I. Schwartz]]. Hsu translated the title as ''Intellectual Trends in the Ch'ing Period''.<ref name="Woolf2014">{{cite book|author=D.R.

This book revealed the academic situation in China between 1664 and 1911, and thus changed the perception of "unchanging China" in the Western mind, thus opening the door for Western scholars and students to understand modern Chinese history.<ref>{{cite book|title=West meets East: 50 Years of My American Journey in Academia and Cultures|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s083EAAAQBAJ&pg=PA45|publisher=Joint Publishing (Hong Kong) Company Limited|isbn=978-962-04-4785-3|pages=45–|author=Edwin Pak-wah Leung}}</ref>
