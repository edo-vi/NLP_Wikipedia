The '''Dorn method''' is a form of manual, [[Holism#Holism in medicine|holistic]] [[Alternative medicine|alternative therapy]] used to correct misalignments in the [[Vertebral column|spinal column]] and other [[joint]]s.

During a treatment, the practitioner palpates the patient's spine. If any 'unbalanced' areas are found, possible underlying misalignments are palpated with gentle pressure using the thumb or hand against the [[spinous process]]es, while the patient enacts guided movements such as swinging the leg or arms to distract the muscles' inertia; this is similar to the principle of mechanics known as 'counter pressure'.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://ph.88db.com/ph/html/lifestyle/feature_health_dorn_method.htm|title=Healing Hands|publisher=[[88DB.com.ph]] Lifestyle Magazine|author=Romina Tobias|date=2009-01-09|accessdate=2009-10-05|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120712203254/http://ph.88db.com/ph/html/lifestyle/feature_health_dorn_method.htm|archivedate=2012-07-12}}</ref> In case of pain, the patient is advised to stop the procedure in order to avoid any damage to the body.
