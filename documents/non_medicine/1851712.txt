A '''film adaptation''' is the transfer of a work or story, in whole or in part, to a feature film. Although often considered a type of derivative work, film adaptation has been conceptualized recently by academic scholars such as [[Robert Stam]] as a [[dialogic process]].

While the most common form of film adaptation is the use of a novel as the basis, other works adapted into films include non-fiction (including journalism), autobiographical works, comic books, scriptures, plays, historical sources and even other films. Adaptation from such diverse resources has been a ubiquitous practice of filmmaking since the earliest days of cinema in nineteenth-century Europe. In contrast to when making a remake, movie directors usually take more creative liberties when creating a film adaptation.

==Elision and interpolation==

In 1924, Erich von Stroheim attempted a literal adaptation of [[Frank Norris]]'s novel ''[[McTeague]]'' with his film ''[[Greed (1924 film)|Greed]].'' The resulting film was 9½ hours long, and was cut to four hours at studio insistence. It was then cut again (without Stroheim's input) to around two hours. The result was a film that was largely incoherent. Since that time, few directors have attempted to put everything in a novel into a film. Therefore, [[wikt:elision|elision]] is all but essential.

In some cases, film adaptations also interpolate scenes or invent characters. This is especially true when a novel is part of a literary saga. Incidents or quotations from later or earlier novels will be inserted into a single film. Additionally and far more controversially, filmmakers will invent new characters or create stories that were not present in the source material at all. Given the anticipated audience for a film, the screenwriter, director or movie studio may wish to increase character time or to invent new characters. For example, William J. Kennedy's [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning novel ''[[Ironweed (novel)|Ironweed]]'' included a short appearance by a prostitute named Helen. Because the film studio anticipated a female audience for the film and had Meryl Streep for the role, Helen became a significant part of the film. However, characters are also sometimes invented to provide the narrative voice.

==Interpretation as adaptation==

There have been several notable cases of massive inventive adaptation, including the Roland Joffe adaptation of ''[[The Scarlet Letter]]'' with explicit sex between Hester Prynn and the minister and Native American obscene puns into a major character and the film's villain. The Charlie Kaufman and "Donald Kaufman" penned ''[[Adaptation (film)|Adaptation]]'', credited as an adaptation of the novel ''[[The Orchid Thief]]'', was an intentional satire and commentary on the process of film adaptation itself. All of those are cases of Nathaniel Hawthorne's point. The creators of the ''Gulliver's Travels'' [[Gulliver's Travels (miniseries)|miniseries]] interpolated a sanity trial to reflect the ongoing scholarly debate over whether or not Gulliver himself is sane at the conclusion of Book IV. In those cases, adaptation is a form of criticism and recreation as well as translation.

Change is essential and practically unavoidable, mandated both by the constraints of time and medium, but how much is always a balance. Some film theorists have argued that a director should be entirely unconcerned with the source, as a novel is a novel and a film is a film, and the two works of art must be seen as separate entities. Since a transcription of a novel into film is impossible, even holding up a goal of "accuracy" is absurd. Others argue that what a film adaptation does is change to fit (literally, adapt), and the film must be accurate to the effect (aesthetics), the theme, or the message of a novel and that the filmmaker must introduce changes, if necessary, to fit the demands of time and to maximize faithfulness along one of those axes.

In most cases adaptation, the films are required to create identities (for example, a characters' costume or set decor) since they are not specified in the original material. Then, the influence of film-makers may go unrecognized because there is no comparison in the original material even though the new visual identities will affect narrative interpretation. [[Peter Jackson]]'s adaptations of [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' trilogy]] and ''[[The Hobbit (film series)|The Hobbit]]'' by author [[JRR Tolkien]] represent an unusual case since many visual and stylistic details were specified by Tolkien. For the [[Harry Potter (film series)|''Harry Potter'' film series]], author [[JK Rowling]] was closely consulted by the filmmakers, and she provided production designer [[Stuart Craig]] with a map of [[Hogwarts]]' grounds and also prevented director [[Alfonso Cuarón]] from adding a graveyard scene because the graveyard would appear elsewhere in a later novel.

An often overlooked aspect of film adaptation is the inclusion of sound and music. In a literary text, a specific sound effect can often be implied or specified by an event, but in the process of adaptation, filmmakers must determine specific the sound characteristics that subliminally affects narrative interpretation. In some cases of adaptation, music may have been specified in the original material (usually [[Diegesis|diegetic]] music). In [[Stephenie Meyer]]'s 2005 ''[[Twilight (Meyer novel)|Twilight]]'' novel, the characters [[Edward Cullen]] and [[Bella Swan]] both listen to Debussy's [[Debussy's Claire de Lune|''Clair de lune'']] and Edward composes the piece ''Bella's Lullaby'' for Bella. While ''Clair de lune'' was a pre-existing piece of music, ''Bella's Lullaby'' was not and required original music to be composed for the 2008 [[The Twilight Saga (film series)|movie adaptation]].

In the 2016 sci-fi film ''[[2BR02B: To Be or Naught to Be]]'' adapted from the story by [[Kurt Vonnegut]], the film-makers decided to abandon Vonnegut's choice of music. They stated that they felt that it worked in his prose only because it was not actually heard. Filmmakers' test screenings found that Vonnegut's style of music confused audiences and detracted from narrative comprehension. The film's composer, [[Leon Coward]], stated, "You can try to be as true to Vonnegut's material as possible, but at the end of the day also you’re working with the material that you as a team have generated, not just Vonnegut's, and that’s what you've got to make work."<ref name=Schubertian>{{cite journal |last=Black|first=Anna|title=''"...for a father hear a child!"''

==Theatrical adaptation==
{{see also|List of plays adapted into feature films|Stage-to-film adaptation}}
Stage plays are frequent sources for film adaptations.

Many of [[William Shakespeare]]'s plays, including ''[[Hamlet]]'', ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'', and ''[[Othello]]'', have been adapted into films.  The first sound adaptation of any Shakespeare play was the [[The Taming of the Shrew (1929 film)|1929 production]] of ''The Taming of the Shrew'', starring [[Mary Pickford]] and [[Douglas Fairbanks]].<ref name="Barnet">{{cite book | last=Barnet | first=Sylvan | author-link=Sylvan Barnet | chapter=''The Shrew'' on Stage and Screen | editor-last=Heilman | editor-first=Robert B. | editor-link=Robert B.

''The Taming of the Shrew'' was again retold in 1999 as a teen comedy set in a high school in ''[[10 Things I Hate about You]]'', and also in 2003 as an urban romantic comedy, ''[[Deliver Us from Eva]]''. The 1961 musical film ''[[West Side Story (1961 film)|West Side Story]]'' was adapted from ''Romeo and Juliet'', with its first incarnation as a Broadway musical play that opened in 1957. The animated film ''[[The Lion King]]'' (1994) was inspired by ''Hamlet'' as well as various traditional African myths, and 2001's '' [[O (film)|O]]'' was based on ''Othello''.

Film adaptations of Shakespeare's works in languages other than English are numerous, including Akira Kurosawa's films ''Throne of Blood'' (1957, an epic film version of ''Macbeth''), '' [[The Bad Sleep Well]]'' (1960, inspired by ''Hamlet'') and ''Ran'' (1985, based on ''King Lear''); and [[Vishal Bhardwaj]]'s  "Shakespearean trilogy" consisting of '' [[Haider (film)|Haider]]'' (2014, a retelling of ''Hamlet''), ''[[Omkara (2006 film)|Omkara]]'' (2006, based on ''Othello'') and ''[[Maqbool]]'' (2003, based on ''Macbeth'').

Another way in which Shakespearean texts have been incorporated in films is to feature characters who are either actors performing those texts or characters who are somehow influenced or effected by seeing one of Shakespeare's plays, within a larger non-Shakespearean story.  Generally, Shakespeare's basic themes or certain elements of the plot will parallel the main plot of the film or become part of a character's development in some way.  Hamlet and Romeo and Juliet are the two plays which have most often been used in this way.<ref>McKernan, Luke and Terris, Olwen (eds.) ''Walking Shadows: Shakespeare in the National Film and Television Archive'' (British Film Institute Publishing, 1994).  The authors list 45 uses of ''Hamlet'' which do not include films of the play itself, on pp.45-66. They list 39 such instances for ''Romeo and Juliet'' on pp.141-156, and 23 uses of ''Othello'', on pp.119-131.</ref> [[Éric Rohmer]]'s 1992 film ''[[Conte d'hiver]]'' (''A Tale of Winter'') is one example.  Rohmer uses one scene from Shakepeare's ''[[A Winter's Tale]]'' as a major plot device within a story that is not based on the play at all.

In Britain, where stage plays tend to be more popular as a form of entertainment than currently in the United States, many films began as a stage productions.  Some British films and British/American collaborations that were based on successful British plays include ''[[Gaslight (1940 film)|Gaslight]]'' (1940), ''[[Blithe Spirit (1945 film)|Blithe Spirit]]'' (1945), ''[[Rope (film)|Rope]]'' (1948), ''[[Look Back in Anger (1959 film)|Look Back in Anger]]'' (1959), ''[[Oh! What a Lovely War]]'' (1969), ''[[Sleuth (1972 film)|Sleuth]]'' (1972), ''[[The Rocky Horror Picture Show]]'' (1975), ''[[Shirley Valentine (film)|Shirley Valentine]]'' (1989), ''[[The Madness of King George]]'' (1994), ''[[The History Boys (film)|The History Boys]]'' (2006), '' [[Quartet (2012 film)|Quartet]]'' (2012), and ''[[The Lady in the Van]]'' (2015).

Similarly, hit Broadway plays are often adapted into films, whether from musicals or dramas. Some examples of American film adaptations based on successful Broadway plays are ''[[Arsenic and Old Lace (film)|Arsenic and Old Lace]]'' (1944), ''[[Born Yesterday (1950 film)|Born Yesterday]]'' (1950), ''[[Harvey (1950 film)|Harvey]]'' (1950), ''[[A Streetcar Named Desire (1951 film)|A Streetcar Named Desire]]'' (1951), ''[[The Odd Couple (film)|The Odd Couple]]'' (1968), ''[[The Boys in the Band (1970 film)|The Boys in the Band]]'' (1970), ''[[Agnes of God (film)|Agnes of God]]'' (1985), ''[[Children of a Lesser God (film)|Children of a Lesser God]]'' (1986), [[Glengarry Glen Ross (film)|''Glengarry Glen Ross'']] (1992), ''[[Real Women Have Curves]]'' (2002), ''[[Rabbit Hole (2010 film)|Rabbit Hole]]'' (2010), and ''[[Fences (film)|Fences]]'' (2016).

On one hand, theatrical adaptation does not involve as many interpolations or elisions as novel adaptation, but on the other, the demands of scenery and possibilities of motion frequently entail changes from one medium to the other. Film critics will often mention if an adapted play has a static camera or emulates a proscenium arch. Laurence Olivier consciously imitated the arch with his ''Henry V'' (1944), having the camera begin to move and to use color stock after the prologue, indicating the passage from physical to imaginative space. Sometimes, the adaptive process can continue after one translation. Mel Brooks' ''The Producers'' began as a film in 1967, was adapted into a Broadway musical in 2001, and then adapted again in 2005 as a musical film.

==Television adaptation==
Feature films are occasionally created from television series or television segments, or vice versa, a television series will derive from a film, such as in the case of ''[[Bates Motel (TV series)|Bates Motel]]'' and ''[[Chucky (TV series)|Chucky]]''. In the former, the film will offer a longer storyline than the usual television program's format and/or expanded production values. During the 1970s, many UK television series were turned into films including ''[[Dad's Army (1971 film)|Dad's Army]]'', ''[[On the Buses (film)|On the Buses]]'', ''[[Steptoe and Son (film)|Steptoe and Son]]'' and ''[[Porridge (film)|Porridge]]''. In 1979, ''[[The Muppet Movie]]'' was a big success. In the adaptation of ''[[The X-Files]]'' to film, greater effects and a longer plotline were involved. Additionally, adaptations of television shows will offer the viewer the opportunity to see the television show's characters without broadcast restrictions. These additions (nudity, profanity, explicit drug use, and explicit violence) are only rarely a featured adaptive addition (film versions of "procedurals" such as ''[[Miami Vice]]'' are most inclined to such additions as featured adaptations) – ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]'' is a notable example of a film being more explicit than its parent TV series.

At the same time, some theatrically released films are adaptations of television miniseries events. When national film boards and state-controlled television networks co-exist, filmmakers can sometimes create very long films for television that they may adapt solely for time for theatrical release. Both [[Ingmar Bergman]] (notably with ''[[Fanny and Alexander]]'' but with other films as well) and [[Lars von Trier]] have created long television films that they then recut for international distribution.

Even segments of television series have been adapted into feature films. The American television sketch comedy show ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' has been the origin of a number of films, beginning with ''[[The Blues Brothers (film)|The Blues Brothers]]'', which began as a one-off performance by [[Dan Aykroyd]] and [[John Belushi]].

==Radio adaptation==
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}Radio narratives have also provided the basis of film adaptation. In the heyday of radio, radio segments were often translated to film, usually as shorts. Radio series turned into film series include ''[[Dr. Christian]]'', ''[[Crime Doctor (radio program)|Crime Doctor]]'' and ''[[The Whistler]]''. Dialog-heavy stories and fantastic stories from radio were also adapted to film (e.g. ''[[Fibber McGee and Molly]]'' and ''[[The Life of Riley]]''). ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (radio series)|The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'' began as a radio series for the [[BBC]] and then became a [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (novel)|novel]] that was adapted to [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film)|film]].

==Comic book adaptation==
{{see also|List of films based on comics}}
American [[comic book]] characters, particularly [[superhero]]es, have long been adapted into film, beginning in the 1940s with Saturday movie serials aimed at children. ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]'' (1978) and ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'' (1989) are two later successful movie adaptations of famous comic book characters. In the Philippines, superhero comics have been adapted numerous times into films such as ''[[Darna (1951 film)|Darna]]'' (1951), ''[[Captain Barbell#Film adaptations|Captain Barbell]]'' (1964), and ''[[Lastikman#Films|Lastik Man]]'' (1965). In addition, comics of various genres other than those involving superheroes such as romance,<ref name="MSDiaz">{{cite news|last=Diaz|first=Lav|authorlink=Lav Diaz|title=Kuwentong seks|trans-title=Sex story|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=8cBNEdFwSQkC&dat=19881231&printsec=frontpage&hl=en|accessdate=August 24, 2020|work=[[Manila Standard]]|publisher=Manila Standard News, Inc.|date=December 31, 1988|page=16|language=Filipino|quote=Eksplusibong dramang hango sa komiks ang ''Magkano...''}}</ref> fantasy<ref>{{cite news|last=Lo|first=Ricky|title=How Carlo J. created Panday|url=https://www.philstar.com/entertainment/2005/04/04/272605/how-carlo-j-created-panday|accessdate=June 13, 2020|work=[[The Philippine Star|Philstar.com]]|publisher=Philstar Global Corp.|date=April 4, 2005}}</ref> and drama<ref>{{cite news|last=Paculan|first=Virgie|title='Our movies have not changed...' – Lupita Kashiwahara|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=rJAtAAAAIBAJ&sjid=UAsEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6723%2C3703056|access-date=January 15, 2023|work=[[Manila Standard]]|publisher=Standard Publications, Inc.|date=February 26, 1988|page=11}}</ref> have widely been used as a source for film adaptations such as ''[[Roberta (1951 film)|Roberta]]'' (1951), ''[[Dyesebel#Films|Dyesebel]]'' (1953), ''[[Ang Panday (1980 film)|Ang Panday]]'' (1980), ''[[Bituing Walang Ningning (film)|Bituing Walang Ningning]]'' (1985) and ''[[Bondying#Films|Mars Ravelo's Bondying: The Little Big Boy]]'' (1989). In the early 2000s, [[Blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbusters]] such as ''[[X-Men (film)|X-Men]]'' (2000) and ''[[Spider-Man (2002 film)|Spider-Man]]'' (2002) have led to dozens of superhero films. The success of these films has also led to other comic books not necessarily about superheroes being adapted for the big screen, such as ''[[Ghost World (film)|Ghost World]]'' (2001), ''[[From Hell (film)|From Hell]]'' (2001), ''[[American Splendor (film)|American Splendor]]'' (2003), ''[[Sin City (film)|Sin City]]'' (2005), ''[[300 (film)|300]]'' (2007), ''[[Wanted (2008 film)|Wanted]]'' (2008), and ''[[Whiteout (2009 film)|Whiteout]]'' (2009).

The adaptation process for comics is different from that of novels. Many successful comic book series last for several decades and have featured several variations of the characters in that time. Films based on such series usually try to capture the back story and “spirit” of the character instead of adapting a particular storyline. Occasionally, aspects of the characters and their origins are simplified or modernized.

Self-contained graphic novels, and miniseries many of which do not feature superheroes, can be adapted more directly, such as in the case of ''[[Road to Perdition]]'' (2002) or ''[[V for Vendetta (film)|V for Vendetta]]'' (2006). In particular, Robert Rodriguez did not use a screenplay for ''Sin City'' but utilized actual panels from writer/artist Frank Miller's series as storyboards to create what Rodriguez regards as a "translation" rather than an adaptation.

Furthermore, some films based on long-running franchises use particular story lines from the franchise as a basis for a plot. The [[X2 (film)|second X-Men film]] was loosely based on the graphic novel ''[[X-Men: God Loves, Man Kills]]'' and the [[X-Men: The Last Stand|third film]] on the storyline "[[The Dark Phoenix Saga]]". ''[[Spider-Man 2]]'' was based on the storyline "Spider-Man No More!" Likewise, ''[[Batman Begins]]'' owes many of its elements to Miller's ''[[Batman: Year One]]'' and the film's sequel, ''[[The Dark Knight]]'', uses subplots from ''[[Batman: The Long Halloween]]''.

The [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] starting in 2008 is a [[shared universe]] with films combining characters from different works by [[Marvel Comics]]. The [[DC Extended Universe]] starting in 2013 uses the same model for [[DC Comics]].

{{main|Tie-in#Video game}}
Tie-in video games with films or other properties have existed since home consoles and arcade games of the early 1980s.

Video games have also been adapted into films, beginning in the early 1980s. Films closely related to the computer and video game industries were also done in this time, such as ''[[Tron]]'' and ''[[Cloak & Dagger (1984 film)|Cloak & Dagger]]'', but only after the release of several films based on well-known brands has this genre become recognized in its own right. Video game films can take several forms, such as live-action works like ''[[Super Mario Bros. (film)|Super Mario Bros.]]'', traditionally animated such as films based on the ''[[Pokémon]]'' franchise, or computer-animated such as ''[[Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within]]''. There also exist [[original video animation]]s (OVAs) based on popular games, such as ''[[Street Fighter Alpha: The Animation]]''.

Similar to comic book-based films in the past (especially from 1980s), films based on video games tend to carry a reputation of lackluster quality and receive negative reaction from both film critics and fans of the source material.<ref name="cnbc vg films"/> This is generally due to difficulties in adopting a story meant to be played interactively into a linear movie-going experience.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/10/detective-pikachu-poised-for-record-breaking-open-despite-poor-reviews.html | title = 'Detective Pikachu' doesn't escape the pitfalls of previous video game adaptations but is poised for a record-breaking opening weekend | first =Sarah | last = Whitten | date = May 10, 2019 | access-date = February 16, 2020 | work = [[CNBC]] }}</ref> Some, such as ''Super Mario Bros.'', were particularly negatively received and are considered among the [[List of films considered the worst|worst films ever made]].

Another likely reason for the failure of video game adaptations is that structural conversion from video game to film format can be challenging for filmmakers. [[Shigeru Miyamoto]], creator of [[Nintendo]] franchises including ''[[Mario (franchise)|Mario]]'' and ''[[The Legend of Zelda|Zelda]]'', said in a 2007 interview:
{{blockquote|I think that part of the problem with translating games to movies is that the structure of what makes a good game is very different from the structure of what makes a good movie. Movies are a much more passive medium, where the movie itself is telling a story and you, as the viewer, are relaxing and taking that in passively. Whereas video games are a much more active medium where you are playing along with the story. ... I think that video games, as a whole, have a very simple flow in terms of what’s going on in the game. We make that flow entertaining by implementing many different elements to the video game to keep the player entertained. Movies have much more complex stories, or flow, to them, but the elements that affect that flow are limited in number. So I think that because these surrounding elements in these two different mediums vary so greatly, when you fail to take that into account then you run into problems.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.next-gen.biz/features/miyamoto-interview|title=Miyamoto: The Interview|publisher=[[Edge Magazine]]|date=November 27, 2007|access-date=August 9, 2010|url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120503102141/http://www.edge-online.com/features/miyamoto-interview|archive-date=May 3, 2012}}</ref>}}

In an interview with ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' in August 2015, Miyamoto said, "Because games and movies seem like similar mediums, people’s natural expectation is we want to take our games and turn them into movies. … I’ve always felt video games, being an interactive medium, and movies, being a passive medium, mean the two are quite different."<ref>{{cite web|last=Morris|first=Chris|title=Shigeru Miyamoto Talks Nintendo's Return to the Movie World|url=http://fortune.com/2015/08/21/nintendo-movie-partnerships/|website=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]|access-date=3 April 2018|date=August 21, 2015}}</ref>

Until 2019, no video game film – live-action or animated – had received a [[Rotten Tomatoes]] "fresh" rating, with a score over 60%.

Following these films, new adaptions of games into films and television series became successful and showed that adaptions that held to a game's story but did not try to maintain the video game aspects were more popular with audiences. Shows such as ''[[Arcane (TV series)|Arcane]]'', ''[[Cyberpunk: Edgerunners]]'', and ''[[The Last of Us (TV series)|The Last of Us]]'' were all critically-praised series based on video games from 2021 through 2023.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/01/02/can-the-last-of-us-break-the-curse-of-bad-video-game-adaptations | title = Can "The Last of Us" Break the Curse of Bad Video-Game Adaptations? | first = Alex | last = Barasch | date = December 26, 2022 | accessdate = January 15, 2023 | work = [[New Yorker (magazine)|New Yorker]] }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.pastemagazine.com/games/the-last-of-us-and-videogame-adaptations/ | title = A Conversation about the Conversation about Videogame Adaptations | first = Mik | last = Deitz | date = January 13, 2023 | accessdate = January 15, 2023 | work = [[Paste (magazine)|Paste]] }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/for-sony-the-last-of-us-is-just-the-start-11674735415 | title = 'The Last of Us' Is Just the Start for Sony | first = Jacky | last = Wong | date = January 26, 2023 | accessdate = January 28, 2023 | work = [[The Wall Street Journal]] }}</ref>

Though video game films are critically panned, they tend to do well from the international take at box offices. ''[[Warcraft (film)|Warcraft]]'', based on the ''[[World of Warcraft]]'' game, holds the highest take of any video game adaptation with {{USD|433.6 million}}, while the six ''[[Resident Evil (film series)|Resident Evil]]'' films hold the highest take for a series of {{USD|1.2 billion}} on an average production budget between {{USD|30 to 50 million}}.<ref name="cnbc vg films"/> Other financially successful video game films include: ''[[Mortal Kombat (2021 film)|Mortal Kombat]]'', ''[[Lara Croft: Tomb Raider]]'', ''[[Uncharted (film)|Uncharted]]'', ''[[Assassin's Creed (film)|Assassin's Creed]]'', ''[[Silent Hill (film)|Silent Hill]]'',  and ''[[Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time (film)|Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time]]''.<ref name="cnbc vg films"/>

Among the most well-known video game filmmakers is [[Uwe Boll]], a German writer, director, and producer whose works include ''[[House of the Dead (film)|House of the Dead]]'', ''[[Alone in the Dark (2005 film)|Alone in the Dark]]'', ''[[BloodRayne (film)|BloodRayne]]'', ''[[In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale]]'', ''[[Postal (film)|Postal]]'', and ''[[Far Cry (film)|Far Cry]]'', all of which were almost universally panned by critics. In 2016, he retired from filmmaking, citing market failures and funding difficulties.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metronews.ca/entertainment/2016/10/20/director-uwe-boll-rampage-of-terrible-films-is-finished.html|title='The market is dead': Schlock director Uwe Boll's Rampage of terrible films is finished|publisher=[[Metro News]]|access-date=2019-09-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161027054613/http://www.metronews.ca/entertainment/2016/10/20/director-uwe-boll-rampage-of-terrible-films-is-finished.html|archive-date=2016-10-27|url-status=dead}}</ref> Similarly, [[Paul W.

==Adaptations from other sources==
{{category see also|Films based on works}}
While documentary films have often been made from journalism and reportage, so too have some dramatic films, including: ''All the President's Men'' (1976, adapted from the 1974 book); ''Miracle,'' (2004, from an account published shortly after the 1980 "miracle on ice"); and ''Pushing Tin'' (1999, from a 1996 ''New York Times'' article by Darcy Frey). ''An Inconvenient Truth'' is [[Al Gore]]'s film adaptation of his own Keynote multimedia presentation. The 2011 independent comedy film, ''Benjamin Sniddlegrass and the Cauldron of Penguins'' was based on ''Kermode and Mayo's Film Review'' of ''Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The Lightning Thief''.

Films adapted from songs include ''Coward of the County'', ''Ode to Billy Joe'', ''Convoy'', and ''Pretty Baby'' (each from a song of the same name).

Films based on toys include the Transformers franchise and the G.I. Joe films; there is a longer history of animated television series being created simultaneous to toy lines as a marketing tool. Hasbro's plans to for films based on their board games began with 2012's ''Battleship''. While amusement park rides have often been based on action movies, conversely the 1967 Pirates of the Caribbean ride at Disneyland was adapted into ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl]]'' in 2003.

Remakes and film sequels are technically adaptations of the original film.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Maio |first1=Alyssa |title=The Adapted Screenplay: True Adaptations or Academy Categories? |url=https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/what-is-adapted-screenplay/ |website=StudioBinder |access-date=26 May 2023}}</ref> Less direct derivations include ''The Magnificent Seven'' from ''The Seven Samurai'', ''[[Star Wars]]'' from ''[[The Hidden Fortress]]'', and ''[[12 Monkeys]]'' from ''[[La Jetée]]''.

Many films have been made from mythology and religious texts. Both Greek mythology and the Bible have been adapted frequently. Homer's works have been adapted multiple times in several nations.  In these cases, the audience already knows the story well, and so the adaptation will de-emphasize elements of suspense and concentrate instead on detail and phrasing.{{original research inline|date=November 2015}}

==Awards==
Many major film award programs present an award for adapted screenplays, separate from the award for original screenplays.

In the case of a film which was adapted from an unpublished work, however, different awards have different rules around which category the screenplay qualifies for. In 1983, the Canadian [[Genie Awards]] rescinded the Best Adapted Screenplay award they had presented to the film ''[[Melanie (film)|Melanie]]'' when they learned that the original work had been unpublished;<ref name=returned>"Melanie adaptation Genie returned". ''Cinema Canada'', No. 96 (May 1983). p. 12.</ref> and in 2017, the film ''[[Moonlight (2016 film)|Moonlight]]'', which was adapted from an unpublished theatrical play, was classified and nominated as an adapted screenplay by some awards but as an original screenplay by others.<ref name=ineligible>[http://ew.com/article/2016/12/15/oscars-loving-moonlight-original-screenplay/ "Oscars: Moonlight ineligible for Best Original Screenplay"]. ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', December 15, 2016.</ref>

==Adaptation of films==
When a film's screenplay is original, it can also be the source of derivative works such as novels and plays. For example, movie studios will commission novelizations of their popular titles or sell the rights to their titles to publishing houses. These novelized films will frequently be written on assignment and sometimes written by authors who have only an early script as their source. Consequently, novelizations are quite often changed from the films as they appear in theatres.

Novelization can build up characters and incidents for commercial reasons (e.g. to market a card or computer game, to promote the publisher's "saga" of novels, or to create continuity between films in a series)

There have been instances of novelists who have worked from their own screenplays to create novels at nearly the same time as a film. Both [[Arthur C. Clarke]], with ''2001: A Space Odyssey'', and [[Graham Greene]], with ''[[The Third Man]]'', have worked from their own film ideas to a novel form (although the novel version of ''The Third Man'' was written more to aid in the development of the screenplay than for the purposes of being released as a novel). Both [[John Sayles]] and [[Ingmar Bergman]] write their film ideas as novels before they begin producing them as films, although neither director has allowed these prose treatments to be published.

Finally, films have inspired and been adapted into plays. [[John Waters]]'s films have been successfully mounted as plays; both ''[[Hairspray (1988 film)|Hairspray]]'' and ''[[Cry-Baby]]'' have been adapted, and other films have spurred subsequent theatrical adaptations. ''[[Spamalot]]'' is a Broadway play based on [[Monty Python]] films. In a rare case of a film being adapted from a stage musical adaptation of a film, in 2005, the film adaptation of the stage musical based on [[Mel Brooks]]' classic comedy film ''[[The Producers (1967 film)|The Producers]]'' was released.
