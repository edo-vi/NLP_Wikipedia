It is the 8th episode of the 2nd season of the [[YouTube]] video series ''[[Epic Rap Battles of History]]''. The video was released on October 15, 2012 on the show's YouTube channel in anticipation of the [[2012 United States presidential election|2012 US presidential election]].

==Music video==
The video features [[President of the United States]] [[Barack Obama]] (portrayed by [[Iman Crosson]]) and former [[Governor of Massachusetts]] [[Mitt Romney]] (portrayed by [[Lloyd Ahlquist]]) facing off in a rap battle. Following four back-and-forth verses, former President [[Abraham Lincoln]] (portrayed by [[Peter Shukoff]]) interrupts the two and begins rapping against both Obama and Romney (Lincoln had previously appeared in the first season of the series, battling [[Chuck Norris]]) Lincoln proceeds to "bitch smack" the two before being carried away by an [[American bald eagle]].

As of November 2022, the video has received over 158 million views on YouTube.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dX_1B0w7Hzc|title=Barack Obama vs Mitt Romney.

==Legacy==
Two spiritual sequels to the battle, "[[Donald Trump]] vs [[Hillary Clinton]]"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kbryz0mxuMY|title=Donald Trump vs Hillary Clinton. Epic Rap Battles Of History Season 5.|date=October 26, 2016|via=YouTube|publisher=Epic Rap Battles of History|access-date=January 31, 2022}}</ref> and "Donald Trump vs [[Joe Biden]]"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkGK7bitav0|title=Donald Trump vs Joe Biden. Epic Rap Battles Of History Season 6.|date=October 24, 2020|via=YouTube|publisher=Epic Rap Battles of History|access-date=January 31, 2022}}</ref> were made in correspondence with the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016]] and [[2020 United States presidential election|2020]] presidential elections. Abraham Lincoln returns in the former as a third party rapper, only "bitch smacking" Trump, though he does make Clinton flinch.{{Citation needed|date=August 2023}} This was allegedly done as Peter and Lloyd thought it would not be in Lincoln's nature to hit a woman. Following criticism that the battle was tipped in favor of Clinton as support for her in the election (as her criticism by Lincoln was less harsh than that directed at Trump), "Donald Trump vs Joe Biden" did not feature a third-party rapper.{{Citation needed|date=August 2023}}
