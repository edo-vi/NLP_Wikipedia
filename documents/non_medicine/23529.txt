A '''proverb''' (from {{lang-la|proverbium}}) is a simple, traditional [[saying]] that expresses a perceived truth based on common sense or experience. Proverbs are often [[metaphorical]] and use [[formulaic speech|formulaic language]]. A proverbial phrase or a proverbial expression is a type of a conventional saying similar to proverbs and transmitted by oral tradition. The difference is that a proverb is a fixed expression, while a proverbial phrase permits alterations to fit the grammar of the context.<ref>{{cite journal |url= https://www.jstor.org/stable/1497581 |jstor=1497581 |title=Proverbial Phrases from California |last1=Adams |first1=Owen S. |journal=Western Folklore |date=1949 |volume=8 |issue=2 |pages=95–116 |doi=10.2307/1497581}}</ref><ref>[[Arvo Krikmann]] "the Great Chain Metaphor: An Open Sezame for Proverb Semantics?", ''[[Proverbium (journal)|Proverbium:Yearbook of International Scholarship]], 11 (1994), pp. 117–124.''</ref> Collectively, they form a [[folklore genre|genre of folklore]].

Some proverbs exist in more than one language because people borrow them from languages and cultures with which they are in contact. In the West, the Bible (including, but not limited to the [[Book of Proverbs]]) and medieval Latin (aided by the work of [[Erasmus]]) have played a considerable role in distributing proverbs. Not all Biblical proverbs, however, were distributed to the same extent: one scholar has gathered evidence to show that cultures in which the Bible is the major spiritual book contain "between three hundred and five hundred proverbs that stem from the Bible,"<ref>p. 12, Wolfgang Mieder. 1990. ''Not by bread alone: Proverbs of the Bible''. New England Press.</ref> whereas another shows that, of the 106 most common and widespread proverbs across Europe, 11 are from the Bible.<ref>Paczolay, Gyula. 1997. ''European Proverbs in 55 Languages''. Veszpre'm, Hungary.</ref> However, almost every culture has its own unique proverbs.

== Definitions ==
[[Lord John Russell]] (c. 1850) observed poetically that a "proverb is the wit of one, and the wisdom of many."<ref>p. 25. Wolfgang Mieder. 1993. "The wit of one, and the wisdom of many: General thoughts on the nature of the proverb. ''Proverbs are never out of season: Popular wisdom in the modern age'' 3–40. Oxford University Press.</ref> But giving the word "proverb" the sort of definition theorists need has proven to be a difficult task, and although scholars often quote [[Archer Taylor]]'s argument that formulating a scientific "definition of a proverb is too difficult to repay the undertaking... An incommunicable quality tells us this sentence is proverbial and that one is not. Hence no definition will enable us to identify positively a sentence as proverbial,"<ref>p. 3 Archer Taylor. 1931. ''The Proverb''. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press.</ref> many students of proverbs have attempted to itemize their essential characteristics.

More constructively, Mieder has proposed the following definition, "A proverb is a short, generally known sentence of the folk which contains wisdom, truth, morals, and traditional views in a metaphorical, fixed, and memorizable form and which is handed down from generation to generation".<ref>p. 5. Wolfgang Mieder. 1993. "The wit of one, and the wisdom of many: General thoughts on the nature of the proverb. Proverbs are never out of season: Popular wisdom in the modern age 3–40. Oxford University Press.</ref>  To distinguish proverbs from idioms, cliches, etc., Norrick created a table of [[distinctive feature]]s, an abstract tool originally developed for linguistics.<ref>p. 73. Neil Norrick. 1985. ''How Proverbs Mean: Semantic Studies in English Proverbs''. Amsterdam: Mouton.</ref> Prahlad distinguishes proverbs from some other, closely related types of sayings, "True proverbs must further be distinguished from other types of proverbial speech, e.g. proverbial phrases, [[Wellerism]]s, maxims, quotations, and proverbial comparisons."<ref>p. 33. Sw. Anand Prahlad. 1996. ''African-American Proverbs in Context''. Jackson: University Press of Mississippi.</ref> Based on Persian proverbs, Zolfaghari and Ameri propose the following definition: "A proverb is a short sentence, which is well-known and at times rhythmic, including advice, sage themes and ethnic experiences, comprising simile, metaphor or irony which is well-known among people for its fluent wording, clarity of expression, simplicity, expansiveness and generality and is used either with or without change."<ref>p. 107, Hassan Zolfaghari & Hayat Ameri. "Persian Proverbs: Definitions and Characteristics". ''Journal of Islamic and Human Advanced Research'' 2(2012) 93–108.</ref>

There are many sayings in English that are commonly referred to as "proverbs", such as weather sayings. [[Alan Dundes]], however, rejects including such sayings among truly proverbs: "Are weather proverbs proverbs? I would say emphatically 'No!'"<ref>p. 45. Alan Dundes. 1984. On whether weather 'proverbs' are proverbs. ''Proverbium'' 1:39–46. Also, 1989, in ''Folklore Matters'' edited by Alan Dundes, 92–97. Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press.</ref> The definition of "proverb" has also changed over the years. For example, the following was labeled "A Yorkshire proverb" in 1883, but would not be categorized as a proverb by most today, "as throng as Throp's wife when she hanged herself with a dish-cloth".<ref>A Yorkshire proverb. 1883. ''The Academy''. July 14, no. 584. p.30.</ref> The changing of the definition of "proverb" is also noted in [[Turkish language|Turkish]].<ref>Ezgi Ulusoy Aranyosi. 2010. "Atasözü neydi, ne oldu?" ["What was, and what now is, a 'proverb'?"]. ''Millî Folklor: International and Quarterly Journal of Cultural Studies'' 11.88: 5–15.</ref>

In other languages and cultures, the definition of "proverb" also differs from English. In the [[Chumburung language]] of Ghana, "''aŋase'' are literal proverbs and ''akpare'' are metaphoric ones".<ref>p. 64. Gillian Hansford. 2003. Understanding Chumburung proverbs. ''Journal of West African Languages'' 30.1:57–82.</ref> Among the Bini of Nigeria, there are three words that are used to translate "proverb": ''ere, ivbe'', and ''itan''. The first relates to historical events, the second relates to current events, and the third was "linguistic ornamentation in formal discourse".<ref>p. 4,5. Daniel Ben-Amos. Introduction: Folklore in African Society. ''Forms of Folklore in Africa'', edited by Bernth Lindfors, pp. 1–36. Austin: University of Texas.</ref> Among the [[Balochi language|Balochi]] of Pakistan and Afghanistan, there is a word ''batal'' for ordinary proverbs and ''bassīttuks'' for "proverbs with background stories".<ref>p. 43. Sabir Badalkhan. 2000. "Ropes break at the weakest point": Some examples of Balochi proverbs with background stories. ''Proverbium'' 17:43–69.</ref>

There are also language communities that combine proverbs and riddles in some sayings, leading some scholars to create the label "proverb riddles".<ref>John C. Messenger, Jr. Anang Proverb-Riddles. The Journal of American Folklore Vol. 73, No. 289 (July–September 1960), pp. 225–235.</ref><ref>p. 418. Finnegan, Ruth. ''Oral Literature in Africa''. The Saylor Foundation, 1982.</ref><ref>Umoh, S. J. 2007. The Ibibio Proverb{{snd}}Riddles and Language Pedagogy. ''International Journal of Linguistics and Communication'' 11(2), 8–13.</ref>

Another similar construction is an [[idiom]]atic phrase. Sometimes it is difficult to draw a distinction between idiomatic phrase and proverbial expression. In both of them the meaning does not immediately follow from the phrase. The difference is that an idiomatic phrase involves figurative language in its components, while in a proverbial phrase the figurative meaning is the extension of its literal meaning. Some experts  classify proverbs and proverbial phrases as types of idioms.<ref>Lexicography: Critical Concepts (2003) R. R. K. Hartmann, Mick R K Smith, {{ISBN|0-415-25365-9}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=x8LpWk9sPOEC&dq=%22proverbial+phrases+are%22&pg=PA303 p. 303]</ref>

Proverbs come from a variety of sources.<ref>Barbour, Frances M. "Some uncommon sources of proverbs." ''Midwest Folklore'' 13.2 (1963): 97–100.</ref> Some are, indeed, the result of people pondering and crafting language, such as some by [[Confucius]], [[Plato]], [[Baltasar Gracián]], etc. Others are taken from such diverse sources as poetry,<ref>Korosh Hadissi. 2010.

New Haven: Yale University Press.</ref> A number of the well known sayings of Jesus, Shakespeare, and others have become proverbs, though they were original at the time of their creation, and many of these sayings were not seen as proverbs when they were first coined. Many proverbs are also based on stories, often the end of a story. For example, the proverb "[[Belling the cat|Who will bell the cat]]?" is from the end of a story about the mice planning how to be safe from the cat.<ref>p. 68. Kent, Graeme. 1991.

Some authors have created proverbs in their writings, such as [[J.R.R. Tolkien]],<ref name="Michael Stanton 1996"/><ref name="Trokhimenko, Olga 2003"/> and some of these proverbs have made their way into broader society. Similarly, C.S. Lewis' created proverb about a lobster in a pot, from the ''[[Chronicles of Narnia]]'', has also gained currency.<ref>Peter Unseth. 2014. A created proverb in a novel becomes broadly used in society: "‛Easily in but not easily out', as the lobster said in his lobster pot."

== Interpretations ==
Interpreting proverbs is often complex, but is best done in a context.<ref>Jesenšek, Vida. 2014. Pragmatic and stylistic aspects of proverbs. ''Introduction to Paremiology: A Comprehensive Guide to Proverb Studies'', ed. by Hrisztalina Hrisztova-Gotthardt and Melita Aleksa Varga, pp. 133–161. Warsaw & Berlin: DeGruyter Open.</ref> Interpreting proverbs from other cultures is much more difficult than interpreting proverbs in one's own culture. Even within English-speaking cultures, there is difference of opinion on how to interpret the proverb "[[A rolling stone gathers no moss]]." Some see it as condemning a person that keeps moving, seeing moss as a positive thing, such as profit; others see the proverb as praising people that keep moving and developing, seeing moss as a negative thing, such as negative habits.<ref>p. 224,225. Flavell, Linda and roger Flavell. 1993. ''The Dictionary of Proverbs and Their Origins''. London: Kyle Cathie.</ref>

Similarly, among [[Tajik language|Tajik]] speakers, the proverb "One hand cannot clap" has two significantly different interpretations. Most see the proverb as promoting teamwork. Others understand it to mean that an argument requires two people.<ref>p. 158. Evan Bell. 2009. ''An analysis of Tajik proverbs''. Masters thesis, Graduate Institute of Applied Linguistics.</ref> In an extreme example, one researcher working in Ghana found that for a single Akan proverb, twelve different interpretations were given.<ref>Sjaak van der Geest. 1996. The Elder and His Elbow: Twelve Interpretations of an Akan Proverb. ''Research in African Literatures'' Vol. 27, No. 3: 110–118.</ref> Proverb interpretation is not automatic, even for people within a culture: Owomoyela tells of a Yoruba radio program that asked people to interpret an unfamiliar Yoruba proverb, "very few people could do so".<ref>Owomoyela, Oyekan. 1988. ''A Kì í : Yorùbá proscriptive and prescriptive proverbs''. Lanham, MD : University Press of America.</ref> Siran found that people who had moved out of the traditional Vute-speaking area of Cameroon were not able to interpret Vute proverbs correctly, even though they still spoke Vute. Their interpretations tended to be literal.<ref>pp. 236–237. Siran, Jean-Louis. 1993. Rhetoric, tradition, and communication: The dialectics of meaning in proverb use. ''Man'' n.s. 28.2:225–242.</ref>

Children will sometimes interpret proverbs in a literal sense, not yet knowing how to understand the conventionalized metaphor. Interpretation of proverbs is also affected by injuries and diseases of the brain, "A hallmark of schizophrenia is impaired proverb interpretation."<ref name="Michael Kiang 2007">Michael Kiang, et al, Cognitive, neurophysiological, and functional correlates of proverb interpretation abnormalities in schizophrenia. ''Journal of the International Neuropsychological Society'' (2007), 13, 653–663. [Futuristic paremiography and paremiology: a plea for the collection and study of modern proverbs. Online access]</ref>

==Features==
===Grammatical structures===
Proverbs in various languages are found with a wide variety of grammatical structures.<ref>See Mac Coinnigh, Marcas. Syntactic Structures in Irish-Language Proverbs. ''Proverbium: Yearbook of International Proverb Scholarship'' 29, 95–136.</ref> In English, for example, we find the following structures (in addition to others):
* Imperative, negative – [[Flogging a dead horse|Don't beat a dead horse.]]
* Imperative, positive – [[wikt:if the shoe fits, wear it|If the shoe fits, wear it]]!
* Parallel phrases – Garbage in, garbage out.
* Rhetorical question – Is the Pope Catholic?
* Declarative sentence – Birds of a feather flock together.

However, people will often quote only a fraction of a proverb to invoke an entire proverb, e.g. "All is fair" instead of "All is fair in love and war", and "A rolling stone" for "A rolling stone gathers no moss."

The grammar of proverbs is not always the typical grammar of the spoken language. Elements are often moved around, to achieve rhyme or focus.<ref>Sebastian J. Floor. 2005. Poetic Fronting in a Wisdom Poetry Text: The Information Structure of Proverbs 7. ''Journal of Northwest Semitic Languages'' 31: 23–58.</ref>

Another type of grammatical construction is the [[wellerism]], a speaker and a quotation, often with an unusual circumstance, such as the following, a representative of a wellerism proverb found in many languages: "The bride couldn't dance; she said, 'The room floor isn't flat.'"<ref>p. 20, 21. Unseth, Peter, Daniel Kliemt, Laurel Morgan, Stephen Nelson, Elaine Marie Scherrer. 2017. Wellerism proverbs: Mapping their distribution. ''GIALens'' 11.3: [https://www.diu.edu/documents/gialens/Vol11-3/Unseth-WPs.pdf website]</ref>

Another type of grammatical structure in proverbs is a short dialogue:
* Shor/Khkas (SW Siberia): "They asked the camel, 'Why is your neck crooked?' The camel laughed roaringly, 'What of me is straight?'"<ref>p. 176. Roos, Marti, Hans Nugteren, Zinaida Waibel. 2006. Khakas and Shor proverbs and proverbial sayings. In ''Exploring the Eastern Frontiers of Turkic'', ed by Marcel Erdal and Irina Nevskaya, pp. 157–192. Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz.</ref>
* [[Armenian language|Armenian]]: "They asked the wine, 'Have you built or destroyed more?' It said, 'I do not know of building; of destroying I know a lot.'"<ref>p. 135. Sakayan, Dora. 1999. Reported and direct speech in proverbs: On Armenian dialogue proverbs. Proverbium 16: 303–324.</ref>
* Bakgatla (a.k.a. [[Tswana language|Tswana]]): "The thukhui jackal said, 'I can run fast.' But the sands said, 'We are wide.'" ([[Botswana]])<ref>p. 246. Mitchison, Naomi and Amos Kgamanyane Pilane. 1967. The Bakgatla of South-East Botswana As Seen through Their Proverbs. ''Folklore'' Vol. 78, No. 4: 241–268.</ref>
* [[Bambara language|Bamana]]: "'Speech, what made you good?' 'The way I am,' said Speech. 'What made you bad?' 'The way I am,' said Speech." (Mali)<ref>p. 221. Kone, Kasim. 1997.'' Bamana verbal art: An ethnographic study of proverbs''. PhD dissertation, Indiana University.</ref>

[[File:Ochsenfurt Hauptstraße 60 Schuster.jpg|thumb|"The cobbler should stick to his last" in German. It is also an old proverb in English, but now "[[last]]" is no longer known to many.]]

===Conservative language===
[[File:Latijnse tekst boven portaal.JPG|left|thumb|Latin proverb over doorway in Netherlands: "No one attacks me with impunity"]]
Because many proverbs are both poetic and traditional, they are often passed down in fixed forms. Though spoken language may change, many proverbs are often preserved in conservative, even [[Archaism|archaic]], form. "Proverbs often contain archaic... words and structures."<ref>p. 21. Norrick, Neal R. "Subject area, terminology, proverb definitions, proverb features." ''Introduction to paremiology: A comprehensive guide to proverb studies'', edited by Hrisztalina Hristova-Gotthardt and Melita Aleksa Varga, (2014): 7-27.</ref>In English, for example, "betwixt" is not commonly used, but a form of it is still heard (or read) in the proverb "There is many a slip 'twixt the cup and the lip." The conservative form preserves the meter and the rhyme. This conservative nature of proverbs can result in archaic words and grammatical structures being preserved in individual proverbs, as has been widely documented, e.g. in Amharic,<ref>p. 691. Michael Ahland. 2009. From topic to subject: Grammatical change in the Amharic possessive construction. ''Studies in Language'' 33.3 pp. 685–717.</ref> Greek,<ref>p. 72. Nikolaos Lazaridis. 2007.

Analysis of Archaic Words in the Structure of English and Uzbek Proverbs. ''EPRA International Journal of Research and Development'' 6.4.2021: 360–362.</ref>

In addition, proverbs may still be used in languages which were once more widely known in a society, but are now no longer so widely known. For example, English speakers use some non-English proverbs that are drawn from languages that used to be widely understood by the educated class, e.g. "C'est la vie" from French and "[[Carpe diem]]" from Latin.

Proverbs are often handed down through generations. Therefore, "many proverbs refer to old measurements, obscure professions, outdated weapons, unknown plants, animals, names, and various other traditional matters."<ref>p. 33. Wolfgang Mieder. 2014. ''Behold the Proverbs of a People: Proverbial Wisdom in Culture, Literature, and Politics.'' Jackson, MS: University Press of Mississippi.</ref>
Therefore, it is common that they preserve words that become less common and archaic in broader society.<ref>Issa O. Sanusi and R.K. Omoloso. The role of Yoruba proverbs in preserving archaic lexical items and expressions in Yoruba.

===Borrowing and spread===
Proverbs are often and easily translated and transferred from one language into another. "There is nothing so uncertain as the derivation of proverbs, the same proverb being often found in all nations, and it is impossible to assign its paternity."<ref>p. ii. Thomas Fielding. 1825. Select proverbs of all nations. New York: Covert.</ref>
[[File:Притча о слепых.jpeg|290px|thumb|''[[The Blind Leading the Blind]]'' by [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]]]]
Proverbs are often borrowed across lines of language, religion, and even time. For example, a proverb of the approximate form "No flies enter a mouth that is shut" is currently found in Spain, France, Ethiopia, and many countries in between. It is embraced as a true local proverb in many places and should not be excluded in any collection of proverbs because it is shared by the neighbors. However, though it has gone through multiple languages and millennia, the proverb can be traced back to an ancient Babylonian proverb<ref>p. 146. Pritchard, James. 1958. ''The Ancient Near East'', vol. 2. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press.</ref> Another example of a widely spread proverb is "A drowning person clutches at [frogs] foam", found in Peshai of Afghanistan<ref>p. 67. Ju-Hong Yun and Pashai Language Committee. 2010. On a mountain there is still a road. Peshawar, Pakistan: InterLit Foundation.</ref> and Orma of Kenya,<ref>p. 24. Calvin C. Katabarwa and Angelique Chelo. 2012. Wisdom from Orma, Kenya proverbs and wise sayings. Nairobi: African Proverbs Working Group. http://www.afriprov.org/images/afriprov/books/wisdomofOrmaproverbs.pdf</ref> and presumably places in between.

Proverbs about one hand clapping are common across Asia,<ref>Kamil V. Zvelebil. 1987. The Sound of the One Hand. Journal of the American Oriental Society, Vol. 107, No. 1, pp. 125–126.</ref> from Dari in Afghanistan<ref>p. 16, Edward Zellem. 2012.

New York, Columbia University Press.</ref> Some studies have been done devoted to the spread of proverbs in certain regions, such as India and her neighbors<ref>Ludwik Sternbach. 1981. Indian Wisdom and Its Spread beyond India. Journal of the American Oriental Society Vol. 101, No. 1, pp. 97–131.</ref> and Europe.<ref>Matti Kuusi; Marje Joalaid; Elsa Kokare; Arvo Krikmann; Kari Laukkanen; Pentti Leino; Vaina Mālk; Ingrid Sarv. Proverbia Septentrionalia. ''900 Balto-Finnic Proverb Types with Russian, Baltic, German and Scandinavian Parallels''. Suomalainen Tiedeakatemia (1985)</ref> An extreme example of the borrowing and spread of proverbs was the work done to create a corpus of proverbs for [[Esperanto]], where all the proverbs were translated from other languages.<ref>Fiedler, Sabine. 1999. Phraseology in planned languages. ''Language problems and language planning'' 23.2: 175–187.</ref>

It is often not possible to trace the direction of borrowing a proverb between languages. This is complicated by the fact that the borrowing may have been through plural languages. In some cases, it is possible to make a strong case for discerning the direction of the borrowing based on an artistic form of the proverb in one language, but a prosaic form in another language. For example, in Ethiopia there is a proverb "Of mothers and water, there is none evil." It is found in [[Amharic]], [[Alaba-K'abeena language|Alaaba language]], and [[Oromo language|Oromo]], three languages of Ethiopia:
* Oromo: ''Hadhaa fi bishaan, hamaa hin qaban.''
* Amharic: ''Käənnatənna wəha, kəfu yälläm.''
* Alaaba: ''Wiihaa ʔamaataa hiilu yoosebaʔa''<ref>p. 92. Gertrud Schneider-Blum. 2009. ''Máakuti t'awá shuultáa: Proverbs finish the problems: Sayings of the Alaaba (Ethiopia)''. Köln: Rüdiger Köppe Verlag.</ref>
The Oromo version uses poetic features, such as the initial ''ha'' in both clauses with the final ''-aa'' in the same word, and both clauses ending with ''-an''. Also, both clauses are built with the vowel ''a'' in the first and last words, but the vowel ''i'' in the one syllable central word. In contrast, the Amharic and Alaaba versions of the proverb show little evidence of sound-based art.

However, not all languages have proverbs. Proverbs are (nearly) universal across Europe, Asia, and Africa. Some languages in the Pacific have them, such as Maori.<ref>Brougham, Aileen E., Alexander Wyclif Reed, and Tīmoti Sam Kāretu. ''The Reed book of Maori proverbs.'' Reed Books, 1999.</ref> Other Pacific languages do not, e.g. "there are no proverbs in [[Kilivila]]" of the [[Trobriand Islands]].<ref>p. 277. Senft, Gunter. 2010. ''The Trobriand Islanders' Ways of Speaking.'' (Volume 27 of Trends in Linguistics. Documentation.) Berlin: Walter de Gruyter.</ref>  However, in the New World, there are almost no proverbs: "While proverbs abound in the thousands in most cultures of the world, it remains a riddle why the Native Americans have hardly any proverb tradition at all."<ref>p. 108. Mieder, Wolfgang. 2004. ''Proverbs: A handbook. Greenwood Publishing Group.''</ref> Hakamies has examined the matter of whether proverbs are found universally, a universal genre, concluding that they are not.<ref>Hakamies, Pekka. 2016. "Proverbs – A Universal Genre?", in ''Multidisciplinary Perspectives on Folklore and Beyond'', ed. by Kaarina Koski and Frog with Ulla Savolainen, pp. 299–316. Helsinki: Finnish Literature Society.</ref>

==Use==
===In conversation===
Proverbs are used in conversation by adults more than children, partially because adults have learned more proverbs than children. Also, using proverbs well is a skill that is developed over years. Additionally, children have not mastered the patterns of metaphorical expression that are invoked in proverb use. Proverbs, because they are indirect, allow a speaker to disagree or give advice in a way that may be less offensive. Studying actual proverb use in conversation, however, is difficult since the researcher must wait for proverbs to happen.<ref>Elias Dominguez Baraja. 2010. ''The function of proverbs in discourse''. Berlin: de Gruyter Mouton.</ref> An Ethiopian researcher, Tadesse Jaleta Jirata, made headway in such research by attending and taking notes at events where he knew proverbs were expected to be part of the conversations.<ref name="Tadesse Jaleta Jirata 2009">Tadesse Jaleta Jirata. 2009.

===In literature===
[[File:Not all who wander are lost.png|thumb|[http://www.elvenminstrel.com/tolkien/proverbs.htm Created proverb] from [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''Lord of the Rings'' on a bumper sticker.]]

Many authors have used proverbs in their writings, for a very wide variety of literary genres: epics,<ref>Hallo, William W. "Proverbs Quoted in Epic."

Probably the most famous user of proverbs in novels is [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] in his ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' series.<ref name="Michael Stanton 1996">Michael Stanton. 1996. Advice is a dangerous gift. ''Proverbium'' 13: 331–345</ref><ref name="Trokhimenko, Olga 2003">Trokhimenko, Olga. 2003.

''Leviathan'' 16: 135–152.</ref> Also, [[C. S. Lewis]] created a dozen proverbs in ''[[The Horse and His Boy]]'',<ref name="Unseth, Peter 2011">Unseth, Peter. 2011. A culture "full of choice apophthegms and useful maxims": invented proverbs in C.S. Lewis' ''The Horse and His Boy'' ''Proverbium'' 28: 323–338.</ref> and [[Mercedes Lackey]] created dozens for her invented [[Shin'a'in]] and Tale'edras cultures;<ref>Proverbs from Velgarth – http://www.dragonlordsnet.com/danp.htm</ref> Lackey's proverbs are notable in that they are reminiscent to those of Ancient Asia – e.g. "Just because you feel certain an enemy is lurking behind every bush, it doesn't follow that you are wrong" is like to "Before telling secrets on the road, look in the bushes." These authors are notable for not only using proverbs as integral to the development of the characters and the story line, but also for creating proverbs.<ref name="Unseth, Peter 2011"/>

Among medieval literary texts, [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s [[Troilus and Criseyde]] plays a special role because Chaucer's usage seems to challenge the truth value of proverbs by exposing their epistemological unreliability.<ref>Richard Utz, "''Sic et Non'': Zu Funktion und Epistemologie des Sprichwortes bei Geoffrey Chaucer," ''Das Mittelalter: Perspektiven mediävistischer Forschung'' 2.2 (1997), 31–43.</ref> [[Rabelais]] used proverbs to write an entire chapter of [[Gargantua]].<ref>p. 903. Taylor, Archer. 1950. Proverbs. ''Funk and Wagnalls Standard Dictionary of Folklore, Mythology and Legend'', Maria Leach ed. 902–905. New York: Funk & Wagnalls.</ref>

The patterns of using proverbs in literature can change over time. A study of "classical Chinese novels" found proverb use as frequently as one proverb every 3,500 words in the ''[[Water Margin]]'' (''Shuihu zhuan'') and one proverb every 4,000 words in ''Wen Jou-hsiang''. But modern Chinese novels have fewer proverbs by far.<ref>Eberhard, W. 1967. Some notes on the use of proverbs in Chinese novels. ''Proverbium'' no. 9: 201–208.</ref>

[[File:Hercules & Waggoner2.jpg|left|thumb|"Hercules and the Wagoner", illustration for children's book]]
Proverbs (or portions of them) have been the inspiration for titles of books: ''The Bigger they Come'' by [[Erle Stanley Gardner]], and ''Birds of a Feather'' (several books with this title), ''Devil in the Details'' (multiple books with this title). Sometimes a title alludes to a proverb, but does not actually quote much of it, such as ''The Gift Horse's Mouth'' by Robert Campbell. Some books or stories have titles that are twisted proverbs, anti-proverbs, such as ''No use dying over spilled milk'',<ref>Myers, Tamar. 1996. ''No use dying over spelled milk''. New York: Penguin Books.</ref> ''When life gives you lululemons,''<ref>Weisburger, Lauren. 2018. ''When life gives you lululemons.'' Simon & Schuster.</ref> and two books titled ''Blessed are the Cheesemakers''.<ref>Lynch, Sarah-Kate. 2004. ''Blessed are the Cheesemakers''. Grand Central Publications and Tricia Goyr & Cara Putman. 2016. ''Blessed are the Cheesemakers.''</ref> The twisted proverb of last title was also used in the [[Monty Python]] movie [[Life of Brian]], where a person mishears one of Jesus Christ's [[beatitudes]], "I think it was 'Blessed are the cheesemakers.'"

Some books and stories are built around a proverb. Some of Tolkien's books have been analyzed as having "governing proverbs" where "the acton of a book turns on or fulfills a proverbial saying."<ref>p. 332. Stanton, Michael. 1996. "Advice is a dangerous gift": (Pseudo)proverbs in ''The Lord of the Rings''. ''Proverbium'' 13:331–346.</ref> Some stories have been written with a proverb overtly as an opening, such as "A stitch in time saves nine" at the beginning of "Kitty's Class Day", one of [[Louisa May Alcott]]'s ''Proverb Stories''. Other times, a proverb appears at the end of a story, summing up a moral to the story, frequently found in [[Aesop's Fables]], such as "[[God helps those who help themselves|Heaven helps those who help themselves]]" from ''Hercules and the Wagoner''.<ref>p. 19. Kent, Graeme. 1991. ''Aesop's Fables.'' Newmarket, UK: Brimax.</ref> In a novel by the Ivorian novelist [[Ahmadou Kourouma]], "proverbs are used to conclude each chapter".<ref>p. 86. Repinecz, Jonathon. 2013. ''Whose Hero? Reinventing Epic in French West African Literature''. University of California, Berkeley: PhD dissertation.</ref>

Proverbs have also been used strategically by poets.<ref>Sobieski, Janet and Wolfgang Mieder. 2005. ''"So many heads, so many wits": An anthology of English proverb poetry.'' (Supplement Series of ''Proverbium'', 18.) Burlington, VT: University of Vermont.</ref> Sometimes proverbs (or portions of them or [[anti-proverb]]s) are used for titles, such as "A bird in the bush" by [[Hilton Young, 1st Baron Kennet|Lord Kennet]] and his stepson [[Peter Scott]] and "[[The blind leading the blind]]" by Lisa Mueller. Sometimes, multiple proverbs are important parts of poems, such as [[Paul Muldoon]]'s "Symposium", which begins "You can lead a horse to water but you can't make it hold its nose to the grindstone and hunt with the hounds. Every dog has a stitch in time..." In Finnish there are proverb poems written hundreds of years ago.<ref>Lauhakangas, Outi. "The Oldest Finnish Proverb Poems in Relation to the [[Matti Kuusi]] International Database od Proverbs." ''Acta Ethnographica Hungarica'' 45.3–4 (2000): 401–420.</ref> The Turkish poet Refiki wrote an entire poem by stringing proverbs together, which has been translated into English poetically yielding such verses as "Be watchful and be wary, / But seldom grant a boon; / The man who calls the piper / Will also call the tune."<ref>A. L. Macfie and F. A. Macfie. 2001. A Proverb Poem by Refiki. ''Asian Folklore Studies'' Vol. 60, Issue 1, pp. 5–19.</ref> [[Eliza Griswold]] also created a poem by stringing proverbs together, Libyan proverbs translated into English.<ref>Griswold, Eliza. 2012, Libyan Proverbs. ''Poetry'' 201.3:372–377.</ref>

Because proverbs are familiar and often pointed, they have been used by a number of hip-hop poets. This has been true not only in the USA, birthplace of hip-hop, but also in Nigeria. Since Nigeria is so multilingual, hip-hop poets there use proverbs from various languages, mixing them in as it fits their need, sometimes translating the original. For example,
<br />"They forget say ogbon ju agbaralo
<br />They forget that wisdom is greater than power"<ref>p. 43. Akande, Akinmade Timothy and Adebayo
Mosobalaje. 2014. The use of proverbs in hip-hop music: The example of Yoruba proverbs in 9ices's music. ''Proverbium'' 31:35–58.</ref>

Some authors have bent and twisted proverbs, creating anti-proverbs, for a variety of literary effects. For example, in the [[Harry Potter]] novels, [[J. K. Rowling]] reshapes a standard English proverb into "It's no good crying over spilt potion" and [[Dumbledore]] advises Harry not to "count your owls before they are delivered".<ref>Heather A. Haas. 2011. The Wisdom of Wizards{{snd}}and Muggles and Squibs: Proverb Use in the World of Harry Potter. ''Journal of American Folklore'' 124(492): 38.</ref> In a slightly different use of reshaping proverbs, in the [[Aubrey–Maturin series]] of historical naval novels by [[Patrick O'Brian]], Capt. [[Jack Aubrey]] humorously mangles and mis-splices proverbs, such as "Never count the bear's skin before it is hatched" and "There's a good deal to be said for making hay while the iron is hot."<ref>Jan Harold Brunvand. 2004. "The Early Bird Is Worth Two in the Bush": Captain Jack Aubrey's Fractured Proverbs. ''What Goes Around Comes Around: The Circulation of Proverbs in Contemporary Life'', Kimberly J. Lau, Peter Tokofsky, Stephen D. Winick, (eds.), pp. 152–170. Logan, Utah: Utah State University Press. [http://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1032&context=usupress_pubs&sei-redir=1#search=%22What%20Goes%20Around%20Comes%20Around%3A%20Circulation%20Proverbs%20Contemporary%20Life%2C%22 digitalcommons.usu.edu]</ref> Earlier than O'Brian's Aubrey, [[Beatrice Grimshaw]] also used repeated splicings of proverbs in the mouth of an eccentric marquis to create a memorable character in ''The Sorcerer's Stone'',<ref>Unseth, Peter. 2020. Beatrice Grimshaw’s Proverb Splicer and Her Artful Use of Proverbs. ''Proverbium'' 37:341–358.</ref> such as "The proof of the pudding sweeps clean" (p.&nbsp;109) and "A stitch in time is as good as a mile" (p.&nbsp;97).<ref>Grimshaw, Beatrice. 1914. ''The Sorcerer’s Stone.'' Philadelphia: John Winston.</ref>

Because proverbs are so much a part of the language and culture, authors have sometimes used proverbs in historical fiction effectively, but anachronistically, before the proverb was actually known. For example, the novel ''Ramage and the Rebels'', by [[Dudley Pope]] is set in approximately 1800. Captain Ramage reminds his adversary "You are supposed to know that it is dangerous to change horses in midstream" (p.&nbsp;259), with another allusion to the same proverb three pages later. However, the proverb about changing horses in midstream is reliably dated to 1864, so the proverb could not have been known or used by a character from that period.<ref>p. 49, [[Jennifer Speake]]. 2008. ''The Oxford Dictionary of Proverbs'', 5th ed. Oxford University Press.</ref>

Some authors have used so many proverbs that there have been entire books written cataloging their proverb usage, such as [[Charles Dickens]],<ref>George Bryan and Wolfgang Mieder. 1997. ''The Proverbial Charles Dickens''. New York: Peter Lang</ref> [[Agatha Christie]],<ref>George B. Bryan. 1993. ''Black Sheep, Red Herrings, and Blue Murder: The Proverbial Agatha Christie''.

"Zu meiner Hölle will ich den Weg mit guten Sprüchen pflastern". ''Friedrich Nietzsches sprichwörtliche Sprache''. Broschu.</ref>

On the non-fiction side, proverbs have also been used by authors for articles that have no connection to the study of proverbs. Some have been used as the basis for book titles, e.g. ''I Shop, Therefore I Am: Compulsive Buying and the Search for Self'' by April Lane Benson. Some proverbs been used as the basis for article titles, though often in altered form: "All our eggs in a broken basket: How the Human Terrain System is undermining sustainable military cultural competence"<ref>Connable, Ben.

"To Change or Not to Change Horses: The World War II Elections." ''Presidential Studies Quarterly'' Volume 42, Issue 2: 324–342.</ref> Many authors have cited proverbs as epigrams at the beginning of their articles, e.g. "'If you want to dismantle a hedge, remove one thorn at a time' Somali proverb" in an article on peacemaking in Somalia.<ref>Ismail I.

===In drama and film===

In the case of ''[[Forrest Gump]]'', the screenplay by [[Eric Roth]] had more proverbs than the novel by [[Winston Groom]], but for ''[[The Harder They Come]]'', the reverse is true, where the novel derived from the movie by [[Michael Thelwell]] has many more proverbs than the movie.<ref>Coteus, Stephen. 2011. "Trouble never sets like rain": Proverb (in)direction in Michael Thelwell's ''The Harder They Come''. ''Proverbium'' 28:1–30.</ref>

[[Éric Rohmer]], the French film director, directed a series of films, the "Comedies and Proverbs", where each film was based on a proverb: ''[[The Aviator's Wife]]'', ''[[Le Beau mariage|The Perfect Marriage]]'', ''[[Pauline at the Beach]]'', ''[[Full Moon in Paris]]'' (the film's proverb was invented by Rohmer himself: "The one who has two wives loses his soul, the one who has two houses loses his mind."), ''[[The Green Ray]]'', ''[[Boyfriends and Girlfriends]]''.<ref>Pym, John. 1986/1987. Silly Girls. ''Sight and Sound'' 56.1:45–48.</ref>

Movie titles based on proverbs include ''[[Murder Will Out (1939 film)]]'', ''Try, Try Again'', and ''[[The Harder They Fall (1956 film)|The Harder They Fall]]''. A twisted anti-proverb was the title for a [[Three Stooges]] film, ''[[A Bird in the Head]]''. The title of an award-winning Turkish film, [[Three Monkeys (film)|Three Monkeys]], also invokes a proverb, though the title does not fully quote it.

They have also been used as the titles of plays:<ref>Bryan, George. 2002. Proverbial titles of dramas. ''Proverbium'' 19:65–74.</ref> ''[[Don't throw the baby out with the bathwater|Baby with the Bathwater]]'' by [[Christopher Durang]], ''Dog Eat Dog'' by [[Mary Gallagher]], and ''[[The Dog in the Manger]]'' by [[Charles Hale Hoyt]]. The use of proverbs as titles for plays is not, of course, limited to English plays: ''Il faut qu'une porte soit ouverte ou fermée'' (A door must be open or closed) by [[Paul de Musset]]. Proverbs have also been used in musical dramas, such as ''The Full Monty'', which has been shown to use proverbs in clever ways.<ref>Konstantinova, Anna. 2012. Proverbs in an American musical: A cognitive-discursive study of "The Full Monty". ''Proverbium'' 29:67–93.</ref> In the lyrics for ''[[Beauty and the Beast]]'', Gaston plays with three proverbs in sequence, "All roads lead to.../The best things in life are.../All's well that ends with...me."

===In music===

Proverbs are often poetic in and of themselves, making them ideally suited for adapting into songs. Proverbs have been used in music from opera to country to hip-hop. Proverbs have also been used in music in many languages, such as the [[Akan language]]<ref>p. 95 ff. Kwesi Yankah. 1989. ''The Proverb in the Context of Akan Rhetoric.'' Bern: Peter Lang.</ref> the [[Igede language]],<ref>Ode S. Ogede. 1993. Proverb usage in the praise songs of Igede: ''Adiyah'' poet Micah Ichegbeh.

In English the proverb (or rather the beginning of the proverb), [[If the shoe fits (disambiguation)|If the shoe fits]] has been used as a title for three albums and five songs. Other English examples of using proverbs in music<ref>Bryan, Geoerge. 2001. An unfinished List of Anglo-American Proverb Songs. ''Proverbium'' 18:15–56.</ref> include [[Elvis Presley]]'s ''Easy come, easy go'', Harold Robe's ''Never swap horses when you're crossing a stream'', Arthur Gillespie's ''Absence makes the heart grow fonder'', [[Bob Dylan]]'s ''Like a rolling stone'', [[Cher]]'s ''Apples don't fall far from the tree''. [[Lynn Anderson]] made famous a song full of proverbs, ''[[Rose Garden (Lynn Anderson song)|I never promised you a rose garden]]'' (written by [[Joe South]]). In choral music, we find [[Michael Torke]]'s ''Proverbs'' for female voice and ensemble. A number of [[Blues]] musicians have also used proverbs extensively.<ref>Taft, Michael. 1994. Proverbs in the Blues. ''Proverbium'' 12: 227–258.</ref><ref>Prahlad, Sw. Anand. 1996. ''African-American Proverbs in Context''. Jackson: University Press of Mississippi.

In addition to proverbs being used in songs themselves, some rock bands have used parts of proverbs as their names, such as the [[Rolling Stones]], [[Bad Company]], [[The Mothers of Invention]], Feast or Famine, and [[Of Mice and Men (band)|Of Mice and Men]]. There have been at least two groups that called themselves "The Proverbs", and there is a hip-hop performer in South Africa known as "Proverb". In addition, many albums have been named with allusions to proverbs, such as ''Spilt milk'' (a title used by [[Jellyfish (band)|Jellyfish]] and also [[Kristina Train]]), ''The more things change'' by [[Machine Head (band)|Machine Head]], ''Silk purse'' by [[Linda Ronstadt]], ''Another day, another dollar'' by DJ Scream Roccett, ''[[The blind leading the naked]]'' by [[Violent Femmes]], ''What's good for the goose is good for the gander'' by [[Bobby Rush (musician)|Bobby Rush]], ''Resistance is Futile'' by [[Steve Coleman]], ''Murder will out'' by [[Fan the Fury]]. The proverb ''Feast or famine'' has been used as an album title by [[Feast or Famine (Chuck Ragan album)|Chuck Ragan]], [[Feast or Famine (Reef the Lost Cauze album)|Reef the Lost Cauze]], Indiginus, and DaVinci. [[Whitehorse (band)|Whitehorse]] mixed two proverbs for the name of their album ''Leave no bridge unburned''. The band Splinter Group released an album titled ''[[When in Rome, do as the Romans do|When in Rome]], Eat Lions''. The band Downcount used a proverb for the name of their tour, ''[[Come and take it]]''.<ref>p. 10. Singh, Anup K. 2017. ''Dictionary of Proverbs''. Neelkanth Prakashan Publishers.</ref>

From ancient times, people around the world have recorded proverbs in visual form. This has been done in two ways. First, proverbs have been ''written'' to be displayed, often in a decorative manner, such as on pottery, cross-stitch, murals,<ref>Victor Khachan. 2012. Courtroom proverbial murals in Lebanon: a semiotic reconstruction of justice. ''Social Semiotics'' {{doi|10.1080/10350330.2012.665262}}</ref><ref>Martin Charlot. 2007.

"'When Life Hands You Scraps, Make a Quilt': Quiltmakers and the Tradition of Proverbial Inscriptions."

Proverbs in Polish graffiti, Estonia and Poland. ''Creativity and Tradition in Cultural Communication'' 1, 269–284.</ref>

Secondly, proverbs have often been visually depicted in a variety of media, including paintings, etchings, and sculpture. [[Jakob Jordaens]] painted a plaque with a proverb about drunkenness above a drunk man wearing a crown, titled ''The King Drinks''. Probably the most famous examples of depicting proverbs are the different versions of the paintings ''[[Netherlandish Proverbs]]'' by the father and son [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]] and [[Pieter Brueghel the Younger]], the proverbial meanings of these paintings being the subject of a 2004 conference, which led to a published volume of studies (Mieder 2004a). The same father and son also painted versions of [[The Blind Leading the Blind]], a Biblical proverb. These and similar paintings inspired another famous painting depicting some proverbs and also idioms (leading to a series of additional paintings), such as ''[[Proverbidioms]]'' by [[T. E. Breitenbach]]. Another painting inspired by Bruegel's work is by the Chinese artist, Ah To, who created a painting illustrating 81 Cantonese sayings.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://writecantonese8.wordpress.com/2014/02/25/cantonese-proverbs-in-one-picture/ |title=Cantonese Proverbs in One Picture |date=25 February 2014}}</ref>  Corey Barksdale has produced a book of paintings with specific proverbs and pithy quotations.<ref>Corey Barksdale. 2011. ''Art & Inspirational Proverbs''. Lulu.com.{{self-published source|date=February 2020}}</ref>{{self-published inline|date=February 2020}} The British artist [[Chris Gollon]] has painted a major work entitled ''Big Fish Eat Little Fish'', a title echoing Bruegel's painting of the same name.<ref>{{Cite web |url= http://www.chrisgollon.com/collections/big-fish-eat-little-fish/ |title=Gollon's painting |access-date=2018-12-02 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20171220155210/http://www.chrisgollon.com/collections/big-fish-eat-little-fish/ |archive-date=2017-12-20 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

[[File:Oliver Pelton - Benjamin Franklin - Poor Richard's Almanac Illustrated.jpg|thumb|Illustrations showing proverbs from Ben Franklin]]
[[File:Three wise monkeys figure.JPG|thumb|[[Three wise monkeys]], invoking a proverb, with no text.]]
Sometimes well-known proverbs are pictured on objects, without a text actually quoting the proverb, such as the [[three wise monkeys]] who remind us "Hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil". When the proverb is well known, viewers are able to recognize the proverb and understand the image appropriately, but if viewers do not recognize the proverb, much of the effect of the image is lost. For example, there is a Japanese painting in the [[Ōmiya Bonsai Village|Bonsai museum]] in [[Saitama, Saitama|Saitama city]] that depicted flowers on a dead tree, but only when the curator learned the ancient (and no longer current) proverb "Flowers on a dead tree" did the curator understand the deeper meaning of the painting.<ref>p. 426. Yoko Mori. 2012. Review of  ''Dictionary of Japanese Illustrated Proverbs''. ''Proverbium'' 29:435–456.</ref> Also in Japan, an image of [[Mount Fuji]], a hawk/falcon, and three egg plants, leads viewers to remember the proverb, "One Mt. Fuji, two falcons, three egg plants", a [[Hatsuyume]] dream predicting a long life.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://jpninfo.com/38217 |title=GaijinPot}}</ref>

A study of school students found that students remembered proverbs better when there were visual representations of proverbs along with the verbal form of the proverbs.<ref>Kamau, Wango. ''Use of Visual Illustration in the Interpretation of Proverbs in Secondary Schools in Kikuyu District, Kiambu County, Kenya''. Kenyatta University PhD dissertation.</ref>

A bibliography on proverbs in visual form has been prepared by Mieder and Sobieski (1999). Interpreting visual images of proverbs is subjective, but familiarity with the depicted proverb helps.<ref>pp. 203–213. Richard Honeck. 1997. ''A Proverb in Mind''. Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum.</ref>

Some artists have used proverbs and anti-proverbs for titles of their paintings, alluding to a proverb rather than picturing it. For example, [[Vivienne LeWitt]] painted a piece titled  "If the shoe doesn't fit, must we change the foot?", which shows neither foot nor shoe, but a woman counting her money as she contemplates different options when buying vegetables.<ref>{{cite web|author=database and e-research tool for art and design researchers |url= http://www.daao.org.au/bio/work/if-the-shoe-doesnt-fit-must-we-change-the-foot/ |title=If the shoe doesn't fit, must we change the foot? |work=Design and Art Australia Online |publisher=Daao.org.au |date=2012-10-20 |access-date=2013-08-30}}</ref>

In 2018, 13 sculptures depicting Maltese proverbs were installed in open spaces of downtown [[Valletta]].<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20180203/community/valletta-statue-depicting-proverb-gets-tongues-wagging-online.669628 |title=Article on Maltese proverb sculptures|date=3 February 2018 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2018-02-02/local-news/A-bum-a-bird-and-a-pig-Valletta-2018-unveils-Kif-Jghid-Il-Malti-public-art-installations-6736184371|title=A bum, a bird and a pig: Valletta 2018 unveils 'Kif Jgħid Il-Malti' public art installations – The Malta Independent|website=Independent.com.mt|access-date=3 June 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.timesofmalta.com/mobile/articles/view/20180202/arts-entertainment/valletta-2018-unveils-public-art-installations.669557 |title=Arts & Entertainment |work=Times of Malta |access-date=3 June 2018}}</ref>

===In cartoons===
Cartoonists, both editorial and pure humorists, have often used proverbs, sometimes primarily building on the text, sometimes primarily on the situation visually, the best cartoons combining both. Not surprisingly, cartoonists often twist proverbs, such as visually depicting a proverb literally or twisting the text as an anti-proverb.<ref>Trokhimenko, Olga V. 1999."Wie ein Elefant im Porzellanlanden": Ursprung, Überlieferung und Gebrauch der Redensart in Deutschen und im Englischen. ''Proverbium'' 16: 351–380</ref> An example with all of these traits is a cartoon showing a waitress delivering two plates with worms on them, telling the customers, "Two early bird specials... here ya go."<ref>The Argyle Sweater, May 1, 2011.</ref>

The traditional [[Three wise monkeys]] were depicted in [[Bizarro]] with different labels. Instead of the negative imperatives, the one with ears covered bore the sign "See and speak evil", the one with eyes covered bore the sign "See and hear evil", etc. The caption at the bottom read "The power of positive thinking."<ref>June 26, 2011.</ref>  Another cartoon showed a customer in a pharmacy telling a pharmacist, "I'll have an ounce of prevention."<ref>p. 126. Wolfgang Mieder. 1993. ''Proverbs are never out of season.'' New York: Oxford University Press.</ref> The comic strip [[The Argyle Sweater]] showed an Egyptian archeologist loading a mummy on the roof of a vehicle, refusing the offer of a rope to tie it on, with the caption "A fool and his mummy are soon parted."<ref>Aug 26, 2012.</ref> The comic [[One Big Happy (comic strip)|One Big Happy]] showed a conversation where one person repeatedly posed a part of various proverb and the other tried to complete each one, resulting in such humorous results as "Don't change horses... unless you can lift those heavy diapers."<ref>July 8, 2012</ref>

[[Editorial cartoon]]s can use proverbs to make their points with extra force as they can invoke the wisdom of society, not just the opinion of the editors.<ref>Weintraut, Edward James. 1999. "Michel und Mauer": Post-Unification Germany as seen through Editorial Cartoons. Die Unterrichtspraxis 32.2: 143–150.</ref> In an example that invoked a proverb only visually, when a US government agency ([[General Services Administration|GSA]]) was caught spending money extravagantly, a cartoon showed a [[The pot calling the kettle black|black pot]] labeled "Congress" telling a black kettle labeled "[[General Services Administration|GSA]]", "Stop wasting the taxpayers' money!"<ref>Dana Summers, Orlando Sentinel, Aug 20, 2012.</ref> It may have taken some readers a moment of pondering to understand it, but the impact of the message was the stronger for it.

Cartoons with proverbs are so common that Wolfgang Mieder has published a collected volume of them, many of them [[editorial cartoons]]. For example, a German editorial cartoon linked a current politician to the Nazis, showing him with a bottle of swastika-labeled wine and the caption "[[In vino veritas]]".<ref>p. 389. Wolfgang Mieder. 2013. ''Neues von Sisyphus: Sprichwörtliche Mythen der Anike in moderner Literatur, Medien und Karikaturen.'' Bonn: Praesens.</ref>

One cartoonist very self-consciously drew and wrote cartoons based on proverbs for the University of Vermont student newspaper ''The Water Tower'', under the title "Proverb place".<ref>Brienne Toomey. 2013. Old wisdom reimagined: Proverbial cartoons for university students. ''Proverbium'' 30: 333–346.</ref>

Ford once advertised its Thunderbird with, "One drive is worth a thousand words" (Mieder 2004b: 84). This is doubly interesting since the underlying proverb behind this, "One picture is worth a thousand words," was originally introduced into the English proverb repertoire in an ad for televisions (Mieder 2004b: 83).

A few of the many proverbs adapted and used in advertising include:
* "Live by the sauce, dine by the sauce" ([[Buffalo Wild Wings]])
* "At D & D Dogs, you can teach an old dog new tricks" (D & D Dogs)
* "If at first you don't succeed, you're using the wrong equipment" ([[John Deere]])
* "A pfennig saved is a pfennig earned." ([[Volkswagen]])
* "Not only absence makes the heart grow fonder." ([[Godiva Chocolatier]])
* "Where Hogs fly" ([[Grand Prairie AirHogs]]) baseball team
* "Waste not. Read a lot." ([[Half Price Books]])

The [[GEICO]] company has created a series of television ads that are built around proverbs, such as "A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush",<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mScDoJ2wnug |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130727010215/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mScDoJ2wnug |archive-date=2013-07-27 |url-status=dead |title=GEICO Commercial – Bird in Hand |publisher=YouTube |date=2010-08-13 |access-date=2011-11-09}}</ref> and "The pen is mightier than the sword",<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZd-ql7t1I |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110407012901/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZd-ql7t1I |archive-date=2011-04-07 |url-status=dead|title=Is the Pen Mightier? – GEICO Commercial |publisher=YouTube |access-date=2011-11-09}}</ref> "Pigs may fly/[[Flying pig|When pigs fly]]",<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-r4Z1K_LDc |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20121219230903/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-r4Z1K_LDc&gl=US&hl=en |archive-date=2012-12-19 |url-status=dead|title=When pigs fly |publisher=Youtube.com |date=2012-12-18 |access-date=2013-08-30}}</ref> "If a tree falls in the forest...",<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pW2bE61Z9U |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130923224000/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pW2bE61Z9U&gl=US&hl=en |archive-date=2013-09-23 |url-status=dead|title=YouTube|website=www.youtube.com}}</ref> and "Words can never hurt you".<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCysb4_-4jU |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140705130451/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCysb4_-4jU |archive-date=2014-07-05 |url-status=dead|title=YouTube|website=www.youtube.com}}</ref>  Doritos made a commercial based on the proverb, "When pigs fly."<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQo0TfuueaY |archive-url= https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211111/YQo0TfuueaY |archive-date=2021-11-11 |url-status=live |title=When Pigs Fly – Doritos Crash the Super Bowl 2015 Winter Official [sic] |last=Nelson Talbot |date=9 November 2014 |via=YouTube}}{{cbignore}}</ref> Many advertisements that use proverbs shorten or amend them, such as, "Think outside the shoebox."
Use of proverbs in advertising is not limited to the English language. Seda Başer Çoban has studied the use of proverbs in Turkish advertising.<ref>Seda Başer Çoban. 2010. Sözlü Gelenekten Sözün. Geleneksizliğine: Atasözü Ve Reklam [From Oral Tradition to the Traditionless of Speech: Proverb and Advertisement]. ''Millî Folklor''. pp. 22–27.</ref> Tatira has given a number of examples of proverbs used in advertising in Zimbabwe.<ref>Liveson Tatira. 2001. Proverbs in Zimbabwean advertisements. ''Journal of Folklore Research'' 38.3: 229–241.</ref> However, unlike the examples given above in English, all of which are anti-proverbs, Tatira's examples are standard proverbs. Where the English proverbs above are meant to make a potential customer smile, in one of the Zimbabwean examples "both the content of the proverb and the fact that it is phrased as a proverb secure the idea of a secure time-honored relationship between the company and the individuals". When newer buses were imported, owners of older buses compensated by painting a traditional proverb on the sides of their buses, "Going fast does not assure safe arrival".<ref>p. 233. Liveson Tatira. 2001. Proverbs in Zimbabwean advertisements. ''Journal of Folklore Research'' 38.3: 229–241.</ref>

There are often proverbs that contradict each other, such as "Look before you leap" and "He who hesitates is lost", or "Many hands make light work" and "Too many cooks spoil the broth". These have been labeled "counter proverbs"<ref name="Charles Clay Doyle 2012">Charles Clay Doyle. 2012. Counter proverbs.

When there are such counter proverbs, each can be used in its own appropriate situation, and neither is intended to be a universal truth.<ref name="Singh, Anup K 2017">p. 8. Singh, Anup K. 2017.

The concept of "counter proverb" is more about pairs of contradictory proverbs than about the use of proverbs to counter each other in an argument. For example, from the [[Tafi language]] of Ghana, the following pair of proverbs are counter to each other but are each used in appropriate contexts, "A co-wife who is too powerful for you, you address her as your mother" and "Do not call your mother's co-wife your mother..."<ref>p. 425, 421.

[https://openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/bitstream/handle/1887/20916/bookpart.pdf?sequence=23 link to dissertation]</ref> In Nepali, there is a set of totally contradictory proverbs: "Religion is victorious and sin erodes" and "Religion erodes and sin is victorious".<ref>p. 378. Valerie Inchley. 2010. ''Sitting in my house dreaming of Nepal.'' Kathmandu: EKTA.</ref>
Also, the following pair are counter proverbs from the Kasena of Ghana: "It is the patient person who will milk a barren cow" and "The person who would milk a barren cow must prepare for a kick on the forehead".<ref>p. 52, Helen Atawube Yitah. 2006. ''Saying Their Own 'truth': Kasena Women's (de)construction of Gender Through Proverbial Jesting.'' Doctoral dissertation, University of Southern California.</ref> From [[Lugbara language]] (of Uganda and Congo), there are a pair of counter proverbs: "The elephant's tusk does not ovewhelm the elephant" and "The elephant's tusks weigh the elephant down".<ref>p. 83, 84, Dalfovo, A. T. 1987. ''Lugbara Wisdom''. Unisa Press.</ref> The two contradict each other, whether they are used in an argument or not (though indeed they were used in an argument). But the same work contains an appendix with many examples of proverbs used in arguing for contrary positions, but proverbs that are not inherently contradictory,<ref>p. 157–171, Helen Atawube Yitah. 2006. ''Saying Their Own 'truth': Kasena Women's (de)construction of Gender Through Proverbial Jesting.'' Doctoral dissertation, University of Southern California.</ref> such as "One is better off with hope of a cow's return than news of its death" countered by "If you don't know a goat [before its death] you mock at its skin". Though this pair was used in a contradictory way in a conversation, they are not a set of "counter proverbs".<ref name="Singh, Anup K 2017"/>

Discussing counter proverbs in the [[Badaga language]], Hockings explained that in his large collection "a few proverbs are mutually contradictory... we can be sure that the Badagas do not see the matter that way, and would explain such apparent contradictions by reasoning that proverb ''x'' is used in one context, while ''y'' is used in quite another."<ref>Paul Hockings. 1988. ''Counsel from the ancients: A study of Badaga proverbs, prayers, omens, and curses.'' Berlin: Mouton de Gruyter.</ref> Comparing Korean proverbs, "when you compare two proverbs, often they will be contradictory." They are used for "a particular situation".<ref>p. 76. Jeyseon Lee. 2006. "Korean proverbs." In ''Korean language in culture and society,'' ed. by Ho-min Sohn, 74–85. University of Hawai'i Press.</ref>

"Counter proverbs" are not the same as a "paradoxical proverb", a proverb that contains a seeming paradox.<ref>Bendt Alster. 1975. Paradoxical Proverbs and Satire in Sumerian Literature. ''Journal of Cuneiform Studies'' 27.4: 201–230.</ref>

===Metaproverbs===
In many cultures, proverbs are so important and so prominent that there are proverbs about proverbs, that is, "metaproverbs". The most famous one is from [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]] of Nigeria, "Proverbs are the horses of speech, if communication is lost we use proverbs to find it", used by [[Wole Soyinka]] in ''Death and the King's Horsemen''. In Mieder's bibliography of proverb studies, there are twelve publications listed as describing metaproverbs.<ref>p. 1050. Wolfgang Mieder. 2009. ''International Bibliography of Paremiology and Phraseology''. Berlin: Mouton de Gruyter.</ref> Other metaproverbs include:
* As a boy should resemble his father, so should the proverb fit the conversation." (Afar, Ethiopia)<ref>p. 276. Parker, Enid. 1971. Afar stories, riddles, and proverbs. ''Journal of Ethiopian Studies'' 9:219–287.</ref>

There is a growing interest in deliberately using proverbs to achieve goals, usually to support and promote changes in society. Proverbs have also been used for public health promotion, such as promoting breast feeding with a shawl bearing a Swahili proverb "Mother's milk is sweet".<ref>{{cite web |url= http://massbreastfeeding.org/aboutKanga.html |title= About the "Mothers Milk is Sweet" poster|website=massbreastfeeding.org |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130724213805/http://massbreastfeeding.org/aboutKanga.html |archive-date=July 24, 2013}}</ref> Proverbs have also been applied for helping people manage diabetes,<ref>Hendricks, Leo and Rosetta Hendricks. 1994.

The most active field deliberately using proverbs is Christian ministry, where [[Joseph G. Healey]] and others have deliberately worked to catalyze the [[Paremiography|collection of proverbs]] from smaller languages and the application of them in a wide variety of church-related ministries, resulting in publications of collections<ref>Atido, George Pirwoth. 2011.

===Cultural values===
[[File:Study proverb.PNG|thumb|Chinese proverb. It says, "Learn till old, live till old, and there is still three-tenths not learned," meaning that no matter how old you are, there is still more learning or studying left to do.]]
[[File:Better a monk.JPG|thumb|Thai proverb depicted visually at a temple, "Better a monk"]]
There is a longstanding debate among proverb scholars as to whether the cultural values of specific language communities are reflected (to varying degree) in their proverbs. Many claim that the proverbs of a particular culture reflect the values of that specific culture, at least to some degree. Many writers have asserted that the proverbs of their cultures reflect their culture and values; this can be seen in such titles as the following: ''An introduction to Kasena society and culture through their proverbs'',<ref>Albert Kanlisi Awedoba. 2000. ''An Introduction to Kasena Society and Culture Through Their Proverbs''. University Press Of America</ref> Prejudice, power, and poverty in Haiti: a study of a nation's culture as seen through its proverbs,<ref>Linda Tavernier-Almada. 1999.

However, a number of scholars argue that such claims are not valid. They have used a variety of arguments. Grauberg argues that since many proverbs are so widely circulated they are reflections of broad human experience, not any one culture's unique viewpoint.<ref>Walter Grauberg. 1989. Proverbs and idioms: mirrors of national experience? ''Lexicographers and their works'', ed. by Gregory James, 94–99. Exeter: University of Exeter.</ref> Related to this line of argument, from a collection of 199 American proverbs, Jente showed that only 10 were coined in the USA, so that most of these proverbs would not reflect uniquely American values.<ref name="Richard Jente 1932">Richard Jente. 1931–1932. The American Proverb. ''American Speech'' 7:342–348.</ref> Giving another line of reasoning that proverbs should not be trusted as a simplistic guide to cultural values, Mieder once observed "proverbs come and go, that is, antiquated proverbs with messages and images we no longer relate to are dropped from our proverb repertoire, while new proverbs are created to reflect the mores and values of our time",<ref>Wolfgang Mieder. 1993. ''Proverbs are never out of season: Popular wisdom in the modern age''. New York: Oxford University Press.</ref> so old proverbs still in circulation might reflect past values of a culture more than its current values. Also, within any language's proverb repertoire, there may be "counter proverbs", proverbs that contradict each other on the surface<ref name="Charles Clay Doyle 2012"/> (see section above). When examining such counter proverbs, it is difficult to discern an underlying cultural value. With so many barriers to a simple calculation of values directly from proverbs, some feel "one cannot draw conclusions about values of speakers simply from the texts of proverbs".<ref>p. 261. Sw. Anand Prahlad. 1996. ''African American Proverbs in Context''. Jackson: University Press of Mississippi.</ref>

Many outsiders have studied proverbs to discern and understand cultural values and world view of cultural communities.<ref>Niemeyer, Larry L., "Proverbs : tools for world view studies : an exploratory comparison of the Bemba of Zambia and the Shona of Zimbabwe" (1982). Dissertations and Theses. Paper 886. http://pdxscholar.library.pdx.edu/open_access_etds/886</ref> These outsider scholars are confident that they have gained insights into the local cultures by studying proverbs, but this is not universally accepted.<ref name="Richard Jente 1932"/><ref>Grauberg, Walter. 1989. Proverbs and idioms: mirrors of national experience? In ''Lexicographers and their works'', ed. by Gregory James, 94–99. Exeter: University of Exeter.</ref><ref>Whiting, Bartlett J. 1994.

Seeking empirical evidence to evaluate the question of whether proverbs reflect a culture's values, some have counted the proverbs that support various values. For example, Moon lists what he sees as the top ten core cultural values of the [[Builsa]] society of Ghana, as exemplified by proverbs. He found that 18% of the proverbs he analyzed supported the value of being a member of the community, rather than being independent.<ref>p. 134. W. Jay Moon. 2009. ''African Proverbs Reveal Christianity in Culture: A Narrative Portrayal of Builsa Proverbs''. Eugene, OR: Pickwick Publications.</ref> This was corroboration to other evidence that collective community membership is an important value among the Builsa. In studying Tajik proverbs, Bell notes that the proverbs in his corpus "Consistently illustrate Tajik values" and "The most often observed proverbs reflect the focal and specific values" discerned in the thesis.<ref>p. 139 & 157. Evan Bell. 2009. ''An analysis of Tajik proverbs''. Masters thesis, Graduate Institute of Applied Linguistics.</ref>

A study of English proverbs created since 1900 showed in the 1960s a sudden and significant increase in proverbs that reflected more casual attitudes toward sex.<ref>p. 120. Peter Unseth. Review of ''Dictionary of Modern Proverbs''. ''American Speech'' 90.1:117–121.</ref> Since the 1960s was also the decade of the [[Sexual revolution]], this shows a strong statistical link between the changed values of the decades and a change in the proverbs coined and used. Another study mining the same volume counted Anglo-American proverbs about religion to show that proverbs indicate attitudes toward religion are going downhill.<ref>Petrova, Roumyana. 2016. How Religious Are The Modern Anglo-American Proverbs: A Linguocultural Study. ''Proceedings of the world congress of the IASS/AIS'', Editor in Chief: Kristian Bankov. {{ISSN|2414-6862}}. [http://www.iass-ais.org/proceedings2014/view_lesson.php?id=81 Web access]</ref>

There are many examples where cultural values have been explained and illustrated by proverbs. For example, from India, the concept that birth determines one's nature "is illustrated in the oft-repeated proverb: there can be no friendship between grass-eaters and meat-eaters, between a food and its eater".<ref>p. 22, [[Patrick Olivelle]]. 2013. Talking Animals: Explorations in an Indian Literary Genre. ''Religions of South Asia'' 7.14–26.</ref> Proverbs have been used to explain and illustrate the [[Fula people|Fulani]] cultural value of ''pulaaku''.<ref>Rudolf Leger and Abubakar B. Mohammad. 2000. The concept of pulaaku mirrored in Fulfulde proverbs of the Gombe dialect. ''Berichte des Sonderforschungsbereichs'' 268, Band 14, Frankfurt a.M. 2000: 299–306.</ref> But using proverbs to ''illustrate'' a cultural value is not the same as using a collection of proverbs to ''discern'' cultural values. In a comparative study between Spanish and Jordanian proverbs it is defined the social imagination for the mother as an archetype in the context of role transformation and in contrast with the roles of husband, son and brother, in two societies which might be occasionally associated with sexist and /or rural ideologies.<ref>Sbaihat, Ahlam (2012). La imagen de la madre en el refranero español y jordano. Estudio de Paremiología comparada. España: Sociedad Española de Estudios Literarios de Cultura Popular, Oceanide, 5.</ref>

Some scholars have adopted a cautious approach, acknowledging at least a genuine, though limited, link between cultural values and proverbs: "The cultural portrait painted by proverbs may be fragmented, contradictory, or otherwise at variance with reality... but must be regarded not as accurate renderings but rather as tantalizing shadows of the culture which spawned them."<ref>p. 173.Sheila K. Webster. 1982. Women, Sex, and Marriage in Moroccan Proverbs. ''International Journal of Middle East Studies'' 14:173–184.</ref> There is not yet agreement on the issue of whether, and how much, cultural values are reflected in a culture's proverbs.

It is clear that the Soviet Union believed that proverbs had a direct link to the values of a culture, as they used them to try to create changes in the values of cultures within their sphere of domination. Sometimes they took old Russian proverbs and altered them into socialist forms.<ref>p. 84ff. Andrey Reznikov. 2009. ''Old wine in new bottles: Modern Russian anti-proverbs.'' (Supplement Series of ''Proverbium'', 27.) Burlington, VT: University of Vermont</ref> These new proverbs promoted Socialism and its attendant values, such as atheism and collectivism, e.g. "Bread is given to us not by Christ, but by machines and collective farms" and "A good harvest is had only by a collective farm." They did not limit their efforts to Russian, but also produced "newly coined proverbs that conformed to socialist thought" in Tajik and other languages of the USSR.<ref>Evan Bell. 2009. ''An analysis of Tajik proverbs''. Masters thesis, Graduate Institute of Applied Linguistics.</ref>
[[File:Proverb scroll.PNG|thumb|left|Scroll of the Biblical [[Book of Proverbs]]]]

===Religion===
Many proverbs from around the world address matters of ethics and expected of behavior. Therefore, it is not surprising that proverbs are often important texts in religions. The most obvious example is the [[Book of Proverbs]] in the Bible. Additional proverbs have also been coined to support religious values, such as the following from [[Dari Persian|Dari]] of Afghanistan:<ref>p. 54, J. Christy Wilson, Jr. 2004. ''One hundred Afghan Persian proverbs'' 3rd, edition. Peshawar, Pakistan: InterLit Foundation.</ref> "In childhood you're playful, In youth you're lustful, In old age you're feeble, So when will you before God be worshipful?"

Clearly proverbs in religion are not limited to monotheists; among the [[Badagas]] of India ([[Shaivism|Sahivite]] Hindus), there is a traditional proverb "Catch hold of and join with the man who has placed sacred ash [on himself]."<ref>p. 601, Paul Hockings. 1988. ''Counsel from the Ancients: A study of Badaga proverbs, prayers, omens and curses''. Berlin: de Gruyter.</ref>  Proverbs are widely associated with large religions that draw from sacred books, but they are also used for religious purposes among groups with their own traditional religions, such as the Guji Oromo.<ref name="Tadesse Jaleta Jirata 2009"/> The broadest comparative study of proverbs across religions is ''The eleven religions and their proverbial lore, a comparative study. A reference book to the eleven surviving major religions of the world'' by Selwyn Gurney Champion, from 1945. Some sayings from sacred books also become proverbs, even if they were not obviously proverbs in the original passage of the sacred book.<ref>Ziyad Mohammad Gogazeh and Ahmad Husein Al-Afif. 2007. Los proverbios árabes extraidos del ''Corán'': recopilación, traducción, y estudio. ''Paremia'' 16: 129–138.</ref> For example, many quote "Be sure your sin will find you out" as a proverb from the Bible, but there is no evidence it was proverbial in its original usage ([[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] 32:23).

Not all religious references in proverbs are positive. Some are cynical, such as the Tajik, "Do as the mullah says, not as he does."<ref>p. 130, Evan Bell. 2009. ''The wit and wisdom of the Tajiks: An analysis of Tajik proverbs''.

Proverbs do not have to explicitly mention religion or religious figures to be used to mock a religion, seen in the fact that in a collection of 555 proverbs from the [[Lur people|Lur]], a Muslim group in Iran, the explanations for 15 of them use illustrations that mock Muslim clerics.<ref>Peter Unseth (2017).

==Paremiology==
{{main|Paremiology}}
[[File:Books on proverb study.jpg|thumb|A sample of books used in the study of proverbs.]]
The study of proverbs is called '''paremiology''' which has a variety of uses in the study of such topics as [[philosophy]], [[linguistics]], and [[folklore]]. There are several types and styles of proverbs which are analyzed within Paremiology as is the use and misuse of familiar expressions which are not strictly 'proverbial' in the dictionary definition of being fixed sentences

===Paremiological minimum===
Grigorii Permjakov<ref>{{Cite web|url= http://www2.arnes.si/~bridges/proverb_wisdom.htm|title=Photo and Web page about Permjakov}}</ref> developed the concept of the core set of proverbs that full members of society know, what he called the "paremiological minimum" (1979). For example, an adult American is expected to be familiar with "Birds of a feather flock together", part of the American paremiological minimum. However, an average adult American is not expected to know "Fair in the cradle, foul in the saddle", an old English proverb that is not part of the current American paremiological minimum. Thinking more widely than merely proverbs, Permjakov observed "every adult Russian language speaker (over 20 years of age) knows no fewer than 800 proverbs, proverbial expressions, popular literary quotations and other forms of cliches".<ref>p. 91 Grigorii L'vovich Permiakov. 1989.

===Sources for proverb study===
A seminal work in the study of proverbs is Archer Taylor's ''The Proverb'' (1931), later republished by [[Wolfgang Mieder]] with Taylor's Index included (1985/1934). A good introduction to the study of proverbs is Mieder's 2004 volume, ''Proverbs: A Handbook''. Mieder has also published a series of bibliography volumes on proverb research, as well as a large number of articles and other books in the field. Stan Nussbaum has edited a large collection on proverbs of Africa, published on a CD, including reprints of out-of-print collections, original collections, and works on analysis, bibliography, and application of proverbs to Christian ministry (1998).<ref>Mbiti, John. 2002.

The study of proverbs has been built by a number of notable scholars and contributors. Earlier scholars were more concerned with collecting than analyzing. [[Desiderius Erasmus]] was a Latin scholar (1466–1536), whose collection of Latin proverbs, known as ''[[Adagia]]'', spread Latin proverbs across Europe.<ref>Erasmus, Desiderius. Adages in Collected Works of Erasmus. Trans. R.A.B Mynors et al. Volumes 31–36. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1982–2006.</ref> [[Juan de Mal Lara]] was a 16th century Spanish scholar, one of his books being 1568 ''Philosophia vulgar'', the first part of which contains one thousand and one sayings. Hernán Núñez published a collection of Spanish proverbs (1555).

In the 19th century, a growing number of scholars published collections of proverbs, such as [[Samuel Adalberg]] who published collections of Yiddish proverbs (1888 & 1890) and Polish proverbs (1889–1894). [[Samuel Ajayi Crowther]], the [[Anglican]] bishop in Nigeria, published a collection of [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]] proverbs (1852). [[Elias Lönnrot]] published a collection of Finnish proverbs (1842).

From the 20th century onwards, proverb scholars were involved in not only collecting proverbs, but also analyzing and comparing proverbs. [[Alan Dundes]] was a 20th century American folklorist whose scholarly output on proverbs led Wolfgang Mieder to refer to him as a "pioneering paremiologist".<ref>{{Cite web |url= https://www.folklore.ee/folklore/vol35/mieder.pdf |title=Alan Dundes as Pioneering Paremiologist}}</ref> [[Matti Kuusi]] was a 20th century Finnish paremiologist, the creator of the Matti Kuusi international type system of proverbs.<ref>Lauhakangas, Outi. 2013.

Current proverb scholars have continued the trend to be involved in analysis as well as collection of proverbs.
