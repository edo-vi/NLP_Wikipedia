'''Geo Cronjé''' (born 23 July 1980) is a South African former [[rugby union]] international.

Cronjé, raised in [[Klerksdorp]], is the elder brother of Springbok [[Jacques Cronjé]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Jones |first1=Chris |title=Cronje: 'Just take me as I am' |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/cronje-just-take-me-as-i-am-6957750.html |work=[[Evening Standard]] |date=14 April 2012 |language=en}}</ref>

A lock, Cronjé made his Springboks debut against New Zealand at Carisbrook in the [[2003 Tri Nations Series]]. His career was subsequently impacted by accusations that during a pre-World Cup camp he had refused to share a room with coloured team-mate [[Quinton Davids]] on the basis of race. He was booted from the camp as a result and omitted from the final World Cup squad. Multiple enquiries later cleared him of racism.<ref>{{cite news |title=South Africa's Cronje not guilty of racism |url=https://www.independent.ie/sport/rugby/south-africas-cronje-not-guilty-of-racism/25929213.html |work=[[Irish Independent]] |date=2 September 2003 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Springbock lock cleared of racism |url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2004-03-10/springbock-lock-cleared-of-racism/149234 |work=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]]|date=9 March 2004 |language=en-AU}}</ref>

Cronjé earned two further Springboks caps in 2004. At the end of the year he signed a contract to play in England for [[Harlequin F.C.|Harlequins]] but due to a knee injury ended up being released without playing a game.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Rees |first1=Paul |title=Cronje released after no Quins games |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2005/jan/27/rugbyunion.harlequinsru |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=27 January 2005}}</ref>
