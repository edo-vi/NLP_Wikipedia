'''Marryoke''' is a wedding (or event) music video that is filmed during the day with the Bride & Groom and their guests. The footage is edited together to give the illusion that participants are singing the song themselves. Such a video clip is  a documentation and performance of a song, that traditionally is produced at a [[wedding]] by a [[wedding videographer]].

The phrase Marryoke is a play on the word [[karaoke]] due to their similarities; however a marryoke involves no actual singing from the participants being included in the final edit as the participants singing is lip synced to the original artist in editing. Marryoke has become popular as a form of wedding entertainment fun for guests.<ref>{{citation |url=https://spencefrederick.co.uk/|title=Spence Frederick Wedding Photography|accessdate=2021-08-21}}</ref><ref>{{citation |url=https://lessiebluephotography.com/|title=Lessie Blue Photography|accessdate=2021-09-27}}</ref>
