===Analysis===
Linguist [[John McWhorter]] analyzed the linguistic attributes of the chant in ''[[The Atlantic]]'', likening the use of "Brandon" to a ''[[hlonipha]]'' {{endash}} a substitution of a forbidden word. He wrote that the anti-Biden euphemism has a similar tone to the word [[SNAFU]], which stands for "Situation Normal â€“ All Fucked Up", or to the word "[[cuckservative]]s" (a [[portmanteau]] of "[[cuckold]]" and "[[Conservatism in the United States|conservatives]]") which is used by some [[American nationalism|nationalist]]s or [[paleoconservative]]s to describe neoconservatives perceived as being in fact [[liberalism|liberals]]. McWhorter described the Let's Go Brandon phenomenon as "simply fascinating", and a "wild, woolly kink in the intersection of language, politics, wit, and creativity."<ref>{{cite news|last=McWhorter|first=John|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/11/lets-go-brandon-biden-linguistics/620652|title=The Serendipity of 'Let's Go, Brandon'|work=[[The Atlantic]]|date=2021-11-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211110230556/https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/11/lets-go-brandon-biden-linguistics/620652|archive-date=2021-11-10|access-date=2021-11-11}}</ref>

After the president fell off his bike in [[Rehoboth Beach, Delaware]] in June 2022, a [[Google Maps]] user listed the spot as a historical landmark on Google maps named Brandon Falls. However, "Brandon Falls" is not an official landmark named by the state of Delaware. Google reverted the landmark shortly afterwards.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.snopes.com/news/2022/07/19/biden-brandon-falls|title=Brandon Falls, a Google Maps Landmark|date=July 19, 2022|publisher=[[Snopes]]}}</ref>

In 2022, a then-nine-year-old [[autistic]] boy named Brandon Brundidge saw a sign with the phrase; not knowing the political meaning, he assumed that they were supporting him. It inspired him to try swimming and biking without training wheels. His mother, [[Sheletta Brundidge]], wrote a book called ''Brandon Spots his Sign'', and they later met Brandon Brown.<ref>{{cite web|author=AJ Willingham|date=July 17, 2022|title=How an author, a NASCAR star and a young boy flipped 'Let's Go Brandon' on its head|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2022/07/17/us/lets-go-brandon-brundidge-nascar-book-good-news-cec/index.html|access-date=October 4, 2022|website=edition.[[CNN]].com|language=en|archive-date=July 17, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220717094459/https://edition.cnn.com/2022/07/17/us/lets-go-brandon-brundidge-nascar-book-good-news-cec/index.html|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|first=Danielle|last=Campoamor|date=June 13, 2022|title=How the phrase 'Let's go Brandon' made a little boy with autism feel loved|url=https://www.today.com/parents/parents/phrase-go-brandon-made-one-little-boy-autism-feel-loved-rcna33287|access-date=October 4, 2022|website=[[Today (American TV program)|Today]]|archive-date=June 13, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220613200314/https://www.today.com/parents/parents/phrase-go-brandon-made-one-little-boy-autism-feel-loved-rcna33287|url-status=live}}</ref>
