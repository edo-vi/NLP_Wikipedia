{{Short description|UK music video chart}}
The '''UK Video Charts'''  is a group of charts compiled by the [[Official Charts Company]] on behalf of The British Association for Screen Entertainment. The charts are based on weekly [[DVD]], [[Blu-ray]] and, formerly, [[VHS]] sales in 6,500 retailers across the UK. The main chart combines the sales of all video sales in the UK and trades under the name of the '''Combined Video Chart'''. There are also charts for the sales of [[music video]]s ('''Music Video Chart''') and children's videos, among others. All of the charts are published on the OCC's website.
