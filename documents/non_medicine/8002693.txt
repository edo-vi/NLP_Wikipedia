'''''Corynebacterium bovis''''' is a pathogenic  [[bacterium]] that causes [[Mastitis (domestic animals)|mastitis]] and [[pyelonephritis]] in cattle.

''C. bovis'' is a [[Facultative anaerobic organism|facultatively anaerobic]],  [[Gram-positive]] organism, characterized by nonencapsulated, nonsporulated, immobile, straight or curved rods with a length of 1 to 8&nbsp;µm and width of 0.3 to 0.8&nbsp;µm, which forms ramified aggregations in culture (looking like "Chinese characters"). 

In mastitic infections, ''C. bovis'' is spread from cow to cow most commonly through improper milking technique.<ref>{{cite web | title = Mastitis in Cattle: Overview | work = The Merck Veterinary Manual | date = 2006 | url = http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.jsp?cfile=htm/bc/110902.htm | accessdate = 2007-06-05 }}</ref> However, it is usually a mild infection resulting in an elevated [[somatic cell count]].
The bacterium is sensitive to the majority of [[antibiotics]], such as the [[penicillin]]s, [[ampicillin]], [[cephalosporin]]s, [[Quinolone antibiotic|quinolones]], [[chloramphenicol]], [[tetracycline]]s, [[cefuroxime]], and [[trimethoprim]].
