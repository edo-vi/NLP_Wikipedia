==Critical response==
Emi Kolawole of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' said, "Breaks's message taps into a very fundamental desire among young people to disrupt — that word ubiquitous to innovation — the educational system."<ref name="washingtonpost"/> Steven Kalas of the ''[[Las Vegas Review-Journal]]'' said, "Breaks's motif is rhythmic, staccato narrative. But it's absent the percussive, droning cacophony accompanying most of rap or hip-hop."<ref name="reviewjournal">{{cite news |last=Kalas|first=Steven|url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/columns-blogs/steven-kalas/suli-breaks-disdain-education-saddening|title=Suli Breaks' disdain for education saddening|newspaper=[[Las Vegas Review-Journal]] |date=7 December 2013|accessdate=1 July 2015}}</ref>
