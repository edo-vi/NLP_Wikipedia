The '''Moerman Therapy''', also called Moerman Method or Moerman Diet is a purported cancer treatment from the Dutch practitioner {{ill|Cornelis Moerman|nl}} (1893â€“1988). Its effectiveness is supported by anecdote only&nbsp;&ndash; there is no evidence of its worth as a cancer treatment.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://paseka.us/alternative-cancer/ |title=Alternative cancer treatment |accessdate=2011-03-13|publisher=National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health}}</ref><ref name=qw>{{cite web

==History==

Moerman who experimented with pigeons in the 1930s argued that he had identified "mysterious suppressors" of the cancer cell and there are "eight
essential substances" that maintain human health.<ref name=qw/> He claimed that deficiency of these substances leads to metabolic disturbances and anomalies of regeneration tissue that enable microorganisms which he termed "symbionts" to convert healthy cells into cancer cells.<ref name=qw/>

According to [[Quackwatch]] the Moerman diet is a [[Lacto vegetarianism|lacto-vegetarian]] diet that "prohibited all meats, all fish and shellfish, alcohol, animal fats, artificial colorings, beans, peas, lentils, mushrooms, potatoes, red cabbage, {{sic|nolink=yes|saurkraut}}, cheeses with high fat and salt content, {{sic|nolink=yes|margerine}} and other hydrogenated oils, coffee, cocoa or {{sic|nolink=yes|caffeine containing}} teas, egg whites, sugar, salt, white flour, and tobacco."<ref name=qw/> The alleged "symbionts" that Moerman proposed have never been shown to exist.<ref name=qw/>

In 2000, Moerman's invention of the diet earned him a place at the head of "a list of the twenty biggest [[quackery|quacks]] of the twentieth century" as decided by the Dutch Union Against Quackery.<ref>''Dutch Quackbuster chooses biggest quacks of the 20th century''.
