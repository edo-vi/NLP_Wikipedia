'''Myr''' is an abbreviation for '''million years''', a [[unit of time]] equal to {{val|fmt=commas|1000000|u=years}} (i.e. {{val|1|e=6}} years), or 31.556926 [[Terasecond and longer#Teraseconds|teraseconds]].
It is equivalent to one ''[[megaannum]]'' (symbol Ma), based on the [[metric prefix]] [[mega-]].

==Usage==
Myr (million years) is in common use in fields such as [[Earth science]] and [[cosmology]]. Myr is also used with '''Mya''' or '''Ma''' (million years ago). Together they make a reference system, one to a quantity, the other to a particular place in a [[calendar era|year numbering system]] that is ''time before the present''.

Myr is deprecated in [[geology]], but in [[astronomy]] ''Myr'' is standard. Where "myr" ''is'' seen in geology it is usually "Myr" (a unit of mega-years). In astronomy it is usually "Myr" (Million years).

== Debate ==
In geology a debate remains open concerning the use of ''Myr'' (duration) plus ''Ma'' (million years ago) versus using only the term ''Ma''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Mozley|first=Peter|title=Discussion of GSA Time Unit Conventions|url=https://www.geosociety.org/TimeUnits/|work=web page|publisher=[[Geological Society of America]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303232640/https://www.geosociety.org/TimeUnits/|archive-date=2016-03-03}}</ref><ref name="Biever-war">{{cite journal |first=Celeste |last=Biever |title=Push to define year sparks time war |journal=[[New Scientist]] |volume=210 |issue=2810 |pages=10 |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn20423-push-to-define-year-sparks-time-war.html |date=April 27, 2011 |access-date=April 28, 2011|bibcode=2011NewSc.210R..10B |doi=10.1016/S0262-4079(11)60955-X }}</ref> In either case the term ''[[Year#SI prefix multipliers|Ma]]'' is used in geology literature conforming to [[ISO 31-1]] (now [[ISO 80000-3]]) and NIST 811 recommended practices. Traditional style geology literature is written {{Quote|The Cretaceous started 145 Ma and ended 66 Ma, lasting for 79 Myr.}}
The "ago" is implied, so that any such year number "X Ma" between 66 and 145 is "Cretaceous", for good reason. But the counter argument is that having ''myr'' for a duration and ''Mya'' for an age mixes unit systems, and tempts capitalization errors: "million" need not be capitalized, but "mega" must be; "ma" would technically imply a ''milliyear'' (a thousandth of a year, or 8 hours). On this side of the debate, one avoids ''myr'' and simply adds ''ago'' explicitly (or adds ''[[Before Present|BP]]''), as in {{Quote|The Cretaceous started 145 Ma ago and ended 66 Ma ago, lasting for 79 Ma.}}
In this case, "79 Ma" means only a quantity of 79 million years, without the meaning of "79 million years ago".
