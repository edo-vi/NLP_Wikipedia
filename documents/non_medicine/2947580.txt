'''Rodent cocktail''' is an [[anesthetic]] mixture used for [[rodents]] in research. The injectable, clear liquid is a mixture of [[ketamine]], [[xylazine]], and [[acepromazine]].<ref>{{Citation |year= 2012 |title= STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE NO. 1 ANESTHESIA AND ANALGESIA IN RODENTS|publisher= Washington College|pages= 1â€“2|url= https://www.washcoll.edu/live/files/1227-no-1-anesthesia-sop-revised-1012pdf|accessdate= 27 November 2015}}</ref> The ratio used depends on the [[species]] of rodent.
