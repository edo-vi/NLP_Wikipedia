The '''quaternary prevention''', concept coined by the Belgian [[general practitioner]] Marc Jamoulle,<ref>[http://docpatient.net/mj/IIMG_1986.pdf Jamoulle M. Information et informatisation en médecine générale. In: Berleur J, Labet-Maris Cl, Poswick RF, Valenduc G, Van Bastelaer Ph. Les informa-g-iciens. Namur (Belgique): Presses Universitaires de Namur; 1986. p.193-209.]{{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> are the actions taken to identify a [[patient]] at risk of [[medicalisation|overmedicalisation]], to protect them from new medical invasion, and to suggest  interventions which are ethically acceptable.<ref>[http://docpatient.net/mj/P4_citations.htm Jamoulle M.

Quaternary prevention is the set of health activities to mitigate or avoid the consequences of unnecessary or excessive intervention of the [[health system]].<ref>[http://www.equipocesca.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/2004-06-la-prevencion-cuaternaria.pdf Gervás J.

== Explanation of term ==
Marc Jamoulle divided medical situations into four quadrants based on if the patient was experiencing illness (i.e. if the patient experienced subjective poor health) and if the doctor had identified disease (constructed based on diagnostic criteria), with a different type of prevention happening in each:
# [[Preventive healthcare#Primary_prevention|Primary]] prevention when both illness and disease are absent
# [[Preventive healthcare#Secondary_prevention|Secondary]] prevention when illness is absent but disease is present
# [[Preventive healthcare#Tertiary_prevention|Tertiary]] prevention when both illness and disease are present
# Quaternary prevention when the patient is experiencing illness but there is no identified disease

Jamoulle noted that when the patient was experiencing illness but no specific disease had been identified that patient was particularly vulnerable to their condition being made worse by invasive or harmful diagnostic medical intervention.

This original explanation is more limited than the more general term listed in the Wonca International Dictionary for General/Family Practice, "action taken to identify patient at risk of overmedicalisation, to protect him from new medical invasion, and to suggest to him interventions, which are ethically acceptable".<ref name="Wonca dictionary">{{cite book |last1=Bentzen |first1=Niels |title=Wonca dictionary of general/family practice |date=2003 |publisher=Wonca International Classification Committee |location=[S.l.] |isbn=8788638227 |page=115 |url=http://www.ph3c.org/ph3c/docs/27/000092/0000052.pdf |access-date=30 May 2022}}</ref>
