'''Evidence-based medicine''' ('''EBM''') is "the conscientious, explicit and judicious use of current best evidence in making decisions about the care of individual patients."<ref name=sackett2 /> The aim of EBM is to integrate the experience of the clinician, the values of the patient, and the best available scientific information to guide decision-making about clinical management. The term was originally used to describe an approach to teaching the practice of medicine and improving decisions by individual physicians about individual patients.<ref name="Guyatt">{{cite journal | title = Evidence-based medicine.

== Background, history, and definition ==
Medicine has a long history of scientific inquiry about the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of human disease.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Brater DC, Daly WJ | title = Clinical pharmacology in the Middle Ages: principles that presage the 21st century | journal = Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics | volume = 67 | issue = 5 | pages = 447–450 | date = May 2000 | pmid = 10824622 | doi = 10.1067/mcp.2000.106465 | s2cid = 45980791 }}</ref><ref name="pmid11058989">{{cite journal | vauthors = Daly WJ, Brater DC | title = Medieval contributions to the search for truth in clinical medicine | journal = Perspectives in Biology and Medicine | volume = 43 | issue = 4 | pages = 530–540 | year = 2000 | pmid = 11058989 | doi = 10.1353/pbm.2000.0037 | s2cid = 30485275 }}</ref> In the 11th century AD, [[Avicenna]], a Persian physician and philosopher, developed an approach to EBM that was mostly similar to current ideas and practises.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Shoja MM, Rashidi MR, Tubbs RS, Etemadi J, Abbasnejad F, Agutter PS | title = Legacy of Avicenna and evidence-based medicine | journal = International Journal of Cardiology | volume = 150 | issue = 3 | pages = 243–246 | date = August 2011 | pmid = 21093081 | doi = 10.1016/j.ijcard.2010.10.019 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Akhondzadeh S | title = Avicenna and evidence based medicine | journal = Avicenna Journal of Medical Biotechnology | volume = 6 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–2 | date = January 2014 | pmid = 24523951 | pmc = 3895573 }}</ref>

The concept of a controlled clinical trial was first described in 1662 by [[Jan Baptist van Helmont]] in reference to the practice of [[bloodletting]].<ref>{{cite book |author=John Baptista Van Helmont |title=Oriatrike, or Physick Refined (English translation of Ortus medicinae) |year=1662 |translator=John Chandler |url=https://wellcomecollection.org/works/jh9aanrn}}</ref> Wrote Van Helmont:
{{Blockquote
|text=Let us take out of the Hospitals, out of the Camps, or from elsewhere, 200, or 500 poor People, that have fevers or Pleuritis. Let us divide them in Halfes, let us cast lots, that one halfe of them may fall to my share, and the others to yours; I will cure them without blood-letting and sensible evacuation; but you do, as ye know ... we shall see how many Funerals both of us shall have...
}}

The first published report describing the conduct and results of a controlled clinical trial was by [[James Lind]], a Scottish naval surgeon who conducted research on [[scurvy]] during his time aboard [[HMS Salisbury (1746)|HMS ''Salisbury'']] in the [[Channel Fleet]], while patrolling the [[Bay of Biscay]]. Lind divided the sailors participating in his experiment into six groups, so that the effects of various treatments could be fairly compared. Lind found improvement in symptoms and signs of scurvy among the group of men treated with lemons or oranges. He published a treatise describing the results of this experiment in 1753.<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Lind J |title=Treatise on the scurvy|publisher=Gale Ecco |location=|year=2018 |isbn=978-1-379-46980-3}}</ref>

=== Clinical decision-making ===
[[Alvan Feinstein]]'s publication of ''Clinical Judgment'' in 1967 focused attention on the role of clinical reasoning and identified biases that can affect it.<ref name="feinstein">{{cite book |author=Alvan R.

=== Evidence-based guidelines and policies ===
{{Main|Medical guideline}}
David M. Eddy first began to use the term 'evidence-based' in 1987 in workshops and a manual commissioned by the Council of Medical Specialty Societies to teach formal methods for designing clinical practice guidelines. The manual was eventually published by the American College of Physicians.<ref name="eddy1992">{{cite book |author=Eddy DM |title=A Manual for Assessing Health Practices and Designing Practice Policies |publisher=American College of Physicians|date=1992 |isbn=978-0-943126-18-0 }}</ref><ref name="field">{{cite book|author=Institute of Medicine| veditors = Field MJ, Lohr KN |title=Clinical Practice Guidelines: Directions for a New Program |location=Washington, DC|publisher=National Academy of Sciences Press|year=1990|isbn=978-0-309-07666-1|page=32|url= http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=1626&page=32 |doi=10.17226/1626|pmid=25144032 |pmc=5310095}}</ref> Eddy first published the term 'evidence-based' in March 1990, in an article in the ''Journal of the American Medical Association'' that laid out the principles of evidence-based guidelines and population-level policies, which Eddy described as "explicitly describing the available evidence that pertains to a policy and tying the policy to evidence instead of standard-of-care practices or the beliefs of experts. The pertinent evidence must be identified, described, and analyzed. The policymakers must determine whether the policy is justified by the evidence. A rationale must be written."<ref name="eddy6" /> He discussed evidence-based policies in several other papers published in ''JAMA'' in the spring of 1990.<ref name="eddy6">{{cite journal | vauthors = Eddy DM | title = Clinical decision making: from theory to practice.

=== Medical education ===
The term 'evidence-based medicine' was introduced slightly later, in the context of medical education. In the autumn of 1990, [[Gordon Guyatt]] used it in an unpublished description of a program at [[McMaster University]] for prospective or new medical students.<ref name="howick">{{cite book | vauthors = Howick JH |title=The Philosophy of Evidence-based Medicine |publisher=Wiley |page=15 |isbn=978-1-4443-4266-6 |date=23 February 2011}}</ref> Guyatt and others first published the term two years later (1992) to describe a new approach to teaching the practice of medicine.<ref name="Guyatt" />

In 1996, David Sackett and colleagues clarified the definition of this tributary of evidence-based medicine as "the conscientious, explicit and judicious use of current best evidence in making decisions about the care of individual patients. ... [It] means integrating individual clinical expertise with the best available external clinical evidence from systematic research."<ref name="sackett2">{{cite journal | vauthors = Sackett DL, Rosenberg WM, Gray JA, Haynes RB, Richardson WS | title = Evidence based medicine: what it is and what it isn't | journal = BMJ | volume = 312 | issue = 7023 | pages = 71–72 | date = January 1996 | pmid = 8555924 | pmc = 2349778 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.312.7023.71 }}</ref> This branch of evidence-based medicine aims to make individual decision making more structured and objective by better reflecting the evidence from research.<ref name="katz">{{cite book | vauthors = Katz DL |title=Clinical Epidemiology & Evidence-Based Medicine: Fundamental Principles of Clinical Reasoning & Research|url=https://archive.org/details/clinicalepidemio0000katz |url-access=registration |year=2001|publisher=Sage|isbn=978-0-7619-1939-1}}</ref><ref name="grobbee">{{cite book | vauthors = Grobbee DE, Hoes AW | title=Clinical Epidemiology: Principles, Methods, and Applications for Clinical Research|year=2009|publisher=Jones & Bartlett Learning| isbn=978-0-7637-5315-3}}</ref> Population-based data are applied to the care of an individual patient,<ref name="doi">{{cite book| vauthors = Doi SA |title=Understanding Evidence in Health Care: Using Clinical Epidemiology|year=2012|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=South Yarra, VIC, Australia|isbn=978-1-4202-5669-7}}</ref> while respecting the fact that practitioners have clinical expertise reflected in effective and efficient diagnosis and thoughtful identification and compassionate use of individual patients' predicaments, rights, and preferences.<ref name=sackett2 />

Between 1993 and 2000, the Evidence-Based Medicine Working Group at McMaster University published the methods to a broad physician audience in a series of 25 "Users' Guides to the Medical Literature" in ''JAMA''. In 1995 Rosenberg and Donald defined individual-level, evidence-based medicine as "the process of finding, appraising, and using contemporaneous research findings as the basis for medical decisions."<ref name="rosenberg2">{{cite journal | vauthors = Rosenberg W, Donald A | title = Evidence based medicine: an approach to clinical problem-solving | journal = BMJ | volume = 310 | issue = 6987 | pages = 1122–1126 | date = April 1995 | pmid = 7742682 | pmc = 2549505 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.310.6987.1122 }}</ref> In 2010, [[Trisha Greenhalgh|Greenhalgh]] used a definition that emphasized quantitative methods: "the use of mathematical estimates of the risk of benefit and harm, derived from high-quality research on population samples, to inform clinical decision-making in the diagnosis, investigation or management of individual patients."<ref name="greenhalgh1">{{cite book| vauthors = Greenhalgh T |author-link=Trisha Greenhalgh|date=2010|title=How to Read a Paper: The Basics of Evidence-Based Medicine | edition = 4th |url=https://archive.org/details/howtoreadpaperba00tgre |url-access=limited |publisher= John Wiley & Sons|page= [https://archive.org/details/howtoreadpaperba00tgre/page/n20 1]|isbn=978-1-4443-9036-0}}</ref><ref name=sackett2 />

The two original definitions{{which|date=June 2017}} highlight important differences in how evidence-based medicine is applied to populations versus individuals. When designing guidelines applied to large groups of people in settings with relatively little opportunity for modification by individual physicians, evidence-based policymaking emphasizes that good evidence should exist to document a test's or treatment's effectiveness.<ref name="Eddy1990">{{cite journal | vauthors = Eddy DM | title = Practice policies: where do they come from? | journal = JAMA | volume = 263 | issue = 9 | pages = 1265, 1269, 1272 passim | date = March 1990 | pmid = 2304243 | doi = 10.1001/jama.263.9.1265 }}</ref> In the setting of individual decision-making, practitioners can be given greater latitude in how they interpret research and combine it with their clinical judgment.<ref name=sackett2 /><ref name="greenhalgh2">{{cite journal | vauthors = Tonelli MR | title = The limits of evidence-based medicine | journal = Respiratory Care | volume = 46 | issue = 12 | pages = 1435–1440 | date = December 2001 | pmid = 11728302 | author-link = Trisha Greenhalgh }}</ref> In 2005, Eddy offered an umbrella definition for the two branches of EBM: "Evidence-based medicine is a set of principles and methods intended to ensure that to the greatest extent possible, medical decisions, guidelines, and other types of policies are based on and consistent with good evidence of effectiveness and benefit."<ref name="eddybmapproach">{{cite journal | vauthors = Eddy DM | title = Evidence-based medicine: a unified approach | journal = Health Affairs | volume = 24 | issue = 1 | pages = 9–17 | date = 2005 | pmid = 15647211 | doi = 10.1377/hlthaff.24.1.9 | doi-access =  }}</ref>

=== Progress ===
In the area of evidence-based guidelines and policies, the explicit insistence on evidence of effectiveness was introduced by the American Cancer Society in 1980.<ref name="guidelines">{{cite journal | vauthors = Eddy D | title = ACS report on the cancer-related health checkup | journal = CA | volume = 30 | issue = 4 | pages = 193–240 | year = 1980 | pmid = 6774802 | doi = 10.3322/canjclin.30.4.194 | s2cid = 221546339 | doi-access =  }}</ref> The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) began issuing guidelines for preventive interventions based on evidence-based principles in 1984.<ref name="taskforce">{{cite web|url=http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/about.htm|title=About the USPSTF|access-date=21 August 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140815122438/http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/about.htm|archive-date=15 August 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> In 1985, the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association applied strict evidence-based criteria for covering new technologies.<ref name="rettig">{{cite book | vauthors = Rettig RA, Jacobson PD, Farquhar CM, Aubry WM |title=False Hope: Bone Marrow Transplantation for Breast Cancer: Bone Marrow Transplantation for Breast Cancer |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bbcTZLRRVmoC&pg=PA183 |date=2007 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-974824-2 |pages=183}}</ref> Beginning in 1987, specialty societies such as the American College of Physicians, and voluntary health organizations such as the American Heart Association, wrote many evidence-based guidelines.

=== Current practice ===
By 2000, use of the term ''evidence-based'' had extended to other levels of the health care system. An example is evidence-based health services, which seek to increase the competence of health service decision makers and the practice of evidence-based medicine at the organizational or institutional level.<ref name="gray">{{cite book|author=Gray, J. A. Muir|date=2009|title=Evidence-based Health Care & Public Health|publisher=Churchill Livingstone|isbn=978-0-443-10123-6}}</ref>

The multiple tributaries of evidence-based medicine share an emphasis on the importance of incorporating evidence from formal research in medical policies and decisions. However, because they differ on the extent to which they require good evidence of effectiveness before promoting a guideline or payment policy, a distinction is sometimes made between evidence-based medicine and science-based medicine, which also takes into account factors such as prior plausibility and compatibility with established science (as when medical organizations promote controversial treatments such as [[acupuncture]]).<ref name="AAFP2018">{{cite web |title=AAFP promotes acupuncture |publisher=Science-Based Medicine |date=9 October 2018 |url=https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/aafp-promotes-acupuncture/ |access-date=12 January 2019}}</ref>  Differences also exist regarding the extent to which it is feasible to incorporate individual-level information in decisions. Thus, evidence-based guidelines and policies may not readily "hybridise" with experience-based practices orientated towards ethical clinical judgement, and can lead to contradictions, contest, and unintended crises.<ref name=eddy5 /> The most effective "knowledge leaders" (managers and clinical leaders) use a broad range of management knowledge in their decision making, rather than just formal evidence.<ref name=feinstein2 /> Evidence-based guidelines may provide the basis for [[governmentality]] in health care, and consequently play a central role in the governance of contemporary health care systems.<ref name=sackett />

== Methods ==

=== Steps ===
The steps for designing explicit, evidence-based guidelines were described in the late 1980s: formulate the question (population, intervention, comparison intervention, outcomes, time horizon, setting); search the literature to identify studies that inform the question; interpret each study to determine precisely what it says about the question; if several studies address the question, synthesize their results ([[meta-analysis]]); summarize the evidence in evidence tables; compare the benefits, harms and costs in a balance sheet; draw a conclusion about the preferred practice; write the guideline; write the rationale for the guideline; have others review each of the previous steps; implement the guideline.<ref name=eddy4 />

For the purposes of medical education and individual-level decision making, five steps of EBM in practice were described in 1992<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Cook DJ, Jaeschke R, Guyatt GH | title = Critical appraisal of therapeutic interventions in the intensive care unit: human monoclonal antibody treatment in sepsis.

=== Evidence reviews ===
[[Systematic review]]s of published research studies are a major part of the evaluation of particular treatments. The [[Cochrane Collaboration]] is one of the best-known organisations that conducts systematic reviews. Like other producers of systematic reviews, it requires authors to provide a detailed study protocol as well as a reproducible plan of their literature search and evaluations of the evidence.<ref name="Tanjong2009">{{cite journal | vauthors = Tanjong-Ghogomu E, Tugwell P, Welch V | title = Evidence-based medicine and the Cochrane Collaboration | journal = Bulletin of the NYU Hospital for Joint Diseases | volume = 67 | issue = 2 | pages = 198–205 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19583554 | url = http://www.nyuhjdbulletin.org/Permalink.aspx?permalinkId=07a150ec-2275-4bbf-9003-6ea200b62a4f | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130601140339/http://www.nyuhjdbulletin.org/Permalink.aspx?permalinkId=07a150ec-2275-4bbf-9003-6ea200b62a4f | archive-date = 1 June 2013 }}</ref> After the best evidence is assessed, treatment is categorized as (1) likely to be beneficial, (2) likely to be harmful, or (3) without evidence to support either benefit or harm.

A 2007 analysis of 1,016 systematic reviews from all 50 Cochrane Collaboration Review Groups found that 44% of the reviews concluded that the intervention was likely to be beneficial, 7% concluded that the intervention was likely to be harmful, and 49% concluded that evidence did not support either benefit or harm. 96% recommended further research.<ref name="Mapping2007">{{cite journal | vauthors = El Dib RP, Atallah AN, Andriolo RB | title = Mapping the Cochrane evidence for decision making in health care | journal = Journal of Evaluation in Clinical Practice | volume = 13 | issue = 4 | pages = 689–692 | date = August 2007 | pmid = 17683315 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2753.2007.00886.x }}</ref> In 2017, a study assessed the role of systematic reviews produced by Cochrane Collaboration to inform US private payers' policymaking; it showed that although the medical policy documents of major US private payers were informed by Cochrane systematic reviews, there was still scope to encourage the further use.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Singh A, Hussain S, Najmi AK | title = Role of Cochrane Reviews in informing US private payers' policies | journal = Journal of Evidence-Based Medicine | volume = 10 | issue = 4 | pages = 293–331 | date = November 2017 | pmid = 29193899 | doi = 10.1111/jebm.12278 | s2cid = 22796658 }}</ref>

=== Assessing the quality of evidence ===
{{Main|Levels of evidence}}
Evidence-based medicine categorizes different types of clinical evidence and rates or grades them<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.essentialevidenceplus.com/product/ebm_loe.cfm?show=grade |title=EBM: Levels of Evidence |publisher=Essential Evidence Plus |access-date=23 February 2012}}</ref> according to the strength of their freedom from the various biases that beset medical research. For example, the strongest evidence for therapeutic interventions is provided by systematic review of [[randomized]], well-blinded, [[placebo-controlled trials]] with allocation concealment and complete follow-up involving a homogeneous patient population and medical condition. In contrast, patient testimonials, [[case report]]s, and even expert opinion have little value as proof because of the placebo effect, the biases inherent in observation and reporting of cases, and difficulties in ascertaining who is an expert  (however, some critics have argued that expert opinion "does not belong in the rankings of the quality of [[empirical evidence]] because it does not represent a form of empirical evidence" and continue that "expert opinion would seem to be a separate, complex type of knowledge that would not fit into hierarchies otherwise limited to empirical evidence alone.").<ref name="Tonelli99">{{cite journal | vauthors = Tonelli MR | title = In defense of expert opinion | journal = Academic Medicine | volume = 74 | issue = 11 | pages = 1187–1192 | date = November 1999 | pmid = 10587679 | doi = 10.1097/00001888-199911000-00010 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

Several organizations have developed grading systems for assessing the quality of evidence. For example, in 1989 the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) put forth the following system:<ref name="USPrevServTaskForce">{{cite book|author=U.S. Preventive Services Task Force|title=Guide to clinical preventive services: report of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eQGJHgI_dR8C&pg=PR24 |date=August 1989|publisher=DIANE Publishing|isbn=978-1-56806-297-6|pages=24–}}</ref>
* Level I: Evidence obtained from at least one properly designed [[randomized controlled trial]].
* Level II-1: Evidence obtained from well-designed controlled trials without [[randomization]].
* Level II-2: Evidence obtained from well-designed [[Cohort study|cohort studies]] or [[case-control]] studies, preferably from more than one center or research group.
* Level II-3: Evidence obtained from multiple [[time series]] designs with or without the intervention. Dramatic results in uncontrolled trials might also be regarded as this type of evidence.
* Level III: Opinions of respected authorities, based on clinical experience, descriptive studies, or reports of expert committees.

Another example are the Oxford CEBM Levels of Evidence published by the [[Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine]]. First released in September 2000, the Levels of Evidence provide a way to rank evidence for claims about prognosis, diagnosis, treatment benefits, treatment harms, and screening, which most grading schemes do not address. The original CEBM Levels were Evidence-Based On Call to make the process of finding evidence feasible and its results explicit. In 2011, an international team redesigned the Oxford CEBM Levels to make them more understandable and to take into account recent developments in evidence ranking schemes. The Oxford CEBM Levels of Evidence have been used by patients and clinicians, as well as by experts to develop clinical guidelines, such as recommendations for the optimal use of phototherapy and topical therapy in [[psoriasis]]<ref>{{cite web | author = OCEBM Levels of Evidence Working Group |title=The Oxford Levels of Evidence 2' |url=http://www.cebm.net/index.aspx?o=5653 |date=May 2016 |access-date=9 December 2013 |archive-date=5 December 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131205135701/http://www.cebm.net/index.aspx?o=5653 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and guidelines for the use of the BCLC staging system for diagnosing and monitoring [[hepatocellular carcinoma]] in Canada.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Paul C, Gallini A, Archier E, Castela E, Devaux S, Aractingi S, Aubin F, Bachelez H, Cribier B, Joly P, Jullien D, Le Maître M, Misery L, Richard MA, Ortonne JP | display-authors = 6 | title = Evidence-based recommendations on topical treatment and phototherapy of psoriasis: systematic review and expert opinion of a panel of dermatologists | journal = Journal of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology | volume = 26 | issue = Suppl 3 | pages = 1–10 | date = May 2012 | pmid = 22512675 | doi = 10.1111/j.1468-3083.2012.04518.x | s2cid = 36103291 }}</ref>

In 2000, a system was developed by the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation ([[GRADE]]) working group. The GRADE system takes into account more dimensions than just the quality of medical research.<ref name="GRADE">{{cite web|url=http://www.gradeworkinggroup.org/|title=Welcome to the GRADE working group|access-date=24 September 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060207191324/http://www.gradeworkinggroup.org/|archive-date=7 February 2006|url-status=live|website=www.gradeworkinggroup.org}}</ref> It requires users who are performing an assessment of the quality of evidence, usually as part of a systematic review, to consider the impact of different factors on their confidence in the results. Authors of GRADE tables assign one of four levels to evaluate the quality of evidence, on the basis of their confidence that the observed effect (a numeric value) is close to the true effect. The confidence value is based on judgments assigned in five different domains in a structured manner.<ref name="balshem2011">{{cite journal | vauthors = Balshem H, Helfand M, Schünemann HJ, Oxman AD, Kunz R, Brozek J, Vist GE, Falck-Ytter Y, Meerpohl J, Norris S, Guyatt GH | display-authors = 6 | title = GRADE guidelines: 3.

Systematic reviews may include randomized controlled trials that have low risk of bias, or observational studies that have high risk of bias. In the case of randomized controlled trials, the quality of evidence is high but can be downgraded in five different domains.<ref name="GRADE Handbook">{{cite book|title=GRADE handbook for grading quality of evidence and strength of recommendation|year=2009|edition=Version 3.2|editor3-link=Holger Jens Schünemann|veditors=Schünemann H, Brożek J, Oxman A}}<br />{{cite web|title=GRADEPro|website=Cochrane Informatics and Knowledge Management Department|url=http://tech.cochrane.org/gradepro|access-date=1 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305115426/http://tech.cochrane.org/gradepro|archive-date=5 March 2016|url-status=dead}}<br />{{cite book|title=GRADE handbook for grading quality of evidence and strength of recommendations.

* Risk of bias: A judgment made on the basis of the chance that bias in included studies has influenced the estimate of effect.
* Imprecision: A judgment made on the basis of the chance that the observed estimate of effect could change completely.
* Indirectness: A judgment made on the basis of the differences in characteristics of how the study was conducted and how the results are actually going to be applied.
* Inconsistency: A judgment made on the basis of the variability of results across the included studies.
* Publication bias: A judgment made on the basis of the question whether all the research evidence has been taken to account.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=DeVito |first=Nicholas J. |last2=Goldacre |first2=Ben |date=April 2019 |title=Catalogue of bias: publication bias |url=https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30523135 |journal=BMJ evidence-based medicine |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=53–54 |doi=10.1136/bmjebm-2018-111107 |issn=2515-4478 |pmid=30523135}}</ref>

In the case of observational studies per GRADE, the quality of evidence starts off lower and may be upgraded in three domains in addition to being subject to downgrading.<ref name="GRADE Handbook" />
* Large effect: Methodologically strong studies show that the observed effect is so large that the probability of it changing completely is less likely.
* Plausible confounding would change the effect: Despite the presence of a possible confounding factor that is expected to reduce the observed effect, the effect estimate still shows significant effect.
* Dose response gradient: The intervention used becomes more effective with increasing dose. This suggests that a further increase will likely bring about more effect.

Meaning of the levels of quality of evidence as per GRADE:<ref name="balshem2011" />
* High Quality Evidence: The authors are very confident that the presented estimate lies very close to the true value. In other words, the probability is very low that further research will completely change the presented conclusions.
* Moderate Quality Evidence: The authors are confident that the presented estimate lies close to the true value, but it is also possible that it may be substantially different. In other words, further research may completely change the conclusions.
* Low Quality Evidence: The authors are not confident in the effect estimate, and the true value may be substantially different. In other words, further research is likely to change the presented conclusions completely.
* Very Low Quality Evidence: The authors do not have any confidence in the estimate and it is likely that the true value is substantially different from it. In other words, new research will probably change the presented conclusions completely.

=== Categories of recommendations ===
In guidelines and other publications, recommendation for a clinical service is classified by the balance of risk versus benefit and the level of evidence on which this information is based. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force uses the following system:<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Sherman M, Burak K, Maroun J, Metrakos P, Knox JJ, Myers RP, Guindi M, Porter G, Kachura JR, Rasuli P, Gill S, Ghali P, Chaudhury P, Siddiqui J, Valenti D, Weiss A, Wong R | display-authors = 6 | title = Multidisciplinary Canadian consensus recommendations for the management and treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma | journal = Current Oncology | volume = 18 | issue = 5 | pages = 228–240 | date = October 2011 | pmid = 21980250 | pmc = 3185900 | doi = 10.3747/co.v18i5.952 }}</ref>
* Level A: Good [[scientific evidence]] suggests that the benefits of the clinical service substantially outweigh the potential risks. Clinicians should discuss the service with eligible patients.
* Level B: At least fair scientific evidence suggests that the benefits of the clinical service outweighs the potential risks. Clinicians should discuss the service with eligible patients.
* Level C: At least fair scientific evidence suggests that the clinical service provides benefits, but the balance between benefits and risks is too close for general recommendations. Clinicians need not offer it unless individual considerations apply.
* Level D: At least fair scientific evidence suggests that the risks of the clinical service outweigh potential benefits. Clinicians should not routinely offer the service to asymptomatic patients.
* Level I: [[Scientific evidence]] is lacking, of poor quality, or conflicting, such that the risk versus benefit balance cannot be assessed. Clinicians should help patients understand the uncertainty surrounding the clinical service.

GRADE guideline panelists may make strong or weak recommendations on the basis of further criteria. Some of the important criteria are the balance between desirable and undesirable effects (not considering cost), the quality of the evidence, values and preferences and costs (resource utilization).<ref name="GRADE Handbook" />

Despite the differences between systems, the purposes are the same: to guide users of clinical research information on which studies are likely to be most valid. However, the individual studies still require careful critical appraisal.{{cn|date=August 2022}}

=== Statistical measures ===
Evidence-based medicine attempts to express clinical benefits of tests and treatments using mathematical methods. Tools used by practitioners of evidence-based medicine include:
* Likelihood ratio {{Main|Likelihood ratios in diagnostic testing}} The [[pre-test odds]] of a particular diagnosis, multiplied by the likelihood ratio, determines the [[pre- and post-test probability|post-test odds]]. (Odds can be calculated from, and then converted to, the [more familiar] probability.) This reflects [[Bayes' theorem]]. The differences in likelihood ratio between clinical tests can be used to prioritize clinical tests according to their usefulness in a given clinical situation.
* AUC-ROC The area under the [[receiver operating characteristic]] curve (AUC-ROC) reflects the relationship between [[sensitivity and specificity]] for a given test. High-quality tests will have an AUC-ROC approaching 1, and high-quality publications about clinical tests will provide information about the AUC-ROC. Cutoff values for positive and negative tests can influence specificity and sensitivity, but they do not affect AUC-ROC.
* [[Number needed to treat]] (NNT)/[[Number needed to harm]] (NNH). NNT and NNH are ways of expressing the effectiveness and safety, respectively, of interventions in a way that is clinically meaningful. NNT is the number of people who need to be treated in order to achieve the desired outcome (e.g. survival from cancer) in one patient. For example, if a treatment increases the chance of survival by 5%, then 20 people need to be treated in order for 1 additional patient to survive because of the treatment. The concept can also be applied to diagnostic tests. For example, if 1,339 women age 50–59 need to be invited for breast cancer screening over a ten-year period in order to prevent one woman from dying of breast cancer,<ref name="BandolierStatins2004">"Patient Compliance with statins" ''[[Bandolier (journal)|Bandolier]]'' [http://www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/bandolier/booth/cardiac/patcomp.html Review]2004 {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20150512021122/http://www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/bandolier/booth/cardiac/patcomp.html |date=12 May 2015 }}</ref> then the NNT for being invited to breast cancer screening is 1339.

=== Quality of clinical trials ===
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2017}}
Evidence-based medicine attempts to objectively evaluate the quality of clinical research by critically assessing techniques reported by researchers in their publications.

A 2018 study, "Why all randomised controlled trials produce biased results", assessed the 10 most cited RCTs and argued that trials face a wide range of biases and constraints, from trials only being able to study a small set of questions amenable to randomisation and generally only being able to assess the ''average'' treatment effect of a sample, to limitations in extrapolating results to another context, among many others outlined in the study.<ref name="Krauss, Alexander. 2018" />

== Application of evidence in clinical settings ==
Despite the emphasis on evidence-based medicine, unsafe or ineffective medical practices continue to be applied, because of patient demand for tests or treatments, because of failure to access information about the evidence, or because of the rapid pace of change in the scientific evidence.<ref name="Epstein">{{Cite news|url=https://www.propublica.org/article/when-evidence-says-no-but-doctors-say-yes|title=When Evidence Says No, But Doctors Say Yes| vauthors = Epstein D |date=22 February 2017|publisher=ProPublica|access-date=24 February 2017}}</ref>  For example, between 2003 and 2017, the evidence shifted on hundreds of medical practices, including whether [[hormone replacement therapy]] was safe, whether babies should be given certain vitamins, and whether [[antidepressant drugs]] are effective in people with [[Alzheimer's disease]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Herrera-Perez D, Haslam A, Crain T, Gill J, Livingston C, Kaestner V, Hayes M, Morgan D, Cifu AS, Prasad V | display-authors = 6 | title = A comprehensive review of randomized clinical trials in three medical journals reveals 396 medical reversals | journal = eLife | volume = 8 | page = e45183 | date = June 2019 | pmid = 31182188 | pmc = 6559784 | doi = 10.7554/eLife.45183 | doi-access = free }}</ref> Even when the evidence unequivocally shows that a treatment is either not safe or not effective, it may take many years for other treatments to be adopted.<ref name="Epstein" />

Physicians may also reject evidence that conflicts with their anecdotal experience or because of cognitive biases – for example, a vivid memory of a rare but shocking outcome (the [[availability heuristic]]), such as a patient dying after refusing treatment.<ref name="Epstein" /> They may overtreat to "do something" or to address a patient's emotional needs.<ref name="Epstein" /> They may worry about malpractice charges based on a discrepancy between what the patient expects and what the evidence recommends.<ref name="Epstein" /> They may also overtreat or provide ineffective treatments because the treatment feels biologically plausible.<ref name="Epstein" />

A Campbell systematic review that included 24 trials examined the effectiveness of e-learning in improving evidence-based health care knowledge and practice. It was found that e-learning, compared to no learning, improves evidence-based health care knowledge and skills but not attitudes and behaviour. No difference in outcomes is present when comparing e-learning with face-to-face learning.
