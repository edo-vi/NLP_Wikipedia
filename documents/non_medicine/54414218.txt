'''Absyrtus''' ({{lang-grc|Ἄψυρτος}}) was an Ancient Greek [[veterinary surgeon]].

== History ==
Absyrtus was one of the principal veterinary surgeons of whom any remains are still extant. According to the [[Suda]] and [[Eudokia Makrembolitissa]], he was born either at [[Bursa#History|Prusa]] or [[Nicomedia]] in [[Bithynia]] (modern-day [[Turkey]]).<ref>''[[Suda]]'', "Ἄψυρτος"</ref><ref>[[Eudokia Makrembolitissa]], ''[[Eudokia Makrembolitissa#Writings|Collection]]''</ref><ref>''Violar. ap.'' Villoison, ''Anecd. Graeca'', vol. i. p. 65</ref> He is said to have served under "Constantine" in his campaign on the [[Danube]], which is generally supposed to mean [[Constantine the Great]], in 322 CE, but some refer it to that under [[Constantine IV]] in 671 CE.

His writings are to be found in the ''Veterinariae Medicinae Libri Duo'', first published in Latin by [[Jean Ruel]],<ref>[[Jean Ruel]], ''Veterinariae Medicinae Libri Duo'', Paris, 1530, fol.</ref> and afterwards in Greek by [[Simon Grynaeus]].<ref>Simon Grynaeus, Basil. 1537, 4to.</ref> [[Christian Konrad Sprengel]] published a little work titled ''Programma de Apsyrto Bithynio''.<ref>[[Christian Konrad Sprengel]], ''Programma de Apsyrto Bithynio'', Halae, 1832, 4to.</ref>
