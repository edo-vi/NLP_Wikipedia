'''Poetics''' is the theory of structure, form, and [[discourse]] within [[literature]],<ref>[[Gérard Genette]] (2005), [https://books.google.com/books?id=CWjjasIjWiYC&pg=PA14 ''Essays In Aesthetics, Volume 4''], p.14: {{quotation|My program then was named "Theory of Literary Forms" — a title that I supposed to be less ambiguous for minds a little distant from this specialty, if it is one, than its (for me) synonym Poetics.}}</ref> and, in particular, within [[poetry]].<ref>{{Cite Dictionary.com|poetics}}</ref>

==History==
The term ''poetics'' derives from the [[Ancient Greek]] ποιητικός ''poietikos'' "pertaining to poetry"; also "creative" and "productive".<ref>[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=poetic "poetic"]. ''[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]''.</ref> In the Western world, the development and evolution of poetics featured three artistic movements concerned with poetical composition: (i) the [[Formalism (literature)|formalist]], (2) the [[Metaphysical objectivism|objectivist]], and (iii) the [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]]. (see the ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'').<ref name="Brogan">{{cite book | last = Brogan | first = T. | title = The New Princeton Handbook of Poetic Terms | publisher = Princeton University Press | location = Princeton | year = 1994 | isbn = 978-0-691-03672-4 }}</ref> Aristotle's ''Poetics'' is the first extant philosophical treatise to focus on literary theory. [[File:Poetique Aristote Arabe 2346.jpg|thumb|Arabic translation of Aristotle's Poetics by [[Abu Bishr Matta ibn Yunus]]]] The work was lost to the Western world for a long time. It was available in the [[Middle Ages]] and early Renaissance only through a Latin translation of an [[Arabic]] commentary written by [[Averroes]] and translated by [[Hermannus Alemannus]] in 1256. The accurate [[Ancient Greek|Greek]]-[[Latin]] translation made by [[William of Moerbeke]] in 1278 was virtually ignored. The Arabic translation departed widely in vocabulary from the original ''Poetics'' and it initiated a misinterpretation of Aristotelian thought that continued through the Middle Ages. Modern poetics developed in [[Italian Renaissance|Renaissance Italy]]. The need to interpret ancient literary texts in the light of [[Christianity]], to appraise and assess the narratives of [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]], [[Petrarch]], and [[Giovanni Boccaccio|Boccaccio]], contributed to the development of complex discourses on [[literary theory]]. Thanks first of all to Giovanni Boccaccio's ''[[Genealogia Deorum Gentilium]]'' (1360), the literate elite gained a rich understanding of [[Metaphor|metaphorical]] and figurative [[Trope (literature)|tropes]]. [[Giorgio Valla]]'s 1498 Latin translation of Aristotle's text (the first to be published) was included with the 1508 [[Aldine Press|Aldine]] printing of the Greek original as part of an [[anthology]] of ''Rhetores graeci''. There followed an ever-expanding corpus of texts on poetics in the later fifteenth century and throughout the sixteenth, a phenomenon that began in [[Italy]] and spread to [[Spain]], [[England]], and [[France]]. Among the most important Renaissance works on poetics are [[Marco Girolamo Vida]]'s ''De arte poetica'' (1527) and [[Gian Giorgio Trissino]]'s ''La Poetica'' (1529, expanded edition 1563). By the early decades of the sixteenth century, vernacular versions of Aristotle's ''Poetics'' appeared, culminating in [[Lodovico Castelvetro]]'s Italian editions of 1570 and 1576. [[Luis de Góngora]] (1561–1627) and [[Baltasar Gracián]] (1601–58) brought a different kind of sophistication to poetic. [[Emanuele Tesauro]] wrote extensively in his ''Il Cannocchiale Aristotelico'' (The Aristotelian Spyglass, 1654), on ''figure ingeniose'' and ''figure metaforiche''.<ref>Benassi, A., “Lo scherzevole inganno. Figure ingegnose e argutezza nel Cannocchiale aristotelico di Emanuele Tesauro”, ''Studi secenteschi'' 47 (2006) 9–55.</ref> During the [[Romanticism|Romantic era]], poetics tended toward [[expressionism]] and emphasized the perceiving [[subject (philosophy)|subject]]. Twentieth-century poetics returned to the Aristotelian paradigm, followed by trends toward meta-criticality, and the establishment of a contemporary theory of poetics.<ref name="Preminger2016">{{cite book |last1=Preminger |first1=Alex |title=Princeton Encyclopaedia of Poetry and Poetics |date=2016 |publisher=Macmillan International Higher Education |isbn=978-1-349-15617-7 |page=952 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ID1dDwAAQBAJ&q=metacritical&pg=PA952 |language=en}}</ref> Eastern poetics developed [[lyric poetry]], rather than the representational [[mimesis|mimetic poetry]] of the Western world.<ref name="Brogan" />

==In literary criticism==
Poetics is distinguished from [[hermeneutics]] by its focus not on the meaning of a text, but rather its understanding of how a text's different elements come together and produce certain effects on the reader.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Culler |first1=Jonathan |author-link=Jonathan Culler |year=1997 |title=Literary Theory: A Very Short Introduction}}:</ref> Most [[literary criticism]] combines poetics and hermeneutics in a single analysis; however, one or the other may predominate given the text and the aims of the one doing the reading.
