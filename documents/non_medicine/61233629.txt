The '''Veterinary Drugs Directorate''' is the [[Canada|Canadian]] body responsible for putting all "[[Veterinary medicine|veterinary]] products, such [[antimicrobials]], [[Antibiotic use in livestock#Growth stimulation|growth promotion drugs]] and [[feed additives]], through a rigorous approval process before they are licensed and sold for use" in Canada.<ref>{{cite web |title=Canada's Veterinary Drug Approval Process |url=https://www.beefresearch.ca/blog/canadas-veterinary-drug-approval-process/ |website=bcrc.ca |date=21 November 2013 |publisher=Beef Cattle Research Council}}</ref> It is part of the [[Health Products and Food Branch]] of [[Health Canada]], and exists by virtue of the ''[[Food and Drugs Act]]''. Its goal is "to protect human and animal health and the safety of Canada's food supply."<ref>{{cite web |title=Veterinary Drugs Directorate (VDD) |url=https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/corporate/about-health-canada/branches-agencies/health-products-food-branch/veterinary-drugs-directorate.html |website=canada.ca |publisher=Health Canada |date=2019-07-04}}</ref>

==History==

===AMR===
The [[WHO]] has defined ''[[Antimicrobial resistance]]'' (AMR) as "the ability of a [[microorganism]] (like [[bacteria]], [[viruses]], and some [[parasites]]) to stop an antimicrobial (such as [[antibiotics]], [[antivirals]] and [[antimalarials]]) from working against it. As a result, standard treatments become ineffective, [[infections]] persist and may spread to other [people]."<ref name="who">{{cite web |title=Antimicrobial resistance |url=https://www.who.int/antimicrobial-resistance/en/ |website=who.int |publisher=WHO}}</ref>

In 2011, [[Manisha Mehrotra]], at the time director of the human safety division within the Directorate, spoke passionately about the need to crack down on the use of antibiotics such as [[cephalosporins]] and [[fluoroquinolones]] in the Canadian meat industry because of the risk of creating [[antibiotic resistant]] strains of viruses.<ref>{{cite news |title=Crackdown on factory farm drug use urged |url=http://www.cmaj.ca/content/cmaj/early/2011/11/28/cmaj.109-4055.full.pdf |publisher=CMAJ |date=25 November 2011}}</ref>

On 1 December 2018, "all medically important antimicrobials currently available [[over the counter]] for [[veterinary]] use, including those used in companion and food animals and in all dosage forms", were moved to [[Medical prescription|prescription]] status. Antimicrobials are no longer to be used for growth promotion in Canada from this date.<ref>{{cite news |title=Health Canada encourages establishment of veterinary client relationships |url=http://www.dairyproducer.ca/health-canada-encourages-establishment-of-veterinary-client-relationships/ |agency=Farmscape |publisher=dairyproducer.ca |date=5 November 2018}}</ref>
