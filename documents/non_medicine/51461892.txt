==Plot and aftermath==
The plot involved terrorists infiltrating the Stade Vélodrome in [[Marseille]] as stadium crew, in order to attack English players and spectators during the [[England|England-]][[Tunisia]] match on 15 June.<ref name="ESPN"/> Although Osama bin Laden had a rented place in the stands of [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal Football Club]], he wanted to destroy English football.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|title=FIFA World Cup 98': Chilling details of Osama Bin Laden's terror plot targeting England football team|url=https://www.timesnownews.com/fifa-football-world-cup-2018-russia/article/fifa-world-cup-98-chilling-details-of-osama-bin-ladens-terror-plot-targeting-england-football-team/242912|access-date=2020-11-04|website=Times Now News |location=India}}</ref> Terrorists had reportedly planned to blow up the England substitute bench (targeting youngsters [[David Beckham]] and [[Michael Owen]]), shoot English players and throw grenades into the stands.<ref name="ESPN2">{{Cite news|first=Harry|last=Harris|title=England terrorist plot revealed|url=http://www.espnfc.com/story/683732/england-football-team-escaped-terrorist-attack-at-1998-world-cup|work=ESPN FC|date=8 October 2009}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|first=Laurent|last=Dubois|year=2010|title=Soccer Empire: The World Cup and the Future of France|url=https://archive.org/details/soccerempireworl0000dubo|url-access=registration|publisher=University of California Press|page=[https://archive.org/details/soccerempireworl0000dubo/page/181 181]|isbn=9780520259287}}</ref> Other terrorists were then to storm the United States national team's hotel in Paris and attack American players watching the game there.<ref name="ESPN"/> The attacks would be followed by the hijacking of an aircraft by another group of terrorists to be crashed into the [[Civaux Nuclear Power Plant]] near [[Poitiers]], causing a [[nuclear meltdown]].<ref name="ESPN"/>

The details, and even existence, of the plot were kept secret from managers, players and the media, but were known to security services including [[The Football Association]] staff.<ref name="ESPN2"/> In 2009, the England manager in 1998, [[Glenn Hoddle]], revealed that he had only been informed of the plot "years later", while the FA's Director of Communications during 1998, [[David Davies (football administrator)|David Davies]], said that he had been informed of the plot before the match by the FA's Head of Security, Brian Hayes.<ref name="ESPN2"/> The match was otherwise marred by supporter riots in Marseille, with British vehicles being bricked while bottles were thrown across the streets, causing police to use tear gas as large numbers of supporters were injured and arrested.<ref name="ESPN2"/>

Although organised by GIA operatives, the plot reportedly had the backing and support of al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.<ref>{{Cite book|editor-first1=Nicholas John|editor-last1=Cull|editor-first2=David Holbrook|editor-last2=Culbert|editor-first3=David|editor-last3=Welch|first=Nicholas J.|last=Cull|year=2003|title=Propaganda and Mass Persuasion: A Historical Encyclopedia, 1500 to the Present|chapter=Osama bin Laden|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Byzv7rf6gL8C&pg=PA222|publisher=ABC-CLIO|page=222|isbn=9781576078204}}</ref> Laden funded and assisted in the development of the murder plan, promised to provide additional financial support for implementation and weapons, and participated in the training of key GIA individuals at an al-Qaeda training camp.<ref name=":0" /> According to the bin Laden biographer, [[Yossef Bodansky]], the World Cup plot being foiled was one of the reasons for "dormant terrorist networks" responsible for the August [[1998 United States embassy bombings]] being "reactivated".<ref name="ESPN"/><ref>{{Cite news|first=Simon|last=Kuper|title=The World's Game Is Not Just A Game|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/05/26/magazine/the-world-s-game-is-not-just-a-game.html?pagewanted=all|work=The New York Times Magazine|date=26 May 2002|url-access=subscription}}</ref>

A terror plot against the [[UEFA Euro 2000]] was discovered after [[Dutch people|Dutch]] intelligence services intercepted calls made between GIA operatives from inside French prisons.<ref name="ESPN2000">{{Cite news|title= Gun guard on French soccer stars|url=http://www.espnfc.com.au/euro2000/news/20000620frathreat.html|work=ESPN Soccernet|date=20 June 2000}}</ref> Three men were detained in French prisons as a result of the plot, and three were subsequently arrested in the [[Netherlands]].<ref name="ESPN2000"/> One of the French prisoners detained for the plot was Adel Mechat, who served six years in prison after having been arrested in Germany and extradited to France as part of the 1998 World Cup raids.<ref name="ESPN"/><ref name="ESPN2000"/>

On the night before the first-ever football match between France and Algeria in October 2001, police seized explosives and arrested four Islamist militants suspected of having targeted the game after a phone call had been intercepted with warnings to stay away from the [[Stade de France]]. Other items retrieved included bulletproof vests and explosives manuals.<ref name="PBS"/><ref name="Telegraph">{{Cite news|title=International Football: Seventeen held as Algerian fans invade pitch|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/international/3014255/International-Football-Seventeen-held-as-Algerian-fans-invade-pitch.html|work=The Telegraph|date=7 October 2001}}</ref> The match itself was marred with controversy and was eventually stopped with 15 minutes playing time left after Algerian fans stormed the field.<ref name="PBS"/><ref name="Telegraph"/>
