{{Vaccination}}
'''Mass vaccination''' is a public policy effort to [[vaccination|vaccinate]] a large number of people, possibly the entire [[World population|population of the world]] or of a country or region, within a short period of time. This policy may be directed during a [[pandemic]], when there is a localized [[outbreak]] or scare of a disease for which a [[vaccine]] exists, or when a new vaccine is invented.

Under normal circumstances, vaccines are provided as part of an individual's [[medical care]] starting from birth and given as part of routine checkups. But there are times when there is a need to quickly vaccinate the population at large and provide easy access to the service. When this occurs, temporary clinics may be established around communities that can efficiently handle the many people within at once.

Challenges of a mass vaccination effort include vaccine [[Supply (economics)|supply]], [[logistics]], storage, finding [[vaccinator]]s and other necessary staff, [[vaccine safety]] and public outreach.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news | vauthors = Florio J, Shapiro O |date=2020-12-18 |title=How New York City Vaccinated 6 Million People in Less Than a Month |language=en-US |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/18/nyregion/nyc-smallpox-vaccine.html |access-date=2022-08-04 |issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

==Historic mass vaccinations==

=== Smallpox ===
==== Early successes in eradication (prior to 1950) ====
In 1947, after a man traveled from [[Mexico]] to [[New York City]] and developed [[smallpox]], Dr. [[Israel Weinstein]] announced to the residents of New York the need to get vaccinated. Vaccine clinics were established throughout the city and within less than a month, 6,350,000 residents were vaccinated.<ref name=":0" /> This was enabled by improvements in vaccine production and storage. Prior to new developments, transportation represented a major issue and hindered mass vaccinations.<ref name="Belongia_2003">{{cite journal | vauthors = Belongia EA, Naleway AL | title = Smallpox vaccine: the good, the bad, and the ugly | journal = Clinical Medicine & Research | volume = 1 | issue = 2 | pages = 87â€“92 | date = April 2003 | pmid = 15931293 | pmc = 1069029 | doi = 10.3121/cmr.1.2.87 }}</ref> Because smallpox vaccination requires a live virus, it originally required a sample to be transferred from person-to-person or animal-to-person directly.<ref name="Belongia_2003" /> The creation of a liquid vaccine stored in capillary tubes marked a major advancement for the smallpox vaccine.<ref name="Fenner_1988">{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/19521677 |title=Smallpox and its eradication |date=1988 |publisher=World Health Organization | vauthors = Fenner F |isbn=92-4-156110-6 |location=Geneva |oclc=19521677}}</ref> This method involved the use of glycerol as a preservative and was significant for storage and transportation.<ref name="Fenner_1988" /> In addition to these benefits, it enabled mass production through the use of animals, and ensured long term viability at temperatures below freezing.<ref name="Fenner_1988" /> However, this method was not sufficient enough to enable widespread vaccination in tropical regions of the world, and thus was largely restricted to temperate countries.<ref name="Fenner_1988" /> Compulsory vaccinations were used throughout the beginning of the 20th century in a most of these countries, which led to the decline of smallpox.<ref name="Fenner_1988" /> For countries such as the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and some other European countries, outbreaks were quickly shut down by strong public health policies.<ref name="Fenner_1988" /> Soon, the more deadly Variola Major smallpox variant steadily declined, and endemics were only brought on by travelers from countries that lacked control over smallpox outbreaks.<ref name="Fenner_1988" /> It's important to note that the  milder Variola Minor smallpox variant remained prevalent until the mid-20th century, as it often didn't warrant hospital visits or was misdiagnosed.<ref name="Fenner_1988" /> The success of health policies in controlling and eliminating smallpox by 1950s in many countries led some to believe that the world eradication of smallpox would be possible.<ref name="Fenner_1988" />

==== Interest in worldwide eradication (1950-1959) ====
The creation of a heat stable, freeze-dried vaccine occurred in the 1950s.<ref name="Belongia_2003" /> Further improvements in freeze-drying technology allowed for the mass production of the vaccine at a commercial level.<ref name="Fenner_1988" /> The Health Assembly, a group within the [[World Health Organization|World Health organization (WHO)]], began discussing the possibility of eliminating smallpox between 1950 and 1955.<ref name="Fenner_1988" /> The idea was ultimately rejected, as many viewed it an impossible task to take on. In 1958, a professor from the USSR, acting as a Health Assembly delegate, once again pushed the idea of smallpox being an issue for all countries, whether or not endemics are still occurring.<ref name="Fenner_1988" /> He presented a report to the Eleventh [[World Health Assembly]], which argued that world eradication of the disease is possible, as shown by the success of countries that managed to eliminate it through health policy.<ref name="Fenner_1988" /> This was particularly significant as the professor, [[Viktor Zhdanov]], had come to the conclusion on his own, without knowledge of arguments from previous World Health Assemblies. In this Zhdanov Report, he used the USSR as an example, arguing that the success of mandatory vaccinations throughout his country proves that it's possible to eliminate it in any country.<ref name="Fenner_1988" /> Zhdanov offered the support of the USSR, and backed the legitimacy of the report through the donation of millions of vaccines and previous offers of support to central-Asian countries.<ref name="Fenner_1988" /> The method of eradication would that was proposed involved the use of the newly developed freeze-dried vaccinations and mandatory vaccination.<ref name="Fenner_1988" /> Surveillance containment programs was also mentioned, which actually came to dominate in the later years of the eradication campaign.<ref name="Fenner_1988" /> Over the course of the next year, resolutions coordinating the start of the program, as well as to ensure the success of it, were made.<ref name="Fenner_1988" /> During the Twelve World Health Assembly in 1959, the proposal of an eradication campaign for smallpox was voted for successfully.<ref name="Fenner_1988" />

==== Smallpox eradication program (1960-1966) ====
The eradication of smallpox seemed to be easier and less costly than other previously eradicated diseases.<ref name="Fenner_1988" /> Smallpox had no [[Disease vector|vectors]], as humans were the only [[Natural reservoir|reservoirs]] carrying the disease. Furthermore, the elimination of the disease would be mostly on mass vaccination and did not require vector control.<ref name="Fenner_1988" /> Directed by [[Donald Henderson]], this first effort involved the use of mass vaccinations with a goal to have 80% of every country's population immunized.<ref name="Belongia_2003" /> Although the program was brought forth by WHO, implementation would largely depend on individual governments. WHO would be responsible for supporting the programs through vaccine production, and training of staff.<ref name="Fenner_1988" /> Each country would be required to cover most of the costs and actual functions of the program. A lack of universal commitment from countries hindered this campaign allowing smallpox to remain prevalent almost a decade later.<ref name="CDC_Smallpox_History">{{Cite web |date=2021-02-21 |title=History of Smallpox {{!}} Smallpox {{!}} CDC |url=https://www.cdc.gov/smallpox/history/history.html |access-date=2022-07-25 |website=www.cdc.gov |language=en-us}}</ref> This was particularly a problem in developing countries.<ref name="Belongia_2003" /> The WHO was not designed to provide considerable material support and close collaboration between countries on a wide scale.<ref name="Fenner_1988" /> Over the first few years of the program's initiation, a lack of donations of vaccines and money hindered the success of the program.<ref name="Fenner_1988" /> The WHO created the Expert Committee on Smallpox in 1964 due to the lack of progress. A report was released giving a more clear strategy to be implemented, in the form of different phases.<ref name="Fenner_1988" /> Based on outbreaks that occurred in India in regions that claimed to have more than 80% vaccination rates, the committee determined that 100% of the population would need to be vaccinated in the first mass vaccination phase. After this, they would focus on stopping subsequent cases and investigating them.<ref name="Fenner_1988" /> This was not well received during the Seventeenth World Health Assembly, in which many express doubts over the success especially with extreme vaccine shortages following a lack of donations.<ref name="Fenner_1988" /> It wasn't until 1965 that the USA increased commitment to the cause, yet not out of interest but because they were already starting a measles eradication campaign and felt this could be added on.<ref name="Fenner_1988" /> This along with continued support from the USSR led the WHO to develop an intensified program for smallpox eradication, however many members still lacked confidence in this new programs success.<ref name="Fenner_1988" />

==== Intensified smallpox eradication program (1967-1980) ====
From 1967, the Intensified Smallpox Program now called for surveillance reporting and investigation in addition to mass vaccination.<ref name="Fenner_1988" /> Teams were directed to find alternative or unique solutions in their regions.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Bhattacharya S | title = The World Health Organization and global smallpox eradication | journal = Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health | volume = 62 | issue = 10 | pages = 909â€“912 | date = October 2008 | pmid = 18791049 | doi = 10.1136/jech.2006.055590 | pmc = 2602749 }}</ref> In the years following the initiation of this plan, the WHO saw an increase in qualified volunteers, contributions from countries and participation in their campaign.<ref name="Fenner_1988" /> They worked on increasing training of staff and publicizing the program worldwide. Improvements in procedures and technology had a significant effect on advancing the program.<ref name="Fenner_1988" /> Particularly, the invention of the [[bifurcated needle]] made administration of vaccines in the field more practical than the previously used [[Jet injector|jet-injectors]].<ref name="Fenner_1988" /> The number of outbreaks, instead of the percent of population vaccinated, became the new focus.<ref name="Fenner_1988" /> By 1973, smallpox only remained a problem in five countries. Improved methods of surveillance and containment, as well as a large increase in support, was a critical part of finally eradicating smallpox.<ref name="Fenner_1988" /> The regions would contain the spread out smallpox through vaccinating anyone exposed to an infected person; this was the method of ring vaccination.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Disease Eradication |url=https://cpp-hov.netlify.app//vaccines-101/what-do-vaccines-do/disease-eradication |access-date=2022-08-01 |website=cpp-hov.netlify.app |language=en}}</ref> It would not be until May 8, 1980, during the World Health Assembly that smallpox was announced as officially eradicated.<ref name="Strassburg_1982">{{cite journal | vauthors = Strassburg MA | title = The global eradication of smallpox | language = English | journal = American Journal of Infection Control | volume = 10 | issue = 2 | pages = 53â€“59 | date = May 1982 | pmid = 7044193 | doi = 10.1016/0196-6553(82)90003-7 }}</ref>

==== Criticism of mass vaccination ====
Vaccination policies were not met without resistance, as countries that had mandatory vaccination policies saw a rise in antivaccination movements.<ref name="Fenner_1988" /> In Brazil, compulsory vaccination was met with riots.<ref name="Fenner_1988" /> The lack of control led to large outbreaks and many deaths.<ref name="Fenner_1988" /> Other countries had more success in vaccination, which led to Variola Minor replacing Variola Major as the cause of smallpox outbreaks in these countries.<ref name="Fenner_1988" /> Antivaccinationists rejected vaccination policy more, as this more mild form was not seen as significant.<ref name="Fenner_1988" /> This was particularly an issue in the United States as only some states had compulsory vaccination, while others banned or lacked laws for it.<ref name="Fenner_1988" />

===Polio===
[[File:Oral Polio Vaccine.jpg|thumb|360x360px|A young Indian girl receiving a dose of oral polio vaccine by a trained healthcare worker.]]

==== Polio campaigns in America ====
Several famous Americans helped pave the way for the acceptance of the polio vaccine in the [[United States]]. [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], one of the most famous polio patients in the world, created the [[National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis]] in 1938 which eventually became known as [[March of Dimes]].<ref name="marchofdimes">{{Cite web |title=A history of the March of Dimes |url=https://www.marchofdimes.org/mission/a-history-of-the-march-of-dimes.aspx |access-date=2022-07-26 |website=www.marchofdimes.org |language=english}}</ref> The March of Dimes funded a large portion of the polio research all throughout the epidemic and eventually resulted in the development of the vaccine by [[Jonas Salk]].<ref name="marchofdimes" /> Following the years after its invention and distribution, polio cases decreased from tens of thousands to only a handful per year.<ref name="marchofdimes" /> With the help of [[Elvis Presley]], who took the vaccine publicly, the acceptance of the polio vaccine increased even further.<ref>{{Cite web | vauthors = Sick C |date=2020-12-15 |title=Polio vs. COVID-19, the history of mass vaccination campaigns |url=https://dayton247now.com/news/coronavirus/polio-vs-covid-19-the-history-of-mass-vaccination-campaigns |access-date=2022-08-04 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20210627205313/https://dayton247now.com/news/coronavirus/polio-vs-covid-19-the-history-of-mass-vaccination-campaigns | archive-date = 27 June 2021 |website=WRGT |language=en}}</ref> This act embodied three of the most important pillars of a behavioral change campaign: social influence, social norms and examples.<ref name="Hershfield_2021">{{Cite web | vauthors = Hershfield H, Brody I |date=2021 |title=How Elvis Got Americans to Accept the Polio Vaccine |url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-elvis-got-americans-to-accept-the-polio-vaccine/ |access-date=2022-07-26 |website=Scientific American |language=en}}</ref> Elvis Presley used his social influence to normalize getting the polio vaccine, which increased vaccination rates among American youth to over 80% in just under 6 months.<ref name="Hershfield_2021" /> These types campaigns were the heart of the mass vaccination efforts in America.<ref name="Hershfield_2021" />

===Swine flu vaccination===
In 1918, the deadly [[Influenza A virus subtype H1N1|H1N1]] influenza virus which infected approximately 500 million people around the world and resulted in the deaths of 50 to 100 million people (3% to 5% of the world population).<ref>{{cite book |title=StatPearls |vauthors=Jilani TN, Jamil RT, Siddiqui AH |date=2022 |publisher=StatPearls Publishing |place=Treasure Island (FL) |chapter=H1N1 Influenza |pmid=30020613 |access-date=2022-07-26 |chapter-url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK513241/}}</ref> New York City had created two major mass immunization programs, the first was the smallpox immunization program initiated in 1947 and the second was the swine flu influenza program in 1976.<ref name="Minor_2014" />

[[Pharmacist]] have also played an important role in getting mass populations vaccinated since they are a skilled and trained workforce able to help increase vaccination rates.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Lee L, Peterson GM, Naunton M, Jackson S, Bushell M | title = Protecting the Herd: Why Pharmacists Matter in Mass Vaccination | journal = Pharmacy | volume = 8 | issue = 4 | pages = E199 | date = October 2020 | pmid = 33114654 | pmc = 7712642 | doi = 10.3390/pharmacy8040199 | doi-access = free }}</ref> Many people can turn to drug or convivence stores to get vaccinated since it can be a quick and easy place to access.<ref name="Noguchi_2021" /> Pharmacies have played a large roll in mass vaccination now more than ever due to the pandemic.<ref name="Noguchi_2021" /> Some states prior to the pandemic did not allow pharmacist to vaccinate or administer flu vaccines.<ref name="Noguchi_2021" /> Now, pharmacies are contracting with state and federal governments since they have become key players in vaccinations.<ref name="Noguchi_2021">{{Cite news | vauthors = Noguchi Y | date = January 22, 2021 |title=Mass Vaccination Efforts Thrust Pharmacies To Center Of COVID-19 Fight |language=en |work=NPR |url=https://www.npr.org/2021/01/22/959700130/mass-vaccination-efforts-thrust-pharmacies-to-center-of-covid-19-fight |access-date=2022-07-28}}</ref> Without the involvement of pharmacies mass vaccination would be difficult to achieve.<ref name="Noguchi_2021" /> in most communities 90% of people live within five miles of a pharmacy.<ref name="Noguchi_2021" /> Pharmacist can oftentimes be the quickest access to a healthcare provider, making it a desirable option for the public to come and get vaccinated.<ref name="Noguchi_2021" />

Not only have pharmacist been involved in COVID-19 vaccinations but [[pharmacy technician]]s as well.<ref name="DeMarco_2022" /> Pharmacy technicians have helped alleviate the workload on pharmacist with the large increase in demand for vaccinations.<ref name="DeMarco_2022" /> They also can create more opportunities to interact with people who are hesitant in getting the COVID-19 vaccines.<ref name="DeMarco_2022">{{cite journal | vauthors = DeMarco M, Carter C, Houle SK, Waite NM | title = The role of pharmacy technicians in vaccination services: a scoping review | journal = Journal of the American Pharmacists Association | volume = 62 | issue = 1 | pages = 15â€“26.e11 | date = 2022-01-01 | pmid = 34663566 | doi = 10.1016/j.japh.2021.09.016 | s2cid = 239027949 | doi-access = free }}</ref> Pharmacy technicians can support pharmacist which will allow more vaccination services to be accommodated efficiently and safety.<ref name="DeMarco_2022" /> These efforts will allow for an increase in vaccinations and help vaccinate large groups at a time.<ref name="DeMarco_2022" />

During the pandemic pharmacist have had a fundamental roll in sharing information about COVID-19 vaccines.<ref name="Terrie_2021" /> Pharmacist are a quick resource for information and can help relieve some common concerns about reactions or misinformation to the vaccines.<ref name="Terrie_2021">{{Cite journal | vauthors = Terrie YC |title=The Role of the Pharmacist in Overcoming Vaccine Hesitancy | journal = US Pharm | date = 2021 | volume = 45 | issue = 4 | pages = 28â€“31 |url=https://www.uspharmacist.com/article/the-role-of-the-pharmacist-in-overcoming-vaccine-hesitancy |access-date=2022-07-28 |language=en}}</ref> They are also advocates for getting vaccinated since they are educators and vaccine administrators.<ref name="Terrie_2021" /> Sharing information to the public about COVID-19 vaccines can help increase vaccinations rates.<ref name="Terrie_2021" /> Since pharmacist are easily accessible in the community setting they can help motivate or encourage getting vaccinated helping decrease preventable infections or diseases such as COVID-19.<ref name="Terrie_2021" />

Mass vaccination of COVID-19 vaccines is important to help stop the spread of the coronavirus and eventually end the pandemic.<ref name="CRF_2022" /> Individual governments have been allocating billions of dollars to increase production of vaccines to help with the current global manufacturing need of vaccines.<ref name="CRF_2022">{{Cite web |title=A Guide to Global COVID-19 Vaccine Efforts |url=https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/guide-global-covid-19-vaccine-efforts |access-date=2022-07-29 |website=Council on Foreign Relations |language=en}}</ref> Countries such as the [[United States]], [[Canada]], and [[Australia]] were able to receive many vaccines early on due to them being wealthier countries.<ref name="CRF_2022" /> They were able to receive many doses enough to vaccinate their own countries but this left other lower-income countries with limited supply of the vaccines.<ref name="CRF_2022" /> With some countries receiving more vaccines than others this leads to inequitable distribution and can increase the risk of new outbreaks.<ref name="CRF_2022" /> Without proper global vaccine distribution it will make it more difficult to end the pandemic and allow for mass vaccination as a global effort.<ref name="CRF_2022" /> Amid the new strains of the coronavirus such as the [[SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant|omicron variant]], scientist and healthcare officials have raised concern about reduced effectiveness of available vaccines.<ref name="CRF_2022" /> In response to a concern about vaccines having reduced effectiveness countries have encouraged booster shots for most of their population.<ref name="CRF_2022" /> The World Health Organization would like to prioritize unvaccinated people over booster doses so more of the population will have received their initial dose.<ref name="CRF_2022" />
