'''Synchysis scintillans''' is a degenerative condition of the [[eye]] resulting in liquefied [[vitreous humor]] and the accumulation of [[cholesterol]] crystals within the vitreous.  It is also known as '''cholesterolosis bulbi'''.  The vitreous liquifies in a process known as [[syneresis (chemistry)|syneresis]].  Synchysis scintillans appears as small white [[floater]]s that freely move in the posterior part of the eye, giving a [[snow globe]] effect.  It is most commonly seen in eyes that have suffered from a degenerative disease and are end-stage.<ref name=Gelatt_1999>{{cite book|author=Gelatt, Kirk N. (ed.)|title=Veterinary Ophthalmology|edition=3rd|publisher=Lippincott, Williams & Wilkins|year=1999|isbn=0-683-30076-8}}</ref>

The condition is seen rarely. Associated with the advanced stages of [[diabetic retinopathy]], but the exact pathogenesis is unknown.
 
The condition is symptomless and untreatable. In ophthalmoscopic examination it appears as small, flat, yellow, highly refractive crystals of cholesterol floating freely in the vitreous. These will settle, due to gravity, if the eye is immobilized.
