'''Georgios Katidis''' ({{lang-el|Γεώργιος Κατίδης}}; born 12 February 1993) is a Greek professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as an [[attacking midfielder]]. He is best known for performing a [[Nazi salute]] after scoring a game winning goal in 2013, which led to his permanent suspension from every level of the [[Greece national football team|Greece national team]] and his suspension from [[AEK Athens F.C.|AEK Athens]] for the remainder of the 2013 season.

==Club career==

===Aris===
Katidis rose through the youth ranks at [[Aris F.C. (Thessaloniki)|Aris]] and managed to make his debut for the team at 16 years old.

===AEK Athens===
On 27 August 2012, Katidis signed a four-year contract with [[AEK Athens F.C.|AEK Athens]] which would keep him at the club until 2016. AEK Athens and his former club Aris agreed on a €100,000 transfer fee.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.aekfc.gr/index.asp?a_id=1355&n_id=7720 | title = Katidis signs with AEK | publisher = aekfc.gr | access-date = 27 August 2012 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20121101152952/http://www.aekfc.gr/index.asp?a_id=1355&n_id=7720 | archive-date = 1 November 2012 | url-status = dead }}</ref>

Katidis created an international controversy on 16 March 2013, when he gave a [[Nazi salute]] after scoring the winning goal against [[Veria F.C.|Veria]]. His action drew condemnation from politicians, fans and the media. He later told the public he was unaware of the gesture's connotations, stating that he just wanted to dedicate the goal to a colleague in the stands.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-21822165|title=Greek footballer Giorgos Katidis banned for Nazi salute|work=BBC News online|date=17 March 2013}}</ref> AEK coach [[Ewald Lienen]] remarked that Katidis "doesn't have an idea about politics".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2013/03/17/giorgos-katidis-nazi-salute-ban_n_2897092.html|title=Giorgos Katidis 'Nazi Salute' Earns Greek Footballer Lifetime National Ban|work=The Huffington Post|date=17 March 2013}}</ref>  As a result of the salute, the [[Hellenic Football Federation]] voted unanimously to give Katidis a lifetime ban from all Greece national teams and he was fined €50,000.<ref>{{cite web|title=Greek soccer player gets life ban for Nazi salute.

===Novara Calcio===
Italian [[Serie B]] side [[Novara Calcio|Novara]] signed Katidis. Novara's owner Massimo de Salvo said that they would not be 'playing down' the incident. "We don't have the intention to play down his gesture," he said. "It was disrespectful to the millions of people that suffered and paid with their lives for those who believed in false ideals and myths." De Salvo also said Katidis' remorse was a key factor in beginning negotiations with the 20-year-old. "We want to give him another chance, because we believe that making such a mistake is serious, but acknowledging it is worthy." The Italian media have dubbed Katidis the 'Greek Di Canio', referring to the former Lazio striker [[Paolo di Canio]], who caused controversy by giving a Nazi salute whilst celebrating a goal. Eventually Katidis signed a 1+1 year contract with the club.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://neoskosmos.com/news/el/node/32748|title=Katidis in talks with Italian side Novara|publisher=neoskosmos.com|date=12 July 2013|access-date=31 July 2014|archive-date=19 February 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150219230534/http://neoskosmos.com/news/el/node/32748|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.foxsportsasia.com/football/serie-a/news/detail/item990948/ |title=Relegated Novara sign controversial Katidis |publisher=foxsportsasia.com |date=12 July 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140812210548/http://www.foxsportsasia.com/football/serie-a/news/detail/item990948/ |archive-date=12 August 2014}}</ref>
