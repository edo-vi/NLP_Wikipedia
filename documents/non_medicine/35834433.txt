'''Matthaeus Platearius''' was a physician from the medical school at [[Salerno]], and is thought <ref>{{cite journal| pmc=2006232 | pmid=19977241 | volume=6 | title=Old English Herbals, 1525-1640 | year=1913 | author=Barlow HM | journal=Proc R Soc Med | issue=Sect Hist Med | pages=108â€“49}}</ref> to have produced a twelfth-century Latin manuscript on medicinal herbs titled "''Circa Instans''" (also known as "''The Book of Simple Medicines''"), later translated into French as "''Le Livre des simples medecines''". It was an alphabetic listing and textbook of [[Herbal medicine|simples]] that was based on [[Pedanius Dioscorides|Dioscorides]] "''Vulgaris''", which described the appearance, preparation, and uses of various drugs. It was widely acclaimed, and was one of the first herbals produced by the newly developed printing process in 1488. [[Ernst Heinrich Friedrich Meyer|Ernst Meyer]] considered it equal to the herbals of Pliny and Dioscorides, while [[George Sarton]] thought it an improvement on "''De Materia Medica''".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.lessing-photo.com/dispimg.asp?i=15020732+&cr=1&cl=1|title = NameBright - Coming Soon}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ibidispress.scriptmania.com/custom2.html |title=5.
