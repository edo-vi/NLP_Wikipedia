The '''universality–diversity paradigm''' is the analysis of [[Biogenic substance|biological materials]] based on the universality and diversity of its fundamental structural elements and functional mechanisms. The analysis of biological systems based on this classification has been a cornerstone of modern [[biology]].

For example, [[protein]]s constitute the elementary building blocks of a vast variety of biological materials such as [[Cell (biology)|cell]]s, [[spider silk]] or bone, where they create extremely robust, multi-functional materials by [[self-organization]] of structures over many length- and time scales, from nano to macro. Some of the structural features are commonly found in many different tissues, that is, they are [[Conserved sequence|conservation|highly conserved]]. Examples of such universal building blocks include [[alpha-helices]], [[beta-sheet]]s or [[tropocollagen]] molecules. In contrast, other features are highly specific to tissue types, such as particular [[Protein filament|filament]] assemblies, beta-sheet nanocrystals in spider silk or [[tendon]] fascicles. This coexistence of universality and diversity—referred to as the universality–diversity paradigm (UDP)—is an overarching feature in biological materials and a crucial component of [[materiomics]]. It might provide guidelines for bioinspired and [[biomimetic]] material development, where this concept is translated into the use of inorganic or hybrid organic-inorganic building blocks.
