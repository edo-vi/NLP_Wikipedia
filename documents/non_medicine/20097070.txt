'''Sessility''' is the [[biology|biological]] property of an [[organism]] describing its lack of a means of self-locomotion. Sessile organisms for which natural ''[[motility]]'' is absent are normally immobile. This is distinct from the botanical concept of [[Sessility (botany)|sessility]], which refers to an organism or biological structure attached directly by its base without a stalk.

Sessile organisms can move via external forces (such as water currents), but are usually permanently attached to something. Organisms such as [[coral]]s lay down their own [[substrate (biology)|substrate]] from which they grow. Other sessile organisms grow from a solid object, such as a rock, a dead tree trunk, or a man-made object such as a buoy or ship's hull.<ref>{{cite book|title=Biology of the Invertebrates|last=Pechenik|first=Jan|date=2016|isbn=9781497006515}}</ref>

==Mobility==
Sessile animals typically have a motile phase in their development. [[Sponge]]s have a motile [[larval]] stage and become sessile at maturity. Conversely, many [[jellyfish]] develop as sessile [[polyp (zoology)|polyp]]s early in their life cycle. In the case of the [[cochineal]], it is in the nymph stage (also called the crawler stage) that the cochineal disperses. The juveniles move to a feeding spot and produce long wax filaments. Later they move to the edge of the cactus pad where the wind catches the wax filaments and carries the tiny larval cochineals to a new host.

==Reproduction==
Many sessile animals, including sponges, [[coral]]s and [[hydra (genus)|hydra]], are capable of [[asexual reproduction]] ''[[in situ]]'' by the process of [[budding]]. Sessile organisms such as [[barnacle]]s and [[tunicate]]s need some mechanism to move their young into new territory. This is why the most widely accepted theory explaining the [[evolution]] of a [[larva]]l stage is the need for long-distance dispersal ability. Biologist [[Wayne Sousa]]'s 1979 study in intertidal disturbance added support for the theory of nonequilibrium community structure, "suggesting that open space is necessary for the maintenance of diversity in most communities of sessile organisms".<ref>{{cite journal |first=Wayne P. |last=Sousa |title=Disturbance in Marine Intertidal Boulder Fields: The Nonequilibrium Maintenance of Species Diversity |journal=Ecology |volume=60 |issue=6 |year=1979 |pages=1225â€“1239 |doi=10.2307/1936969 }}</ref>

==Clumping==

[[File:Blue mussel clump.jpg|thumb|280px|[[Blue mussel]]s, ''Mytilus edulis'', are sessile and exhibit clumping]]

Clumping is a behavior in sessile organisms in which individuals of a particular species group closely to one another for beneficial purposes, as can be seen in [[coral reef]]s and cochineal populations. This allows for faster reproduction and better protection from predators.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Ecology and Classification of North American Freshwater Invertebrates|author=James H. Thorp|author2=Alan P. Covich |publisher=[[Academic Press]]|page=213|date=2001|isbn=0-12-690647-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aj2ZMSekmHEC&q=Sessile+Limnology}}</ref>

==Predominance in coastal environments==
The [[littoral zone|circalittoral zone]] of [[coast]]al environments and [[biome]]s are dominated by sessile organisms such as [[oyster]]s. [[Carbonate platform]]s grow due to the buildup of skeletal remains of sessile organisms, usually [[microorganism]]s, which induce carbonate precipitation through their metabolism.

==Botanical sessility==
In anatomy and botany, ''sessility'' refers to an organism or biological structure that has no ''peduncle'' or stalk. A sessile structure has no stalk.
