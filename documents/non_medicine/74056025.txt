'''Four Core Genotypes''' ('''FCG''') mice are laboratory mice produced by [[genetic engineering]] that allow biomedical researchers to determine if a sex difference in phenotype is caused by effects of [[gonad]]al  [[Sex hormone|hormones]] or sex chromosome genes.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Arnold |first1=AP |last2=Chen |first2=X |title=What does the "four core genotypes" mouse model tell us about sex differences in the brain and other tissues? |journal=Front.

The comparison of XX and XY mice with the same type of gonad reveals sex differences in phenotypes that are caused by sex chromosome genes. The comparison of mice with different gonads but the same sex chromosomes reveals sex differences in phenotypes that are caused by gonadal hormones.

==Development==

The FCG model was created by [[Paul Burgoyne]]<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Turner |first1=JMA |last2=Mahadevaiah |first2=SK |last3=Arnold |first3=AP |last4=Lovell-Badge |first4=R. |title=Paul S. Burgoyne (1946-2020) |journal=Development |date=2020 |volume=147 |issue=20|doi=10.1242/dev.197467 |pmid=33109617 |s2cid=225100609 |doi-access=free }}</ref> and [[Robin Lovell-Badge]] at the National Institute for Medical Research, London (now [[Francis Crick Institute]]). The model involves deleting the testis-determining gene [[SRY|Sry]] from the Y chromosome, and inserting Sry onto [[chromosome]] 3. Therefore the sex chromosomes no longer determine the type of gonad, so that XX and XY mice can have the same type of gonad and gonadal hormones.

==Significance==

The FCG model has been used to discover that the XX and XY animals respond differently in models of human [[physiology]] and [[disease]], including [[autoimmunity]], [[metabolism]], [[cardiovascular disease]], [[cancer]], [[Alzheimer's disease|Alzheimer’s disease]], and neural and behavioral processes.<ref name=":0" /><ref>{{cite book|last1=Arnold |first1=AP |title= Sex Determination in Vertebrates|chapter=Rethinking sex determination of non-gonadal tissues |series=Current Topics in Developmental Biology |date=2019 |volume=134 |pages=289–315 |doi=10.1016/bs.ctdb.2019.01.003 |pmid=30999979|pmc=7485614 |isbn=9780128115442 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Voskuhl |first1=RR. |title=The effect of sex on multiple sclerosis risk and disease progression. |journal=Mult Scler. |date=2020 |volume=26 |issue=5 |pages=554–60|doi=10.1177/1352458519892491 |pmid=31965884 |pmc=7160019 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Zore |first1=T |last2=Palafox |first2=M |last3=Reue |first3=K |title=Sex differences in obesity, lipid metabolism, and inflammation-A role for the sex chromosomes? |journal=Mol Metab. |date=2018 |volume=15 |pages=35–44|doi=10.1016/j.molmet.2018.04.003 |pmid=29706320 |pmc=6066740 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Reue |first1=K |last2=Wiese |first2=CB |title=Illuminating the Mechanisms Underlying Sex Differences in Cardiovascular Disease. |journal=Circ.
