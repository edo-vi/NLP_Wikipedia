{{Short description|Brand of castration devices}}
[[Image:Burdizo 9in.jpg|right|thumb|A {{convert|9|in|mm|-1|order=flip|abbr=on}} Burdizzo, used primarily on [[goats]], small calves, and sometimes on humans.]]

The '''Burdizzo''' is the name brand of a company that makes a [[castration]] device which employs a large clamp designed to break the [[blood vessel]]s leading into the [[testicles]]. Once the [[blood supply]] to the testicles is lost, testicular [[necrosis]] occurs, and the testicles shrink, soften, and eventually deteriorate completely. When the device is used, the operator crushes the spermatic cords one at a time, leaving a space in between in order to prevent an interruption of blood-flow to the [[scrotum]].

The Burdizzo is used primarily on farm animals such as cattle and sheep.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Hebert |first=Ernest |date=1986-10-26 |title=MUD AND SYRUP |language=en-US |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/26/books/mud-and-syrup.html |access-date=2022-04-04 |issn=0362-4331}}</ref> For example, pampered [[cattle]], used for [[Kobe beef]], are often castrated by this method because of the reduced risk of bleeding and [[infection]].<ref>{{cite web|author=U.S.A. |url=http://www.believermag.com/issues/200306/?read=tool_emasculatone |title=The Believer - Tool: The BurdizzoÂ® Emasculatone 9 |publisher=Believermag.com |date=2003-06-01 |accessdate=2016-07-20}}</ref>

==Humans==

Burdizzos have also been used by some human males as a means of self-castration;<ref name="miami new times">{{Cite web |url=http://www.miaminewtimes.com/2000-06-29/news/my-life-as-a-eunuch/5/ |title=Miami New Times |access-date=2011-02-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110917162400/http://www.miaminewtimes.com/2000-06-29/news/my-life-as-a-eunuch/5/ |archive-date=2011-09-17 |url-status=dead }}</ref> though it lessens the risk of infection as no skin is broken, it is considered unsafe for humans, as the Burdizzo was not originally designed for human use, and causes blunt force trauma to the spermatic cords, which are thickly wrapped in nerve fibres.<ref name="miami new times"/>
