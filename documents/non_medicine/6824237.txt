[[MTV]]'s '''Buzz Bin''' was a select group of [[music video]]s by up and coming artists and bands that the network deemed "buzz worthy", "[[wikt:cutting edge|cutting edge]]", or "the next big thing". As such, the selected videos received heavy rotation on the channel, and were also featured in special promotional commercials that highlighted the latest Buzz Bin selections, which were sometimes known as '''Buzz Clips'''.<ref name=NYT/>

The Buzz Bin began in 1987, and featured artists and bands from all genres of music (not just [[alternative rock]] or [[modern rock]] acts, although those were the majority). Many music industry trade publications have noted the direct effect Buzz Bin selection has had on album sales, with some sources stating that upwards of 75% of the selected acts have gone on to achieve [[RIAA]] Gold Certification or better.<ref name="ew">{{cite web |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,296425,00.html |title=Taking Care Of Buzz-Iness: Meet Alternative Rock's Best Friend |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=March 17, 1995 |access-date=July 14, 2014 |archive-date=October 6, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006100945/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,296425,00.html |url-status=dead }}</ref> In 1992, ''The New York Times'' noted the Buzz Bin label's power in increasing sales and creating hit songs<ref name=NYT>{{cite web|first=Robert G.|last=Woletz |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/08/02/arts/pop-music-a-new-formula-into-the-bin-out-comes-a-hit.html?pagewanted=1 |title=POP MUSIC; A New Formula: Into the 'Bin.'

In an article published in the journal of Music and Science, Osborn, Rossin, and Weingarten conducted a thorough content analysis of 288 Buzz Clips videos to "assess the kinds of people and cultural practices MTV promoted as buzzworthy in the 1990s."<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Osborn|first=Brad|last2=Rossin|first2=Emily|last3=Weingarten|first3=Kevin|date=2020-01-01|title=Content and Correlational Analysis of a Corpus of MTV-Promoted Music Videos Aired Between 1990 and 1999|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/2059204320902369|journal=Music & Science|language=en|volume=3|pages=2059204320902369|doi=10.1177/2059204320902369|issn=2059-2043|doi-access=free}}</ref> The study found high degrees of correlation between gender ethnicity, instrumentation, and genre: BIPOC musicians' videos were often coded as hip-hop or R&B, featuring drum machines and keyboards; white musicians' videos featured more electric guitars; and women were shown playing instruments with less frequency than men.

The Buzz Bin ended in 2004 and was split in half into MTV's "[[Discover and Download]]" and VH1's "You Oughta Know".

MTV released two compilation CDs of Buzz Bin tracks, on [[Mammoth Records]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/MTV-Buzz-Bin-Zen-Clips/dp/B000004ATC |title=MTV Buzz Bin, Volume 1: The Zen of Buzz Clips: Music |publisher=Amazon.com |access-date=July 14, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/MTV-Buzz-Bin-Future-Clips/dp/B000004ATM |title=MTV Buzz Bin Volume 2: The Future of Buzz Clips: Music |publisher=Amazon.com |access-date=July 14, 2014}}</ref>
