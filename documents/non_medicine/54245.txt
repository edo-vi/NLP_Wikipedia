The first person to use the concept of a "singularity" in the technological context was the 20th-century Hungarian-American mathematician [[John von Neumann]].<ref>''The Technological Singularity'' by Murray Shanahan, (MIT Press, 2015), p. 233.</ref> [[Stanislaw Ulam]] reports in 1958 an earlier discussion with von Neumann "centered on the [[Accelerating change|accelerating progress]] of technology and changes in the mode of human life, which gives the appearance of approaching some essential [[Wiktionary:singularity|singularity]] in the history of the race beyond which human affairs, as we know them, could not continue".<ref name="ulam1958" /> Subsequent authors have echoed this viewpoint.<ref name="Singularity hypotheses" /><ref name="chalmers2010"/>

The concept and the term "singularity" were popularized by [[Vernor Vinge]] first in 1983 in an article that claimed that once humans create intelligences greater than their own, there will be a technological and social transition similar in some sense to "the knotted space-time at the center of a black hole",<ref name="dooling2008-88"/> and later in his 1993 essay ''The Coming Technological Singularity'',<ref name="vinge1993" /><ref name="chalmers2010"/> in which he wrote that it would signal the end of the human era, as the new superintelligence would continue to upgrade itself and would advance technologically at an incomprehensible rate. He wrote that he would be surprised if it occurred before 2005 or after 2030.<ref name="vinge1993"/> Another significant contributor to wider circulation of the notion was [[Ray Kurzweil]]'s 2005 book ''[[The Singularity Is Near]]'', predicting singularity by 2045.<ref name="chalmers2010"/>

== Intelligence explosion ==
Although technological progress has been accelerating in most areas, it has been limited by the basic intelligence of the human brain, which has not, according to [[Paul R. Ehrlich]], changed significantly for millennia.<ref name="Paul Ehrlich June 2008">{{Cite web |last=Ehrlich |first=Paul |title=Paul Ehrlich: The Dominant Animal: Human Evolution and the Environment – The Long Now |url=https://longnow.org/seminars/02008/jun/27/dominant-animal-human-evolution-and-environment/ |access-date=2023-06-14 |website=longnow.org}}</ref> However, with the increasing power of computers and other technologies, it might eventually be possible to build a machine that is significantly more intelligent than humans.<ref name="businessweek">{{Cite web |date=2023-04-20 |title=Businessweek – Bloomberg |url=https://bloomberg.com/businessweek |access-date=2023-06-14 |website=Bloomberg.com |language=en}}</ref>

If a superhuman intelligence were to be invented—either through the [[Intelligence amplification|amplification of human intelligence]] or through artificial intelligence—it would vastly improve over human problem-solving and inventive skills. Such an AI is referred to as '''Seed AI'''<ref name="Yampolskiy, Roman V 2015">Yampolskiy, Roman V. "Analysis of types of self-improving software." Artificial General Intelligence. Springer International Publishing, 2015. pp. 384–393.</ref><ref name="ReferenceA">[[Eliezer Yudkowsky]]. General Intelligence and Seed AI-Creating Complete Minds Capable of Open-Ended Self-Improvement, 2001</ref> because if an AI were created with engineering capabilities that matched or surpassed those of its human creators, it would have the potential to autonomously improve its own software and hardware to design an even more capable machine, which could repeat the process in turn. This recursive self-improvement could accelerate, potentially allowing enormous qualitative change before any upper limits imposed by the laws of physics or theoretical computation set in. It is speculated that over many iterations, such an AI [[Superintelligence|would far surpass human cognitive abilities]].

[[I. J. Good]] speculated in 1965 that superhuman intelligence might bring about an intelligence explosion:<ref name="good1965"/><ref name="good1965-stat"/>
{{blockquote|Let an ultraintelligent machine be defined as a machine that can far surpass all the intellectual activities of any man however clever. Since the design of machines is one of these intellectual activities, an ultraintelligent machine could design even better machines; there would then unquestionably be an 'intelligence explosion', and the intelligence of man would be left far behind. Thus the first ultraintelligent machine is the last invention that man need ever make, provided that the machine is docile enough to tell us how to keep it under control.}}

One version of intelligence explosion is where computing power approaches infinity in a finite amount of time. In this version, once AIs are doing the research to improve themselves, speed doubles e.g. after 2 years, then 1 year, then 6 months, then 3 months, then 1.5 months, etc., where the infinite sum of the doubling periods is 4 years. Unless prevented by physical limits of computation and time quantization, this process would literally achieve infinite computing power in 4 years, properly earning the name "singularity" for the final state. This form of intelligence explosion is described in Yudkowsky (1996).<ref name="yudkowsky1996"/>

==Emergence of superintelligence==
{{Further|Superintelligence}}
A superintelligence, hyperintelligence, or superhuman intelligence is a hypothetical [[intelligent agent|agent]] that possesses intelligence far surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted human minds. "Superintelligence" may also refer to the form or degree of intelligence possessed by such an agent. [[John von Neumann]], [[Vernor Vinge]] and [[Ray Kurzweil]] define the concept in terms of the technological creation of super intelligence, arguing that it is difficult or impossible for present-day humans to predict what human beings' lives would be like in a post-singularity world.<ref name="vinge1993"/><ref name="kurzweil2005-135"/>

The related concept "speed superintelligence" describes an AI that can function like a human mind, only much faster.<ref>{{cite book |author=Sotala |first1=Kaj |title=The Technological Singularity |last2=Yampolskiy |first2=Roman |publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg |year=2017 |isbn=978-3-662-54031-2 |series=The Frontiers Collection |pages=11–23 |chapter=Risks of the Journey to the Singularity |doi=10.1007/978-3-662-54033-6_2}}</ref> For example, with a million-fold increase in the speed of information processing relative to that of humans, a subjective year would pass in 30 physical seconds.<ref name="singinst.org"/> Such a difference in information processing speed could drive the singularity.<ref name="chalmers2016">{{cite book |author=Chalmers |first=David J. |title=Science Fiction and Philosophy |publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Inc |year=2016 |isbn=9781118922590 |pages=171–224 |chapter=The Singularity |doi=10.1002/9781118922590.ch16}}</ref>

Technology forecasters and researchers disagree regarding when, or whether, human intelligence will likely be surpassed. Some argue that advances in [[artificial intelligence]] (AI) will probably result in general reasoning systems that bypass human cognitive limitations. Others believe that humans will evolve or directly modify their biology so as to achieve radically greater intelligence.<ref>{{Citation|last=Pearce|first=David|title=The Biointelligence Explosion|date=2012|url=http://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-3-642-32560-1_11|work=Singularity Hypotheses|series=The Frontiers Collection|pages=199–238|editor-last=Eden|editor-first=Amnon H.|place=Berlin, Heidelberg|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-32560-1_11|isbn=978-3-642-32559-5|access-date=2022-01-16|editor2-last=Moor|editor2-first=James H.|editor3-last=Søraker|editor3-first=Johnny H.|editor4-last=Steinhart|editor4-first=Eric}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=The Age of Artificial Intelligence: An Exploration|year=2020|isbn=978-1-62273-872-4|editor-last=Gouveia|editor-first=Steven S.|chapter=ch. 4, "Humans and Intelligent Machines: Co-evolution, Fusion or Replacement?", David Pearce|publisher=Vernon Press |chapter-url=https://www.biointelligence-explosion.com/parable.html}}</ref> A number of [[futures studies]] focus on scenarios that combine these possibilities, suggesting that humans are likely to [[brain–computer interface|interface with computers]], or [[mind uploading|upload their minds to computers]], in a way that enables substantial intelligence amplification. The book ''[[The Age of Em]]'' by [[Robin Hanson]] describes a hypothetical future scenario in which human brains are scanned and digitized, creating "uploads" or digital versions of human consciousness. In this future, the development of these uploads may precede or coincide with the emergence of superintelligent artificial intelligence.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hanson |first=Robin |author-link=Robin Hanson |date=2016 |title=The Age of Em |url=https://ageofem.com/ |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=528 |isbn=9780198754626}}</ref>

==Plausibility==
Prominent technologists and academics dispute the plausibility of a technological singularity, including [[Paul Allen]],<ref name="Allen2011"/> [[Jeff Hawkins]],<ref name="ieee-lumi"/> [[John Henry Holland|John Holland]], [[Jaron Lanier]], [[Steven Pinker]],<ref name="ieee-lumi"/> [[Theodore Modis]],<ref name="modis2012"/> and [[Gordon Moore]],<ref name="ieee-lumi"/> whose [[Moore's law|law]] is often cited in support of the concept.<ref name="ieee-whos-who"/>

Most proposed methods for creating superhuman or [[transhuman]] minds fall into one of two categories: intelligence amplification of human brains and artificial intelligence. The many speculated ways to augment human intelligence include [[bioengineering]], [[genetic engineering]], [[nootropic]] drugs, AI assistants, direct [[brain–computer interface]]s and [[mind uploading]]. These multiple possible paths to an intelligence explosion, all of which will presumably be pursued, makes a singularity more likely.<ref name="singinst.org">{{cite web|url=http://singinst.org/overview/whatisthesingularity |title=What is the Singularity? &#124; Singularity Institute for Artificial Intelligence |publisher=Singinst.org |access-date=2011-09-09 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110908014050/http://singinst.org/overview/whatisthesingularity/ |archive-date=2011-09-08 }}</ref>

The possibility of an intelligence explosion depends on three factors.<ref name="david_chalmers_singularity_lecture_resources_available">David Chalmers John Locke Lecture, 10 May, Exam Schools, Oxford, [http://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/news/2010/david_chalmers_singularity_lecture_resources_available Presenting a philosophical analysis of the possibility of a technological singularity or "intelligence explosion" resulting from recursively self-improving AI] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115205558/http://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/news/2010/david_chalmers_singularity_lecture_resources_available |date=2013-01-15 }}.</ref> The first accelerating factor is the new intelligence enhancements made possible by each previous improvement. Contrariwise, as the intelligences become more advanced, further advances will become more and more complicated, possibly outweighing the advantage of increased intelligence. Each improvement should generate at least one more improvement, on average, for movement towards singularity to continue. Finally, the laws of physics may eventually prevent further improvement.

There are two logically independent, but mutually reinforcing, causes of intelligence improvements: increases in the speed of computation, and improvements to the [[algorithm]]s used.<ref name="chalmers2010"/> The former is predicted by [[Moore's law|Moore's Law]] and the forecasted improvements in hardware,<ref name="itrs">{{cite web |url=http://www.itrs.net/Links/2007ITRS/ExecSum2007.pdf |title=ITRS |access-date=2011-09-09 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929173755/http://www.itrs.net/Links/2007ITRS/ExecSum2007.pdf |archive-date=2011-09-29 }}</ref> and is comparatively similar to previous technological advances.

A 2017 email survey of authors with publications at the 2015 [[Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems|NeurIPS]] and [[International Conference on Machine Learning|ICML]] machine learning conferences asked about the chance that "the intelligence explosion argument is broadly correct".

== Speed improvements ==
Both for human and artificial intelligence, hardware improvements increase the rate of future hardware improvements. An analogy to [[Moore's Law]] suggests that if the first doubling of speed took 18 months, the second would take 18 subjective months; or 9 external months, whereafter, four months, two months, and so on towards a speed singularity.<ref name="arstechnica">{{cite web |last=Siracusa |first=John |date=2009-08-31 |title=Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard: the Ars Technica review |url=https://arstechnica.com/apple/reviews/2009/08/mac-os-x-10-6.ars/8 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903191143/http://arstechnica.com/apple/reviews/2009/08/mac-os-x-10-6.ars/8 |archive-date=2011-09-03 |access-date=2011-09-09 |work=Ars Technica}}</ref><ref name="yudkowsky1996"/> Some upper limit on speed may eventually be reached. Jeff Hawkins has stated that a self-improving computer system would inevitably run into upper limits on computing power: "in the end there are limits to how big and fast computers can run. We would end up in the same place; we'd just get there a bit faster. There would be no singularity."<ref name="ieee-lumi"/>

It is difficult to directly compare [[silicon]]-based hardware with [[neuron]]s. But {{Harvtxt|Berglas|2008}} notes that computer [[speech recognition]] is approaching human capabilities, and that this capability seems to require 0.01% of the volume of the brain. This analogy suggests that modern computer hardware is within a few orders of magnitude of being as powerful as the human brain.

===Exponential growth===
[[Image:PPTMooresLawai.jpg|thumb|upright=1.8|Ray Kurzweil writes that, due to [[paradigm shift]]s, a trend of exponential growth extends [[Moore's law]] from [[integrated circuits]] to earlier [[transistor]]s, [[vacuum tube]]s, [[relay]]s, and [[electromechanics|electromechanical]] computers. He predicts that the exponential growth will continue, and that in a few decades the computing power of all computers will exceed that of ("unenhanced") human brains, with superhuman [[artificial intelligence]] appearing around the same time.]]
[[File:Moore's Law over 120 Years.png|thumb|upright=1.8|An updated version of Moore's law over 120 Years (based on [[Ray Kurzweil|Kurzweil's]] [[c:File:PPTMooresLawai.jpg|graph]]). The 7 most recent data points are all [[Nvidia GPUs]].]]

The exponential growth in computing technology suggested by Moore's law is commonly cited as a reason to expect a singularity in the relatively near future, and a number of authors have proposed generalizations of Moore's law. Computer scientist and futurist [[Hans Moravec]] proposed in a 1998 book<ref>{{cite book|author=Moravec, Hans|title=Robot: Mere Machine to Transcendent Mind|year=1999|publisher=Oxford U. Press|page=61|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fduW6KHhWtQC&pg=PA61|isbn=978-0-19-513630-2}}</ref> that the exponential growth curve could be extended back through earlier computing technologies prior to the [[integrated circuit]].

[[Ray Kurzweil]] postulates a [[law of accelerating returns]] in which the speed of technological change (and more generally, all evolutionary processes<ref name="kurzweil1999"/>) increases exponentially, generalizing Moore's law in the same manner as Moravec's proposal, and also including material technology (especially as applied to [[nanotechnology]]), [[Medical Technology|medical technology]] and others.<ref name="kurzweil2005"/> Between 1986 and 2007, machines' application-specific capacity to compute information per capita roughly doubled every 14 months; the per capita capacity of the world's general-purpose computers has doubled every 18 months; the global telecommunication capacity per capita doubled every 34 months; and the world's storage capacity per capita doubled every 40 months.<ref name="HilbertLopez2011">[https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1200970 "The World's Technological Capacity to Store, Communicate, and Compute Information"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130727161911/http://www.sciencemag.org/content/332/6025/60 |date=2013-07-27 }}, Martin Hilbert and Priscila López (2011), [[Science (journal)|Science]], 332(6025), 60–65; free access to the article through here: martinhilbert.net/WorldInfoCapacity.html</ref> On the other hand, it has been argued that the global acceleration pattern having the 21st century singularity as its parameter should be characterized as [[Hyperbolic growth|hyperbolic]] rather than exponential.<ref>{{Cite journal |date=2020 |editor-last=Korotayev |editor-first=Andrey V. |editor2-last=LePoire |editor2-first=David J. |title=The 21st Century Singularity and Global Futures |url=https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-33730-8 |journal=World-Systems Evolution and Global Futures |language=en |doi=10.1007/978-3-030-33730-8 |isbn=978-3-030-33729-2 |s2cid=241407141 |issn=2522-0985}}</ref>

Kurzweil reserves the term "singularity" for a rapid increase in artificial intelligence (as opposed to other technologies), writing for example that "The Singularity will allow us to transcend these limitations of our biological bodies and brains ... There will be no distinction, post-Singularity, between human and machine".<ref name="kurzweil2005-9"/> He also defines his predicted date of the singularity (2045) in terms of when he expects computer-based intelligences to significantly exceed the sum total of human brainpower, writing that advances in computing before that date "will not represent the Singularity" because they do "not yet correspond to a profound expansion of our intelligence."<ref name="kurzweil2005-135136"/>
===Accelerating change===
[[File:ParadigmShiftsFrr15Events.svg|thumb|upright=1.8|According to Kurzweil, his [[logarithmic scale|logarithmic graph]] of 15 lists of [[paradigm shift]]s for key [[human history|historic]] events shows an [[exponential growth|exponential]] trend.]]
{{Main|Accelerating change}}

Some singularity proponents argue its inevitability through extrapolation of past trends, especially those pertaining to shortening gaps between improvements to technology. In one of the first uses of the term "singularity" in the context of technological progress, [[Stanislaw Ulam]] tells of a conversation with [[John von Neumann]] about accelerating change: {{blockquote|One conversation centered on the ever accelerating progress of technology and changes in the mode of human life, which gives the appearance of approaching some essential singularity in the history of the race beyond which human affairs, as we know them, could not continue.<ref name="ulam1958"/>}}

Kurzweil claims that technological progress follows a pattern of [[exponential growth]], following what he calls the "[[law of accelerating returns]]". Whenever technology approaches a barrier, Kurzweil writes, new technologies will surmount it. He predicts [[paradigm shift]]s will become increasingly common, leading to "technological change so rapid and profound it represents a rupture in the fabric of human history".<ref name="Kurzweil 2001">{{Citation

}}</ref> Kurzweil believes that the singularity will occur by approximately 2045.<ref name="kurzweil2005"/> His predictions differ from Vinge's in that he predicts a gradual ascent to the singularity, rather than Vinge's rapidly self-improving superhuman intelligence.

Oft-cited dangers include those commonly associated with molecular nanotechnology and [[genetic engineering]]. These threats are major issues for both singularity advocates and critics, and were the subject of [[Bill Joy]]'s April 2000 ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' magazine article "[[Why The Future Doesn't Need Us]]".<ref name="chalmers2010" /><ref name="Joy2000"/>

== Algorithm improvements ==
Some intelligence technologies, like "seed AI",<ref name="Yampolskiy, Roman V 2015"/><ref name="ReferenceA"/> may also have the potential to not just make themselves faster, but also more efficient, by modifying their [[source code]]. These improvements would make further improvements possible, which would make further improvements possible, and so on.

The mechanism for a recursively self-improving set of algorithms differs from an increase in raw computation speed in two ways. First, it does not require external influence: machines designing faster hardware would still require humans to create the improved hardware, or to program factories appropriately.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} An AI rewriting its own source code could do so while contained in an [[AI box]].

Second, as with [[Vernor Vinge]]'s conception of the singularity, it is much harder to predict the outcome. While speed increases seem to be only a quantitative difference from human intelligence, actual algorithm improvements would be qualitatively different. [[Eliezer Yudkowsky]] compares it to the changes that human intelligence brought: humans changed the world thousands of times more rapidly than evolution had done, and in totally different ways. Similarly, the evolution of life was a massive departure and acceleration from the previous geological rates of change, and improved intelligence could cause change to be as different again.<ref name="yudkowsky">{{cite web |author=Yudkowsky |first=Eliezer S. |title=Power of Intelligence |url=http://yudkowsky.net/singularity/power |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181003033529/http://yudkowsky.net/singularity/power |archive-date=2018-10-03 |access-date=2011-09-09 |publisher=Yudkowsky}}</ref>

There are substantial dangers associated with an intelligence explosion singularity originating from a recursively self-improving set of algorithms. First, the goal structure of the AI might self-modify, potentially causing the AI to optimise for something other than what was originally intended.<ref name="selfawaresystems">{{Cite web |url=http://selfawaresystems.com/2007/11/30/paper-on-the-basic-ai-drives/ |title=Omohundro, Stephen M., "The Basic AI Drives."

[[Carl Shulman]] and [[Anders Sandberg]] suggest that algorithm improvements may be the limiting factor for a singularity; while hardware efficiency tends to improve at a steady pace, software innovations are more unpredictable and may be bottlenecked by serial, cumulative research. They suggest that in the case of a software-limited singularity, intelligence explosion would actually become more likely than with a hardware-limited singularity, because in the software-limited case, once human-level AI is developed, it could run serially on very fast hardware, and the abundance of cheap hardware would make AI research less constrained.<ref name="ShulmanSandberg2010">{{cite journal |last1=Shulman |first1=Carl |last2=Sandberg |first2=Anders |year=2010 |editor1-last=Mainzer |editor1-first=Klaus |title=Implications of a Software-Limited Singularity |url=http://intelligence.org/files/SoftwareLimited.pdf |url-status=live |journal=ECAP10: VIII European Conference on Computing and Philosophy |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190430061928/https://intelligence.org/files/SoftwareLimited.pdf |archive-date=30 April 2019 |access-date=17 May 2014}}</ref> An abundance of accumulated hardware that can be unleashed once the software figures out how to use it has been called "computing overhang".<ref name="MuehlhauserSalamon2012">{{cite book |last1=Muehlhauser |first1=Luke |title=Singularity Hypotheses: A Scientific and Philosophical Assessment |last2=Salamon |first2=Anna |publisher=Springer |year=2012 |editor=Eden |editor-first=Amnon |chapter=Intelligence Explosion: Evidence and Import |access-date=2018-08-28 |editor2=Søraker |editor-first2=Johnny |editor3=Moor |editor-first3=James H. |editor4=Steinhart |editor-first4=Eric |chapter-url=http://intelligence.org/files/IE-EI.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141026105011/http://intelligence.org/files/IE-EI.pdf |archive-date=2014-10-26 |url-status=live}}</ref>

==Criticism==
Some critics, like philosopher [[Hubert Dreyfus]]<ref name="dreyfus2000"/> and philosopher [[John Searle]],<ref>John R. Searle, “What Your Computer Can’t Know”, ''The New York Review of Books'', 9 October 2014, p. 54.: "[Computers] have, literally ..., no intelligence, no motivation, no autonomy, and no agency. We design them to behave as if they had certain sorts of psychology, but there is no psychological reality to the corresponding processes or behavior. ...  [T]he machinery has no beliefs, desires, [or] motivations."</ref> assert that computers or machines cannot achieve [[human intelligence]]. Others, like physicist [[Stephen Hawking]],<ref name="hawking2018"/> object that whether machines can achieve a true intelligence or merely something similar to intelligence is irrelevant if the net result is the same.

Psychologist [[Steven Pinker]] stated in 2008: "There is not the slightest reason to believe in a coming singularity. The fact that you can visualize a future in your imagination is not evidence that it is likely or even possible. Look at domed cities, jet-pack commuting, underwater cities, mile-high buildings, and nuclear-powered automobiles—all staples of futuristic fantasies when I was a child that have never arrived. Sheer processing power is not a pixie dust that magically solves all your problems. ..."<ref name="ieee-lumi"/>

[[Martin Ford (author)|Martin Ford]]<ref name="ford2009"/> postulates a "technology paradox" in that before the singularity could occur most routine jobs in the economy would be automated, since this would require a level of technology inferior to that of the singularity. This would cause massive unemployment and plummeting consumer demand, which in turn would destroy the incentive to invest in the technologies that would be required to bring about the Singularity. Job displacement is increasingly no longer limited to those types of work traditionally considered to be "routine".<ref name="markoff2011"/>

<!-- Rate of technological innovation: -->[[Theodore Modis]]<ref name="modis2002"/> and [[Jonathan Huebner]]<ref name="huebner2005"/> argue that the rate of technological innovation has not only ceased to rise, but is actually now declining. Evidence for this decline is that the rise in computer [[clock rate]]s is slowing, even while Moore's prediction of exponentially increasing circuit density continues to hold. This is due to excessive heat build-up from the chip, which cannot be dissipated quickly enough to prevent the chip from melting when operating at higher speeds. Advances in speed may be possible in the future by virtue of more power-efficient CPU designs and multi-cell processors.<ref name="krazit2006"/>

AI researcher [[Jürgen Schmidhuber]] stated that the frequency of subjectively "notable events" appears to be approaching a 21st-century singularity, but cautioned readers to take such plots of subjective events with a grain of salt: perhaps differences in memory of recent and distant events could create an illusion of accelerating change where none exists.<ref>{{Citation |last=Schmidhuber |first=Jürgen |title=New millennium AI and the convergence of history |year=2006|arxiv=cs/0606081 |bibcode=2006cs........6081S }}</ref>

Microsoft co-founder [[Paul Allen]] argued the opposite of accelerating returns, the complexity brake;<ref name="Allen2011"/> the more progress science makes towards understanding intelligence, the more difficult it becomes to make additional progress. A study of the number of patents shows that human creativity does not show accelerating returns, but in fact, as suggested by [[Joseph Tainter]] in his ''The Collapse of Complex Societies'',<ref name="tainter1988"/> a law of [[diminishing returns]]. The number of patents per thousand peaked in the period from 1850 to 1900, and has been declining since.<ref name="huebner2005" /><!--[Previous comment: is this from 'Collapse of Complex Societies' or some other source? Perhaps this refers to Jonathan Huebner's patent analysis mentioned in the earlier paragraph? If so, would be better to integrate this part with that paragraph, since the earlier paragraph mentions that Huebner's analysis has been criticized whereas this paragraph just seems to present it as fact --> The growth of complexity eventually becomes self-limiting, and leads to a widespread "general systems collapse".

[[Douglas Hofstadter|Hofstadter]] (2006) raises concern that Ray Kurzweil is not sufficiently scientifically rigorous, that an exponential tendency of technology is not a scientific law like one of physics, and that exponential curves have no "knees".<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nhj6fDDnckE Trying to Muse Rationally About the Singularity Scenario] by Douglas Hofstadter, 2006, [https://web.archive.org/web/20170109020308/https://medium.com/@emergingtechnology/trying-to-muse-rationally-about-the-singularity-scenario-9c9db2eb9ece unauthorized transcript]</ref> Nonetheless, he did not rule out the singularity in principle in the distant future<ref name="ieee-lumi"/> and in the light of [[ChatGPT]] and other recent advancements has revised his opinion significantly towards dramatic technological change in the near future.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Brooks |first=David |date=2023-07-13 |title=Opinion {{!}} 'Human Beings Are Soon Going to Be Eclipsed' |language=en-US |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/13/opinion/ai-chatgpt-consciousness-hofstadter.html |access-date=2023-08-02 |issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

[[Jaron Lanier]] denies that the singularity is inevitable: "I do not think the technology is creating itself.

Economist [[Robert J. Gordon]] points out that measured economic growth slowed around 1970 and slowed even further since the [[financial crisis of 2007–2008]], and argues that the economic data show no trace of a coming Singularity as imagined by mathematician [[I. J. Good]].<ref>[[William D. Nordhaus]], "Why Growth Will Fall" (a review of [[Robert J. Gordon]], ''The Rise and Fall of American Growth:  The U.S. Standard of Living Since the Civil War'', Princeton University Press, 2016, {{ISBN|978-0691147727}}, 762 pp., $39.95), ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', vol. LXIII, no. 13 (August 18, 2016), p. 68.</ref>

Philosopher and cognitive scientist [[Daniel Dennett]] said in 2017: "The whole singularity stuff, that's preposterous. It distracts us from much more pressing problems", adding "AI tools that we become hyper-dependent on, that is going to happen. And one of the dangers is that we will give them more authority than they warrant."<ref>{{Citation |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/feb/12/daniel-dennett-politics-bacteria-bach-back-dawkins-trump-interview |title=Daniel Dennett: 'I begrudge every hour I have to spend worrying about politics' |date=12 February 2017 |work=[[The Guardian]] |first=Carole |last=Cadwalladr |author-link=Carole Cadwalladr}}</ref>

In addition to general criticisms of the singularity concept, several critics have raised issues with Kurzweil's iconic chart. One line of criticism is that a [[Log-log plot|log-log]] chart of this nature is inherently biased toward a straight-line result. Others identify selection bias in the points that Kurzweil chooses to use. For example, biologist [[PZ Myers]] points out that many of the early evolutionary "events" were picked arbitrarily.<ref name="PZMyers2009"/> Kurzweil has rebutted this by charting evolutionary events from 15 neutral sources, and showing that they fit a straight line on [[:File:ParadigmShiftsFrr15Events.svg|a log-log chart]]. [[Kevin Kelly (editor)|Kelly]] (2006) argues that the way the Kurzweil chart is constructed with x-axis having time before present, it always points to the singularity being "now", for any date on which one would construct such a chart, and shows this visually on Kurzweil's chart.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Kelly |first=Kevin |date=2006 |title=The Singularity Is Always Near |url=https://kk.org/thetechnium/the-singularity/ |access-date=2023-06-14 |website=The Technium}}</ref>

<!-- religious semblance: -->Some critics suggest religious motivations or implications of singularity, especially Kurzweil's version of it.

==Potential impacts==
Dramatic changes in the rate of economic growth have occurred in the past because of technological advancement. Based on population growth, the economy doubled every 250,000 years from the [[Paleolithic]] era until the [[Neolithic Revolution]]. The new agricultural economy doubled every 900 years, a remarkable increase. In the current era, beginning with the Industrial Revolution, the world's economic output doubles every fifteen years, sixty times faster than during the agricultural era. If the rise of superhuman intelligence causes a similar revolution, argues Robin Hanson, one would expect the economy to double at least quarterly and possibly on a weekly basis.<ref name="Hanson">{{Citation |url=https://www.spectrum.ieee.org/robotics/robotics-software/economics-of-the-singularity |title=Economics Of The Singularity |first=Robin |last=Hanson |date=1 June 2008 |work=IEEE Spectrum Special Report: The Singularity |access-date=2009-07-25 |archive-date=2011-08-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811005825/http://spectrum.ieee.org/robotics/robotics-software/economics-of-the-singularity |url-status=live }} & [http://hanson.gmu.edu/longgrow.pdf Long-Term Growth As A Sequence of Exponential Modes] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190527020444/https://spectrum.ieee.org/robotics/robotics-software/economics-of-the-singularity |date=2019-05-27 }}</ref>

{{Harvtxt|Bostrom|2002}} discusses human extinction scenarios, and lists superintelligence as a possible cause:
{{blockquote|When we create the first superintelligent entity, we might make a mistake and give it goals that lead it to annihilate humankind, assuming its enormous intellectual advantage gives it the power to do so. For example, we could mistakenly elevate a subgoal to the status of a supergoal. We tell it to solve a mathematical problem, and it complies by turning all the matter in the solar system into a giant calculating device, in the process killing the person who asked the question.}}

According to [[Eliezer Yudkowsky]], a significant problem in AI safety is that unfriendly artificial intelligence is likely to be much easier to create than friendly AI. While both require large advances in recursive optimisation process design, friendly AI also requires the ability to make goal structures invariant under self-improvement (or the AI could transform itself into something unfriendly) and a goal structure that aligns with human values and does not automatically destroy the human race. An unfriendly AI, on the other hand, can optimize for an arbitrary goal structure, which does not need to be invariant under self-modification.<ref name="singinst12">[http://singinst.org/upload/CEV.html Coherent Extrapolated Volition, Eliezer S.

[[File:Biological vs. digital information.jpg|thumb|Amount of digital information worldwide (5{{e|21}} bytes) versus human genome information worldwide (10<sup>19</sup> bytes) in 2014<ref name="InfoBiosphere2016" />]]
While the technological singularity is usually seen as a sudden event, some scholars argue the current speed of change already fits this description.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

In addition, some argue that we are already in the midst of a [[The Major Transitions in Evolution|major evolutionary transition]] that merges technology, biology, and society. Digital technology has infiltrated the fabric of human society to a degree of indisputable and often life-sustaining dependence.

A 2016 article in ''[[Trends in Ecology & Evolution]]'' argues that "humans already embrace fusions of biology and technology. We spend most of our waking time communicating through digitally mediated channels... we trust [[artificial intelligence]] with our lives through [[Anti-lock braking system|antilock braking in cars]] and [[autopilot]]s in planes... With one in three courtships leading to marriages in America beginning online, digital algorithms are also taking a role in human pair bonding and reproduction".

The article further argues that from the perspective of the [[evolution]], several previous [[The Major Transitions in Evolution|Major Transitions in Evolution]] have transformed life through innovations in information storage and replication ([[RNA]], [[DNA]], [[multicellularity]], and [[culture]] and [[language]]). In the current stage of life's evolution, the carbon-based biosphere has generated a [[cognitive system]] (humans) capable of creating technology that will result in a comparable [[The Major Transitions in Evolution|evolutionary transition]].

The digital information created by humans has reached a similar magnitude to biological information in the biosphere. Since the 1980s, the quantity of digital information stored has doubled about every 2.5 years, reaching about 5 [[zettabyte]]s in 2014 (5{{e|21}} bytes).<ref>{{cite web |author=Hilbert |first=Martin |title=Information Quantity |url=http://www.martinhilbert.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Hilbert2017_ReferenceWorkEntry_InformationQuantity.pdf}}</ref>

In biological terms, there are 7.2&nbsp;billion humans on the planet, each having a genome of 6.2&nbsp;billion nucleotides. Since one byte can encode four nucleotide pairs, the individual genomes of every human on the planet could be encoded by approximately 1{{e|19}} bytes. The digital realm stored 500 times more information than this in 2014 (see figure). The total amount of DNA contained in all of the cells on Earth is estimated to be about 5.3{{e|37}} base pairs, equivalent to 1.325{{e|37}} bytes of information.

If growth in digital storage continues at its current rate of 30–38% compound annual growth per year,<ref name="HilbertLopez2011" /> it will rival the total information content contained in all of the DNA in all of the cells on Earth in about 110 years. This would represent a doubling of the amount of information stored in the biosphere across a total time period of just 150 years".<ref name="InfoBiosphere2016">{{Cite journal|url=http://escholarship.org/uc/item/38f4b791|doi=10.1016/j.tree.2015.12.013|pmid=26777788|title=Information in the Biosphere: Biological and Digital Worlds|journal=Trends in Ecology & Evolution|volume=31|issue=3|pages=180–189|year=2016|last1=Kemp|first1=D.

===Implications for human society===
{{further|Artificial intelligence in fiction}}
In February 2009, under the auspices of the [[Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence]] (AAAI), [[Eric Horvitz]] chaired a meeting of leading computer scientists, artificial intelligence researchers and roboticists at the Asilomar conference center in Pacific Grove, California. The goal was to discuss the potential impact of the hypothetical possibility that robots could become self-sufficient and able to make their own decisions. They discussed the extent to which computers and robots might be able to acquire [[autonomy]], and to what degree they could use such abilities to pose threats or hazards.<ref name="nytimes july09" />

Some machines are programmed with various forms of semi-autonomy, including the ability to locate their own power sources and choose targets to attack with weapons. Also, some [[computer virus]]es can evade elimination and, according to scientists in attendance, could therefore be said to have reached a "cockroach" stage of machine intelligence. The conference attendees noted that self-awareness as depicted in science-fiction is probably unlikely, but that other potential hazards and pitfalls exist.<ref name="nytimes july09">{{cite news|last=Markoff|first=John|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/26/science/26robot.html?_r=1&ref=todayspaper|title=Scientists Worry Machines May Outsmart Man|work=The New York Times|date=26 July 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170701084625/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/26/science/26robot.html?_r=1&ref=todayspaper|archive-date=2017-07-01}}</ref>

Frank S. Robinson predicts that once humans achieve a machine with the intelligence of a human, scientific and technological problems will be tackled and solved with brainpower far superior to that of humans. He notes that artificial systems are able to share data more directly than humans, and predicts that this would result in a global network of super-intelligence that would dwarf human capability.<ref name=":0">{{cite magazine |last=Robinson |first=Frank S. |title=The Human Future: Upgrade or Replacement? |magazine=[[The Humanist]] |date=27 June 2013 |url=https://thehumanist.com/magazine/july-august-2013/features/the-human-future-upgrade-or-replacement |access-date=1 May 2020 |archive-date=15 February 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210215095131/https://thehumanist.com/magazine/july-august-2013/features/the-human-future-upgrade-or-replacement |url-status=live }}</ref> Robinson also discusses how vastly different the future would potentially look after such an intelligence explosion.

==Hard vs. soft takeoff==
[[File:Recursive self-improvement.svg|thumb|upright=1.6|In this sample recursive self-improvement scenario, humans modifying an AI's architecture would be able to double its performance every three years through, for example, 30 generations before exhausting all feasible improvements (left). If instead the AI is smart enough to modify its own architecture as well as human researchers can, its time required to complete a redesign halves with each generation, and it progresses all 30 feasible generations in six years (right).<ref name="yudkowsky-global-risk">[[Eliezer Yudkowsky]]. "Artificial intelligence as a positive and negative factor in global risk." Global catastrophic risks (2008).</ref>]]

In a hard takeoff scenario, an artificial superintelligence rapidly self-improves, "taking control" of the world (perhaps in a matter of hours), too quickly for significant human-initiated error correction or for a gradual tuning of the agent's goals. In a soft takeoff scenario, the AI still becomes far more powerful than humanity, but at a human-like pace (perhaps on the order of decades), on a timescale where ongoing human interaction and correction can effectively steer the AI's development.<ref>Bugaj, Stephan Vladimir, and Ben Goertzel. "Five ethical imperatives and their implications for human-AGI interaction." Dynamical Psychology (2007).</ref><ref>Sotala, Kaj, and Roman V. Yampolskiy. "Responses to catastrophic AGI risk: a survey." Physica Scripta 90.1 (2014): 018001.</ref>

[[Ramez Naam]] argues against a hard takeoff. He has pointed out that we already see recursive self-improvement by superintelligences, such as corporations. [[Intel]], for example, has "the collective brainpower of tens of thousands of humans and probably millions of CPU cores to... design better CPUs!" However, this has not led to a hard takeoff; rather, it has led to a soft takeoff in the form of [[Moore's law]].<ref name=Naam2014Further>{{cite web|last=Naam|first=Ramez|title=The Singularity Is Further Than It Appears|url=http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2014/02/the-singularity-is-further-tha.html|access-date=16 May 2014|year=2014|archive-date=17 May 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140517114905/http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2014/02/the-singularity-is-further-tha.html|url-status=live}}</ref> Naam further points out that the computational complexity of higher intelligence may be much greater than linear, such that "creating a mind of intelligence 2 is probably ''more'' than twice as hard as creating a mind of intelligence 1."<ref name="Naam2014Ascend">{{cite web |last=Naam |first=Ramez |year=2014 |title=Why AIs Won't Ascend in the Blink of an Eye – Some Math |url=http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2014/02/why-ais-wont-ascend-in-blink-of-an-eye.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140517115830/http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2014/02/why-ais-wont-ascend-in-blink-of-an-eye.html |archive-date=17 May 2014 |access-date=16 May 2014}}</ref>

[[J. Storrs Hall]] believes that "many of the more commonly seen scenarios for overnight hard takeoff are circular – they seem to assume hyperhuman capabilities at the ''starting point'' of the self-improvement process" in order for an AI to be able to make the dramatic, domain-general improvements required for takeoff. Hall suggests that rather than recursively self-improving its hardware, software, and infrastructure all on its own, a fledgling AI would be better off specializing in one area where it was most effective and then buying the remaining components on the marketplace, because the quality of products on the marketplace continually improves, and the AI would have a hard time keeping up with the cutting-edge technology used by the rest of the world.<ref name=Hall2008>{{cite journal|last=Hall|first=J. Storrs|title=Engineering Utopia|journal=Artificial General Intelligence, 2008: Proceedings of the First AGI Conference|date=2008|pages=460–467|url=http://www.agiri.org/takeoff_hall.pdf|access-date=16 May 2014|archive-date=1 December 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141201201504/http://www.agiri.org/takeoff_hall.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref>

[[Ben Goertzel]] agrees with Hall's suggestion that a new human-level AI would do well to use its intelligence to accumulate wealth. The AI's talents might inspire companies and governments to disperse its software throughout society. Goertzel is skeptical of a hard five minute takeoff but speculates that a takeoff from human to superhuman level on the order of five years is reasonable. Goerzel refers to this scenario as a "semihard takeoff".<ref name="Goertzel2014">{{cite news|last1=Goertzel|first1=Ben|title=Superintelligence — Semi-hard Takeoff Scenarios|url=http://hplusmagazine.com/2014/09/26/superintelligence-semi-hard-takeoff-scenarios/|access-date=25 October 2014|agency=h+ Magazine|date=26 Sep 2014|archive-date=25 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141025053847/http://hplusmagazine.com/2014/09/26/superintelligence-semi-hard-takeoff-scenarios/|url-status=live}}</ref>

[[Max More]] disagrees, arguing that if there were only a few superfast human-level AIs, that they would not radically change the world, as they would still depend on other people to get things done and would still have human cognitive constraints. Even if all superfast AIs worked on intelligence augmentation, it is unclear why they would do better in a discontinuous way than existing human cognitive scientists at producing super-human intelligence, although the rate of progress would increase. More further argues that a superintelligence would not transform the world overnight: a superintelligence would need to engage with existing, slow human systems to accomplish physical impacts on the world. "The need for collaboration, for organization, and for putting ideas into physical changes will ensure that all the old rules are not thrown out overnight or even within years."<ref name=More>{{cite web|last1=More|first1=Max|title=Singularity Meets Economy|url=http://hanson.gmu.edu/vc.html#more|access-date=10 November 2014|archive-date=28 August 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090828023928/http://hanson.gmu.edu/vc.html#more|url-status=live}}</ref>

== Relation to immortality and aging ==
[[K. Eric Drexler|Drexler]] (1986), one of the founders of [[nanotechnology]], postulates cell repair devices, including ones operating within cells and using as yet hypothetical [[biological machine]]s.<ref name="drexler1986"/> According to [[Richard Feynman]], it was his former graduate student and collaborator [[Albert Hibbs]] who originally suggested to him (circa 1959) the idea of a ''medical'' use for Feynman's theoretical micromachines. Hibbs suggested that certain repair machines might one day be reduced in size to the point that it would, in theory, be possible to (as Feynman put it) "[[Molecular machine#Biological|swallow the doctor]]". The idea was incorporated into Feynman's 1959 essay ''[[There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom]].''<ref name="feynman1959">{{cite web|url = http://www.its.caltech.edu/~feynman/plenty.html|title = There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom|first = Richard P.|last = Feynman |author-link = Richard Feynman|date = December 1959|url-status = dead|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100211190050/http://www.its.caltech.edu/~feynman/plenty.html|archive-date = 2010-02-11}}</ref>

[[Hans Moravec|Moravec]] (1988)<ref name="moravec1988"/> predicts the possibility of "uploading" human mind into a human-like robot, achieving quasi-immortality by extreme longevity via transfer of the human mind between successive new robots as the old ones wear out; beyond that, he predicts later exponential acceleration of subjective experience of time leading to a subjective sense of immortality.

[[Ray Kurzweil|Kurzweil]] (2005) suggests that medical advances would allow people to protect their bodies from the effects of aging, making the [[Life extension|life expectancy limitless]]. Kurzweil argues that the technological advances in medicine would allow us to continuously repair and replace defective components in our bodies, prolonging life to an undetermined age.<ref name="kurzweil2005-215"/> Kurzweil further buttresses his argument by discussing current bio-engineering advances. Kurzweil suggests [[somatic gene therapy]]; after synthetic viruses with specific genetic information, the next step would be to apply this technology to gene therapy, replacing human DNA with synthesized genes.<ref>''The Singularity Is Near'', p.&nbsp;216.</ref>

Beyond merely extending the operational life of the physical body, [[Jaron Lanier]] argues for a form of immortality called "Digital Ascension" that involves "people dying in the flesh and being uploaded into a computer and remaining conscious."<ref>{{cite book |last=Lanier |first=Jaron |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780307269645 |title=You Are Not a Gadget: A Manifesto |publisher=[[Alfred A.

==History of the concept==
A paper by Mahendra Prasad, published in ''[[AI Magazine]]'', asserts that the 18th-century mathematician [[Marquis de Condorcet]] was the first person to hypothesize and mathematically model an intelligence explosion and its effects on humanity.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Prasad|first=Mahendra|year=2019|title=Nicolas de Condorcet and the First Intelligence Explosion Hypothesis|journal=AI Magazine|volume=40|issue=1|pages=29–33|doi=10.1609/aimag.v40i1.2855|doi-access=free}}</ref>

An early description of the idea was made in [[John W. Campbell]]'s 1932 short story "The last evolution".

In his 1958 obituary for [[John von Neumann]], Ulam recalled a conversation with von Neumann about the "ever accelerating progress of technology and changes in the mode of human life, which gives the appearance of approaching some essential singularity in the history of the race beyond which human affairs, as we know them, could not continue."<ref name="ulam1958"/>

In 1965, Good wrote his essay postulating an "intelligence explosion" of recursive self-improvement of a machine intelligence.<ref name="good1965"/><ref name="good1965-stat"/>

In 1977, [[Hans Moravec]] wrote an article with unclear publishing status where he envisioned a development of self-improving thinking machines, a creation of "super-consciousness, the synthesis of terrestrial life, and perhaps jovian and martian life as well, constantly improving and extending itself, spreading outwards from the solar system, converting non-life into mind."<ref>[https://frc.ri.cmu.edu/~hpm/project.archive/general.articles/1977/smart Intelligent machines: How to get there from here and What to do afterwards] by Hans Moravec, 1977 ([[Wikidata:Q115765098|wikidata]])</ref><ref name="smart1999"/> The article describes the human mind uploading later covered in Moravec (1988). The machines are expected to reach human level and then improve themselves beyond that ("Most significantly of all, they [the machines] can be put to work as programmers and engineers, with the task of optimizing the software and hardware which make them what they are. The successive generations of machines produced this way will be increasingly smarter and more cost effective.") Humans will no longer be needed, and their abilities will be overtaken by the machines: "In the long run the sheer physical inability of humans to keep up with these rapidly evolving progeny of our minds will ensure that the ratio of people to machines approaches zero, and that a direct descendant of our culture, but not our genes, inherits the universe." While the word "singularity" is not used, the notion of human-level thinking machines thereafter improving themselves beyond human level is there. In this view, there is no intelligence explosion in the sense of a very rapid intelligence increase once human equivalence is reached. An updated version of the article was published in 1979 in [[Analog Science Fiction and Fact]].<ref>[https://www.frc.ri.cmu.edu/~hpm/project.archive/general.articles/1978/analog.1978.html Today's Computers, Intelligent Machines and Our Future] by Hans Moravec, 1979, [[wikidata:Q115765733|wikidata]]</ref><ref name="smart1999"/>

In 1981, [[Stanisław Lem]] published his [[science fiction]] novel ''[[Golem XIV]]''. It describes a military AI computer (Golem XIV) who obtains consciousness and starts to increase his own intelligence, moving towards personal technological singularity. Golem XIV was originally created to aid its builders in fighting wars, but as its intelligence advances to a much higher level than that of humans, it stops being interested in the military requirements because it finds them lacking internal logical consistency.

In 1983, [[Vernor Vinge]] addressed Good's intelligence explosion in print in the January 1983 issue of ''[[Omni (magazine)|Omni]]'' magazine. In this op-ed piece, Vinge seems to have been the first to use the term "singularity" (although not "technological singularity") in a way that was specifically tied to the creation of intelligent machines:<ref name="dooling2008-88"/><ref name="smart1999"/>
{{blockquote|We will soon create intelligences greater than our own. When this happens, human history will have reached a kind of singularity, an intellectual transition as impenetrable as the knotted space-time at the center of a black hole, and the world will pass far beyond our understanding. This singularity, I believe, already haunts a number of science-fiction writers. It makes realistic extrapolation to an interstellar future impossible. To write a story set more than a century hence, one needs a nuclear war in between ... so that the world remains intelligible.}}

In 1985, in "The Time Scale of Artificial Intelligence", artificial intelligence researcher [[Ray Solomonoff]] articulated mathematically the related notion of what he called an "infinity point": if a research community of human-level self-improving AIs take four years to double their own speed, then two years, then one year and so on, their capabilities increase infinitely in finite time.<ref name="chalmers2010" /><ref name="solomonoff1985"/>

In 1986, Vernor Vinge published ''[[Marooned in Realtime]]'', a science-fiction novel where a few remaining humans traveling forward in the future have survived an unknown extinction event that might well be a singularity. In a short afterword, the author states that an actual technological singularity would not be the end of the human species: "of course it seems very unlikely that the Singularity would be a clean vanishing of the human race. (On the other hand, such a vanishing is the timelike analog of the silence we find all across the sky.)".<ref>{{Cite book |last=Vinge |first=Vernor |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H1NOwjENGOkC&dq=%22Singularity%22&pg=PA271 |title=Marooned in Realtime |date=2004-10-01 |publisher=Macmillan |isbn=978-1-4299-1512-0 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine

In 1988, Vinge used the phrase "technological singularity" (including "technological") in the short story collection ''Threats and Other Promises'', writing in the introduction to his story "The Whirligig of Time" (p.&nbsp;72): ''Barring a worldwide catastrophe, I believe that technology will achieve our wildest dreams, and'' soon. ''When we raise our own intelligence and that of our creations, we are no longer in a world of human-sized characters.

In 1988, [[Hans Moravec]] published ''Mind Children'',<ref name="moravec1988"/> in which he predicted human-level intelligence in supercomputers by 2010, self-improving intelligent machines far surpassing human intelligence later, human mind uploading into human-like robots later, intelligent machines leaving humans behind, and space colonization. He did not mention "singularity", though, and he did not speak of a rapid explosion of intelligence immediately after the human level is achieved. Nonetheless, the overall singularity tenor is there in predicting both human-level artificial intelligence and further artificial intelligence far surpassing humans later.

Vinge's 1993 article "The Coming Technological Singularity: How to Survive in the Post-Human Era",<ref name="vinge1993" /> spread widely on the internet and helped to popularize the idea.<ref name="dooling2008-89"/> This article contains the statement, "Within thirty years, we will have the technological means to create superhuman intelligence. Shortly after, the human era will be ended." Vinge argues that science-fiction authors cannot write realistic post-singularity characters who surpass the human intellect, as the thoughts of such an intellect would be beyond the ability of humans to express.<ref name="vinge1993" />

[[Marvin Minsky|Minsky]]'s 1994 article says robots will "inherit the Earth", possibly with the use of nanotechnology, and proposes to think of robots as human "mind children", drawing the analogy from Moravec. The rhetorical effect of that analogy is that if humans are fine to pass the world to their biological children, they should be equally fine to pass it to robots, their "mind" children. As per Minsky, 'we could design our "mind-children" to think a million times faster than we do. To such a being, half a minute might seem as long as one of our years, and each hour as long as an entire human lifetime.' The feature of the singularity present in Minsky is the development of superhuman artificial intelligence ("million times faster"), but there is no talk of sudden intelligence explosion, self-improving thinking machines or unpredictability beyond any specific event and the word "singularity" is not used.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Will Robots Inherit the Earth? |url=https://web.media.mit.edu/~minsky/papers/sciam.inherit.html |access-date=2023-06-14 |website=web.media.mit.edu}}</ref>

[[Frank J. Tipler|Tipler]]'s 1994 book ''[[The Physics of Immortality (book)|The Physics of Immortality]]'' predicts a future where super–intelligent machines will build enormously powerful computers, people will be "emulated" in computers, life will reach every galaxy and people will achieve immortality when they reach [[Omega Point]].<ref>[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226020169_Colonizing_the_Galaxies ''Colonizing the Galaxies''] by Graham Oppy</ref> There is no talk of Vingean "singularity" or sudden intelligence explosion, but intelligence much greater than human is there, as well as immortality.

In 1996, [[Yudkowsky]] predicted a singularity by 2021.<ref name="yudkowsky1996"/> His version of singularity involves intelligence explosion: once AIs are doing the research to improve themselves, speed doubles after 2 years, then 1 one year, then after 6 months, then after 3 months, then after 1.5 months, and after more iterations, the "singularity" is reached.<ref name="yudkowsky1996"/> This construction implies that the speed reaches infinity in finite time.

In 2000, [[Bill Joy]], a prominent technologist and a co-founder of [[Sun Microsystems]], voiced concern over the potential dangers of robotics, genetic engineering, and nanotechnology.<ref name="Joy2000"/>

In 2005, Kurzweil published ''[[The Singularity Is Near]]''. Kurzweil's publicity campaign included an appearance on ''[[The Daily Show with Jon Stewart]]''.<ref name="episode2006"/>

From 2006 to 2012, an annual [[Singularity Summit]] conference was organized by [[Machine Intelligence Research Institute]], founded by [[Eliezer Yudkowsky]].

In 2007, Yudkowsky suggested that many of the varied definitions that have been assigned to "singularity" are mutually incompatible rather than mutually supporting.<ref name="yudkowsky2007"/><ref>Sandberg, Anders. "An overview of models of technological singularity." Roadmaps to AGI and the Future of AGI Workshop, Lugano, Switzerland, March. Vol. 8. 2010.</ref> For example, Kurzweil extrapolates current technological trajectories past the arrival of self-improving AI or superhuman intelligence, which Yudkowsky argues represents a tension with both I. J. Good's proposed discontinuous upswing in intelligence and Vinge's thesis on unpredictability.<ref name="yudkowsky2007"/>

In 2009, Kurzweil and [[X-Prize]] founder [[Peter Diamandis]] announced the establishment of [[Singularity University]], a nonaccredited private institute whose stated mission is "to educate, inspire and empower leaders to apply exponential technologies to address humanity's grand challenges."<ref name="singularityu"/> Funded by [[Google]], [[Autodesk]], [[ePlanet Ventures]], and a group of [[High tech|technology industry]] leaders, Singularity University is based at [[NASA]]'s [[Ames Research Center]] in [[Mountain View, California|Mountain View]], [[California]]. The not-for-profit organization runs an annual ten-week graduate program during summer that covers ten different technology and allied tracks, and a series of executive programs throughout the year.

==In politics==
In 2007, the Joint Economic Committee of the [[United States Congress]] released a report about the future of nanotechnology. It predicts significant technological and political changes in the mid-term future, including possible technological singularity.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vyp1AwAAQBAJ&pg=PA375|title=Encyclopedia of Nanoscience and Society|first=David H.|last=Guston|date=14 July 2010|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-1-4522-6617-6|access-date=4 November 2016|archive-date=15 February 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210215095105/https://books.google.com/books?id=vyp1AwAAQBAJ&pg=PA375|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.thenewatlantis.com/docLib/20120213_TheFutureisComingSoonerThanYouThink.pdf | title=Nanotechnology: The Future is Coming Sooner Than You Think | publisher=Joint Economic Committee United States Congress| date=March 2007 | access-date=2012-04-29 | archive-date=2021-02-15 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210215095048/http://www.thenewatlantis.com/wp-content/uploads/legacy-pdfs/20120213_TheFutureisComingSoonerThanYouThink.pdf | url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="treder2007">{{cite web|url=http://crnano.typepad.com/crnblog/2007/03/congress_and_th.html|title=Congress and the Singularity|first=Mike|last=Treder|date=March 31, 2007|access-date=2016-11-04|archive-date=2007-04-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070407031516/https://crnano.typepad.com/crnblog/2007/03/congress_and_th.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

Former President of the United States [[Barack Obama]] spoke about singularity in his interview to ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' in 2016:<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.wired.com/2016/10/president-obama-mit-joi-ito-interview/|title=Barack Obama Talks AI, Robo Cars, and the Future of the World|first=Scott|last=Dadich|magazine=Wired|date=12 October 2016|access-date=4 November 2016|archive-date=3 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171203142607/https://www.wired.com/2016/10/president-obama-mit-joi-ito-interview/|url-status=live}}</ref>
{{Blockquote|text=One thing that we haven't talked about too much, and I just want to go back to, is we really have to think through the economic implications. Because most people aren't spending a lot of time right now worrying about singularity—they are worrying about "Well, is my job going to be replaced by a machine?"}}

"So we will be producing about 10<sup>26</sup> to 10<sup>29</sup> cps of nonbiological computation per year in the early 2030s. This is roughly equal to our estimate for the capacity of all living biological human intelligence ... This state of computation in the early 2030s will not represent the Singularity, however, because it does not yet correspond to a profound expansion of our intelligence. By the mid-2040s, however, that one thousand dollars' worth of computation will be equal to 10<sup>26</sup> cps, so the intelligence created per year (at a total cost of about $10<sup>12</sup>) will be about one billion times more powerful than all human intelligence today. That ''will'' indeed represent a profound change, and it is for that reason that I set the date for the Singularity—representing a profound and disruptive transformation in human capability—as 2045."</ref>

''Multiple'' tests of [[artificial intelligence|artificial-intelligence]] efficacy are needed because, "just as there is no single test of [[Athletics (physical culture)|athletic]] prowess, there cannot be one ultimate test of intelligence." One such test, a "Construction Challenge", would test perception and physical action—"two important elements of intelligent behavior that were entirely absent from the original [[Turing test]]." Another proposal has been to give machines the same standardized tests of science and other disciplines that schoolchildren take. A so far insuperable stumbling block to artificial intelligence is an incapacity for reliable [[disambiguation]]. "[V]irtually every sentence [that people generate] is [[ambiguity|ambiguous]], often in multiple ways." A prominent example is known as the "pronoun disambiguation problem": a machine has no way of determining to whom or what a [[pronoun]] in a sentence—such as "he", "she" or "it"—refers.
