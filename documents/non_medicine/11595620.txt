The '''''Spring and Autumn Annals of the Sixteen Kingdoms''''', also known by its Chinese title '''''Shiliuguo Chunqiu''''' ({{zh|t=十六國春秋|s=十六国春秋|p=Shíliùguó Chūnqiū|w=Shihliukuo Ch'unch'iu}}) is a Chinese biographical historical work of the [[Sixteen Kingdoms]] compiled by the [[Northern Wei]] official [[Cui Hong]] between 501 and 522. It became one of the chief sources for the compilation of the ''[[Book of Wei]]'' and ''[[Book of Jin]]''.

Parts of the book went missing from the early [[Tang dynasty]] and did not survive intact. It originally contained 100 volumes, a preface and a chronological table. By the time of the early [[Song dynasty]], many of them were lost and only about 20 volumes remained, which were quoted extensively by [[Sima Guang]]. There are two extant versions dating from the late [[Ming dynasty]], the edition by Tu Qiaosun containing 100 volumes, and the one by He Tang containing 16 volumes, reprinted in the ''Hanwei Congshu'', a compilation of histories. Tu's edition was published for the third time in 1781. Also there is a 100 volumes edition together with a chronological table from the mid-[[Qing dynasty]] by Tang Qiu, taken from the edition by He Tang and from other materials.
