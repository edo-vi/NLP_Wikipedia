The '''conte cruel''' is, as ''The A to Z of Fantasy Literature'' by [[Brian Stableford]] states, a "short-story genre that takes its name from an 1883 collection by [[Auguste Villiers de l'Isle-Adam|Villiers de l'Isle-Adam]]", although previous examples had been provided by such writers as [[Edgar Allan Poe]]. Some critics use the label to refer only to non-supernatural horror stories, especially those that have nasty climactic twists, but it is applicable to any story whose conclusion exploits the cruel aspects of the 'irony of fate.'<ref name="Stableford2009">{{cite book|author=Brian Stableford|title=The A to Z of Fantasy Literature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UHc3XTdJBxQC&pg=PA85|date=13 August 2009|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-6345-3|pages=85–}}</ref> The collection from which the short-story genre of the conte cruel takes its name is ''Contes cruels'' (1883, tr. Sardonic Tales, 1927) by [[Auguste Villiers de l'Isle-Adam|Villiers de l'Isle-Adam]]. Also taking its name from this collection is ''[[Contes cruels (Mirbeau)|Contes cruels]]'' ("''Cruel Tales''"), a two-volume set of about 150 tales and short stories by the 19th-century French writer [[Octave Mirbeau]], collected and edited by [[Pierre Michel]] and Jean-François Nivet and published in two volumes in 1990 by Librairie Séguier. 

Some noted writers in the conte cruel genre are [[Charles Birkin]], [[Maurice Level]], [[Patricia Highsmith]]<ref>François Riviere,

Retrieved 13 January 2018.</ref> and [[Roald Dahl]], the latter of whom originated ''[[Tales of the Unexpected (book)|Tales of the Unexpected]]''. [[H. P. Lovecraft]] observed of Level's fiction in his essay ''Supernatural Horror in Literature'' (1927): "This type, however, is less a part of the weird tradition than a class peculiar to itself—the so-called conte cruel, in which the wrenching of the emotions is accomplished through dramatic tantalizations, frustrations, and gruesome physical horrors".<ref name="Lovecraft1964">{{cite book|author=Howard Phillips Lovecraft|title=At the Mountains of Madness|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CuWNI905KjIC&pg=PT188|year=1964|publisher=eBookIt.com|isbn=978-9949-9424-4-2|pages=188–}}</ref>

[[Brian M. Stableford]] has observed that, by the 1980s, the conte cruel was the standard narrative form of [[soft science fiction]],<ref name="Stableford2004">{{cite book|author=Brian M.
