{{Short description|A disorder of the nose of horses}}
'''Equine nasal cysts''' are abnormal fluid filled sacs which occur inside the nasal sinuses of horses. The cysts are lined with [[epithelium]], and usually occur in the [[ventral concha]]e or [[maxillary sinus]]es,<ref name="Merck" /> most commonly in horses less than one year old.<ref name="rush 2008">{{cite book |last1=Rush |first1=Bonnie |last2=Mair |first2=Tim |title=Equine Respiratory Diseases |date=2008 |publisher=Blackwell Science |isbn=9781405155311 |pages=48â€“49 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pp4B5hJ-b5MC |chapter=Paranasal sinus cysts}}</ref>  Surgical removal of the cyst has a good prognosis for the horse.

==Characteristics==
The most common sign of a nasal cyst is facial swelling, with obstruction of the nasal passage.<ref name="Mair" /> Sometimes, a mucoid nasal discharge occurs, which is caused by obstruction to [[mucociliary clearance]],<ref name="Mair" /> and therefore does not resolve following antibiotic treatment.<ref name="Wilson">{{cite book |last1=Wilson |first1=David |title=Clinical veterinary advisor. The horse |date=2010 |publisher=Elsevier Saunders |isbn=9781437714494 |page=527 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZZs_WBKZ-PwC |chapter=Sinonasal cysts}}</ref> If the cyst is located in the caudal maxillary sinus, it may cause the eyeball on the affected side to bulge out of the orbit, known as [[exophthalmos]].<ref name="Dwyer" />

==Diagnosis==
[[X-ray|Radiographs]] generally provide better results than [[Endoscope|endoscopic]] examination when diagnosing these problems; multiloculated densities and fluid lines show up more readily in the sinuses, occasionally with dental displacement and also dental and jaw line distortion, flattened roots in the teeth, mineralization and soft tissue calcification, and major deviation of the [[septum]] and [[vomer]] bones.{{cn|date=October 2019}}

==Treatment==
Cysts are removed by surgery, which may be performed with the horse standing and sedated, or under general anesthesia.<ref name="Mair">{{cite book |last1=Lane |first1=J. Geoffrey |editor1-last=Mair |editor1-first=Tim |editor2-last=Love |editor2-first=Sandy |editor3-last=Schumacher |editor3-first=James |editor4-last=Smith |editor4-first=Roger K.W. |editor5-last=Frazer |editor5-first=Grant |title=Equine medicine, surgery and reproduction |publisher=Elsevier |isbn=9780702052026 |page=89 |edition=2nd |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ufp7Xdcw5v0C |chapter=Disorders of the ear, nose and throat|date=23 January 2013 }}</ref> Treatment involves surgical removal of the cyst and any of the involved lining of the concha.

==Prognosis==
The prognosis for a complete recovery is good, and the rate of any recurrence is minimal.<ref name="Dwyer">{{cite book |last1=Dwyer |first1=Ann E. |editor1-last=Gilger |editor1-first=Brian C. |title=Equine Ophthalmology |edition=3rd|date=2016 |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |isbn=9781119047858 |page=175 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o91rDQAAQBAJ |chapter=Practical field ophthalmology}}</ref> Some horses may have a mild mucous discharge after surgery, which can be permanent.<ref name="Merck" />

==Epidemiology==
Most nasal cysts are identified in horses younger than one year old, but can also be diagnosed in horses over 9 years of age.<ref name=Merck>{{cite web |first=Bonnie R.|last=Rush| title = Sinus cysts | work = The Merck Veterinary Manual | year = 2019 | url = https://www.merckvetmanual.com/respiratory-system/respiratory-diseases-of-horses/diseases-of-the-paranasal-sinuses-in-horses#v3294263 | accessdate = 2019-10-26 }}</ref> There is no known breed or sex predisposition for nasal cysts.<ref name="Wilson" />
