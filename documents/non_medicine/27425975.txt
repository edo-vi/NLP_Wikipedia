'''Polarized light microscopy''' can mean any of a number of [[optical microscopy]] techniques involving [[polarized light]]. Simple techniques include illumination of the sample with polarized light. Directly transmitted light can, optionally, be blocked with a polariser orientated at 90 degrees to the illumination. More complex microscopy techniques which take advantage of polarized light include [[differential interference contrast microscopy]] and [[interference reflection microscopy]]. Scientists will often use a device called a polarizing plate to convert natural light into polarized light.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://research.physics.berkeley.edu/yildiz/Teaching/PHYS250/Lecture_PDFs/polarization%20microscopy.pdf |title=Basics of Polarizing Microscopy |publisher=Olympus |access-date=15 December 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161215160659/http://research.physics.berkeley.edu/yildiz/Teaching/PHYS250/Lecture_PDFs/polarization%20microscopy.pdf |archive-date=15 December 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref>

These illumination techniques are most commonly used on [[birefringent]] samples where the polarized light interacts strongly with the sample and so generating contrast with the background. Polarized light microscopy is used extensively in [[optical mineralogy]].

Although the invention of the polarizing microscope is typically attributed to [[David Brewster]] around 1815, Brewster clearly acknowledges the priority of [[Henry Fox Talbot]], who published his work in 1834.<ref>{{cite book|author=David Brewster|title=A Treatise on the Microscope|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B1yTnAEACAAJ|access-date=4 January 2021|year=2021|publisher=Thomas Allan}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal| author = William Henry Fox Talbot | title = XLIV.
