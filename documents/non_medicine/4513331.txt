== Early life and education ==
Floridi was born in [[Rome]] in 1964, and studied at Rome University [[La Sapienza]] ([[laurea]], first class with distinction, 1988), where he was originally educated as a [[history of philosophy|historian of philosophy]].<ref name="philosophyofinformation.net">{{cite web |url=http://www.philosophyofinformation.net/pdf/auto.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2008-09-07 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907203824/http://www.philosophyofinformation.net/pdf/auto.pdf |archive-date=7 September 2008 |df=dmy-all }} Biography, in Italian, from ''Cervelli in Fuga'' (Roma: Accenti, 2001)</ref> He soon became interested in [[analytic philosophy]] and wrote his ''tesi di laurea'' (roughly equivalent to an [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] thesis) in [[philosophy of logic]], on [[Michael Dummett]]'s [[anti-realism]]. He obtained his [[Master of Philosophy]] (1989) and [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] degree (1990) from the [[University of Warwick]], working in [[epistemology]] and [[philosophy of logic]] with [[Susan Haack]] (who was his PhD supervisor) and [[Michael Dummett]]. Floridi's early student years are partly recounted in the non-fiction book ''[[The Lost Painting: The Quest for a Caravaggio Masterpiece]]'', where he is "Luciano". During his graduate and [[postdoctoral]] years, he covered the standard topics in [[analytic philosophy]] in search of a new methodology. He sought to approach contemporary problems from a heuristically powerful and intellectually enriching perspective when dealing with lively philosophical issues. During his graduate studies, he began to distance himself from classical [[analytic philosophy]]. In his view, the analytic movement had lost its way.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uwm.edu/Dept/SOIS/cipr/floridi_inseit_interview.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705165117/http://www.uwm.edu/Dept/SOIS/cipr/floridi_inseit_interview.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=5 July 2008|title=INSEIT MEMBER SPOTLIGHT: LUCIANO FLORIDI|date=5 July 2008}}</ref> For this reason, he worked on [[pragmatism]] (especially [[Charles Sanders Peirce|Peirce]]) and [[Foundationalism|foundationalist]] issues in epistemology and [[philosophy of logic]], as well as the history of [[Philosophical skepticism|scepticism]].

== Academic career and previous positions ==
Floridi started his academic career as a lecturer in philosophy at the [[University of Warwick]] in 1990–1991. He joined the Faculty of Philosophy of the [[University of Oxford]] in 1990 and the [[OUCL]] (Oxford's Department of Computer Science) in 1999.

Between 2001 and 2006, he was [[Markle Foundation]] Senior Research Fellow in Information Policy at the [[Programme in Comparative Media Law and Policy]], [[Oxford University]].

Floridi's work focuses on the philosophical, ethical, social, and political implications of the increasing role that information and communication technologies play in our lives. He is particularly concerned with the increasing digitization of our world, the conceptual and ethical implications of the changing relationship between humans and technology, and the need for a new philosophical framework to accommodate these changes.

He argues that we need to develop a new ethical approach to understand and shape the changes brought about by the information revolution, and that the latest developments in technology and science must inform this approach. He has been instrumental in promoting the development of digital ethics, interacting with governments and companies worldwide.

One of Floridi's key contributions is his formulation of the 'Philosophy of Information' (PoI).<ref>{{Cite web |title=Putting Information First: Luciano Floridi and the Philosophy of Information {{!}} Wiley |url=https://www.wiley.com/en-gb/Putting+Information+First%3A+Luciano+Floridi+and+the+Philosophy+of+Information-p-9781444396829 |access-date=2023-02-13 |website=Wiley.com |language=en-gb}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Information |url=https://www.mdpi.com/journal/information/special_issues/philosophy-information |access-date=2023-02-13 |website=www.mdpi.com |language=en}}</ref> The PoI provides a framework for understanding the nature of information and its role in the world. According to Floridi, information is a vital resource that shapes our knowledge and understanding of the world. It is not simply a neutral representation of reality but a part of the world, with its own properties, effects, and moral implications.

Floridi's PoI has several key components<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Gorichanaz |first1=Tim |last2=Furner |first2=Jonathan |last3=Ma |first3=Lai |last4=Bawden |first4=David |last5=Robinson |first5=Lyn |last6=Dixon |first6=Dominic |last7=Herold |first7=Ken |last8=Søe |first8=Sille Obelitz |last9=Van der Veer Martens |first9=Betsy |last10=Floridi |first10=Luciano |date=2020-01-01 |title=Information and design: book symposium on Luciano Floridi's The Logic of Information |journal=Journal of Documentation |volume=76 |issue=2 |pages=586–616 |doi=10.1108/JD-10-2019-0200 |s2cid=210542366 |issn=0022-0418|doi-access=free }}</ref> including an 'ontology of information', which defines the nature of information, an 'ethics of information', which provides a framework for evaluating the moral implications of information and information technologies, an 'epistemology of information', that analyses the role of information in the development of knowledge and science, and a 'logic of information', the concentrates on the more formal aspects. The PoI also includes a theory of the 'information environment', the infosphere, which encompasses the physical, social, and cultural contexts in which information is produced, used, and communicated.

Floridi's work has profoundly impacted the field of digital ethics<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Ess |first=Charles |date=2008-09-01 |title=Luciano Floridi's philosophy of information and information ethics: Critical reflections and the state of the art |url=https://doi.org/10.1007/s10676-008-9172-8 |journal=Ethics and Information Technology |volume=10 |issue=2–3 |pages=89–96 |doi=10.1007/s10676-008-9172-8 |s2cid=21288551 |issn=1388-1957}}</ref> and the philosophy and ethics of AI,<ref>{{Cite news |title=Journal of Experimental & Theoretical Artificial Intelligence |language=en |work=Taylor & Francis |url=https://www.tandfonline.com/toc/teta20/27/1 |access-date=2023-02-13}}</ref> and has helped establish them as distinct and important areas of inquiry.
