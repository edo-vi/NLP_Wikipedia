'''Frosterley Marble''' is a black, [[bitumen|bituminous]] [[coral]]iferous limestone containing fossil [[crinoids]] of the [[Lower Carboniferous]] (Mississippian ), some 325 million years ago.<ref name="ncl-co-curate">{{cite web |url=https://co-curate.ncl.ac.uk/resources/view/44975/ |title=Frosterley Marble (Great Limestone, Mississippian; Rogerley Quarry, England) |publisher=University of Newcastle |access-date=11 October 2023}}</ref><ref name="lawrence">{{cite report |url=https://www.durham.gov.uk/media/3683/County-Durham-Geodiversity-Audit/pdf/CountyDurhamGeodiversityAudit.pdf |title=Durham Geodiversity Audit |last1=Lawrence |first1=D.J.D. |last2=Vye |first2=C.L. |last3=Young |first3=B.|publisher=Durham County Council |year=2004 |access-date=11 October 2023}}</ref>{{rp|40}}  It outcrops in [[Weardale]], [[County Durham]], England, including near the village of [[Frosterley]] whence it is named.

==Geology==
Unlike a true [[marble]], it is not a [[metamorphic rock]], but is so-called because it can take a fine polish. Concentrations of such corals as ''[[Dibunophyllum bipartitum]]'' and of [[brachiopod]] remains contribute to its attractiveness when sections are polished.<ref>Stone et al 2010 ''British Regional Geology: Northern England'' (5th edition) (Keyworth, Nottingham: British Geological Survey) pp238-254</ref><ref name="lawrence" />{{rp|40}}

==Use==
It is cut and polished for use as ornate stone, and was much desired for church decoration, particularly during the Middle Ages.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://weardalemuseum.org.uk/news-frosterley-marble-to-come-to-museum |title=Frosterley Marble Font to Come to the Museum |publisher=Weardale Museum |date=15 April 2020 |access-date=11 October 2023}}</ref> The decorative columns found in [[Durham Cathedral]] date from about 1350.
