'''Thermophyte''' ([[ancient Greek|Greek]] ''thérmos'' = warmth, heat + ''phyton'' = plant)  is an [[organism]] which is tolerant or thriving  at high temperatures. These organisms are categorized according to [[ecological valence]]s at high temperatures, including biological extremely. Such organisms included the hot-spring [[taxon|taxa]] also.<ref name="law">{{cite book|editor= Lawrence E.|year=1999|title=Henderson's Dictionary of biological terms|publisher=Longman Group Ltd.|place= London|isbn=  0-582-22708-9}}</ref><ref name="Međedović">{{cite book|author=Međedović S., Maslić E., Hadžiselimović R.|year=2002|title=Biologija 2. |publisher=Svjetlost, Sarajevo|isbn=9958-10-222-6}}</ref>

A large amount of thermophytes are algae, more specifically blue-green algae, also referred to as cyanobacteria. This type of algae thrives in hot conditions ranging anywhere from 50 to 70 degrees Celsius,<ref>{{Cite web|date=2016-09-16|title=Algae: Definition, Occurrence and Affinities|url=https://www.biologydiscussion.com/algae/algae-definition-occurrence-and-affinities/53530|access-date=2021-12-10|website=Biology Discussion|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Algae|url=http://www.vpscience.org/materials/Algae.pdf}}</ref> which other plants and organisms cannot survive in. Thermophytes are able to survive extreme temperatures as their cells contain an “unorganized nucleus”.

As the name suggests, thermophytes are found in high temperatures. They can be found in abundance in and around places like freshwater hot springs, such as YellowStone National park and in the Lassen Volcanic National park.

There are instances in which a fungus and plant become thermophytes by forming a symbiotic relationship with one another.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Semenkov|first1=I. N.|last2=Klink|first2=G.

Mutualists like the panic grass and its fungal partner cannot survive individually, but thrive when they are in the symbiotic relationship. This means the fungus, plant, and virus function together to survive in such extreme conditions by benefiting from each other. The fungi typically dwells in the intracellular spaces between the plant's cells.{{cn|date=October 2023}}

In a study performed at Washington State, it was discovered that panic grass living near the hot springs in Yellowstone National park thrive due to their relationship with the fungus Curvularia protuberata.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Can a Fungus Save Plants from Global Warming|url=https://www.biointeractive.org/sites/default/files/media/file/2019-08/savedbyfungus-transcript-animatedshort.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Yellowstone plant reveals secret for tolerating high temperatures|url=http://www.montana.edu/news/629/yellowstone-plant-reveals-secret-for-tolerating-high-temperatures|access-date=2021-12-10|website=Montana State University|language=en-US}}</ref> Neither organism can survive on their own at such high temperatures. The mycoviruses infect the fungi that live within these plants and algae. These mycoviruses prevent the fungi from having a pathogenic effect on the plants, thus preventing the fungus from harming the plant.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Jones|first=Susan|date=March 2007|title=Three pieces in the puzzle|journal=Nature Reviews Microbiology|language=en|volume=5|issue=3|pages=169|doi=10.1038/nrmicro1627|s2cid=30520706 |issn=1740-1534|doi-access=free}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Bengyella|first1=Louis|last2=Iftikhar|first2=Sehrish|last3=Nawaz|first3=Kiran|last4=Fonmboh|first4=Dobgima J.|last5=Yekwa|first5=Elsie L.|last6=Jones|first6=Robinson C.|last7=Njanu|first7=Yiboh M.

The study at Washington State has led to the discovery of a way to use these relationships between fungi and plants to make crops more thermo-tolerant, allowing them to resist damage by heat.

The most famous of these ecological groups of organisms are:
*[[Deinococcota]], including ''[[Thermus aquaticus]]'', a species of [[bacteria]].
*''[[Cyanobacteria]]'',  blue-green algae.
*[[Oscillatoria]] terebriformis
*[[Oscillatoria brevis]] 
*Heterohormogonium (motile cell filaments formed by [[cyanobacteria]])
*[[Synechococcus elongatus]]
*[[Scytonema]]
*[[Panicum|Panic grass]] (panic grass with a fungal association with [[Curvularia]])
