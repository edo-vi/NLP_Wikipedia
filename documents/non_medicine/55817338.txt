'''Algorithmic bias''' describes systematic and repeatable [[error]]s in a [[Computer System|computer system]] that create "[[#Defining fairness|unfair]]" outcomes, such as "privileging" one category over another in ways different from the intended function of the algorithm.

For mapping this to ideas in statistical learning, it is ```extremely important``` to note that the "bias" here is typically the ```variance``` in the bias-variance trade off in machine learning. So it is actually the opposite of real machine learning bias. It is variance, the model is over-fitting the data or data generation process. In situations where there was no training data and or no consistent learning, then the "algorithmic bias" is simply a measure of deviation according to some score.

Bias can emerge from many factors, including but not limited to the design of the algorithm or the unintended or unanticipated use or decisions relating to the way data is coded, collected, selected or used to train the algorithm. For example, algorithmic bias has been observed in [[Search engine bias|search engine results]] and [[social media bias|social media platforms]]. This bias can have impacts ranging from inadvertent privacy violations to reinforcing [[Bias|social biases]] of race, gender, sexuality, and ethnicity. The study of algorithmic bias is most concerned with algorithms that reflect "systematic and unfair" discrimination. This bias has only recently been addressed in legal frameworks, such as the European Union's [[General Data Protection Regulation]] (2018) and the proposed [[Artificial Intelligence Act]] (2021).

As algorithms expand their ability to organize society, politics, institutions, and behavior, sociologists have become concerned with the ways in which unanticipated output and manipulation of data can impact the physical world. Because algorithms are often considered to be neutral and unbiased, they can inaccurately project greater authority than human expertise (in part due to the psychological phenomenon of [[automation bias]]), and in some cases, reliance on algorithms can displace human responsibility for their outcomes. Bias can enter into algorithmic systems as a result of pre-existing cultural, social, or institutional expectations; by how features and labels are chosen; because of technical limitations of their design; or by being used in unanticipated contexts or by audiences who are not considered in the software's initial design.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Suresh |first=Harini |last2=Guttag |first2=John |date=2021-11-04 |title=A Framework for Understanding Sources of Harm throughout the Machine Learning Life Cycle |url=https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3465416.3483305 |journal=Proceedings of the 1st ACM Conference on Equity and Access in Algorithms, Mechanisms, and Optimization |series=EAAMO '21 |location=New York, NY, USA |publisher=Association for Computing Machinery |pages=1–9 |doi=10.1145/3465416.3483305 |isbn=978-1-4503-8553-4}}</ref>

Algorithmic bias has been cited in cases ranging from election outcomes to the spread of [[online hate speech]]. It has also arisen in criminal justice, healthcare, and hiring, compounding existing racial, socioeconomic, and gender biases. The relative inability of facial recognition technology to accurately identify darker-skinned faces has been linked to multiple wrongful arrests of black men, an issue stemming from imbalanced datasets. Problems in understanding, researching, and discovering algorithmic bias persist due to the proprietary nature of algorithms, which are typically treated as trade secrets. Even when full transparency is provided, the complexity of certain algorithms poses a barrier to understanding their functioning. Furthermore, algorithms may change, or respond to input or output in ways that cannot be anticipated or easily reproduced for analysis. In many cases, even within a single website or application, there is no single "algorithm" to examine, but a network of many interrelated programs and data inputs, even between users of the same service.

For example, a [[credit score]] algorithm may deny a loan without being unfair, if it is consistently weighing relevant financial criteria. If the algorithm recommends loans to one group of users, but denies loans to another set of nearly identical users based on unrelated criteria, and if this behavior can be repeated across multiple occurrences, an algorithm can be described as ''biased''.<ref name="FriedmanNissenbaum" />{{rp|332}} This bias may be intentional or unintentional (for example, it can come from biased data obtained from a worker that previously did the job the algorithm is going to do from now on).

== Methods ==
Bias can be introduced to an algorithm in several ways. During the assemblage of a dataset, data may be collected, digitized, adapted, and entered into a [[database]] according to human-designed [[cataloging]] criteria.<ref name="Gillespie et al">{{cite book|title=Media Technologies|last1=Gillespie|first1=Tarleton|last2=Boczkowski|first2=Pablo|last3=Foot|first3=Kristin|publisher=MIT Press|year=2014|isbn=9780262525374|location=Cambridge|pages=1–30 }}</ref>{{rp|3}} Next, programmers assign priorities, or [[Hierarchy|hierarchies]], for how a program assesses and sorts that data. This requires human decisions about how data is categorized, and which data is included or discarded.<ref name="Gillespie et al" />{{rp|4}} Some algorithms collect their own data based on human-selected criteria, which can also reflect the bias of human designers.<ref name="Gillespie et al" />{{rp|8}} Other algorithms may reinforce stereotypes and preferences as they process and display "relevant" data for human users, for example, by selecting information based on previous choices of a similar user or group of users.<ref name="Gillespie et al" />{{rp|6}}

Beyond assembling and processing data, bias can emerge as a result of design.<ref name="TowCenter">{{cite web|last1=Diakopoulos|first1=Nicholas|title=Algorithmic Accountability: On the Investigation of Black Boxes {{!}}|url=https://towcenter.org/research/algorithmic-accountability-on-the-investigation-of-black-boxes-2/|website=towcenter.org|access-date=19 November 2017}}</ref> For example, algorithms that determine the allocation of resources or scrutiny (such as determining school placements) may inadvertently discriminate against a category when determining risk based on similar users (as in credit scores).<ref name="Lipartito">{{cite report|last1=Lipartito|first1=Kenneth|title=The Narrative and the Algorithm: Genres of Credit Reporting from the Nineteenth Century to Today|date=6 January 2011|doi=10.2139/SSRN.1736283 |ssrn=1736283|s2cid=166742927|url=https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/28142/1/MPRA_paper_28142.pdf|type=Submitted manuscript}}</ref>{{rp|36}} Meanwhile, recommendation engines that work by associating users with similar users, or that make use of inferred marketing traits, might rely on inaccurate associations that reflect broad ethnic, gender, socio-economic, or racial stereotypes. Another example comes from determining criteria for what is included and excluded from results. This criteria could present unanticipated outcomes for search results, such as with flight-recommendation software that omits flights that do not follow the sponsoring airline's flight paths.<ref name="TowCenter" /> Algorithms may also display an ''uncertainty bias'', offering more confident assessments when larger [[data set]]s are available. This can skew algorithmic processes toward results that more closely correspond with larger samples, which may disregard data from underrepresented populations.<ref name="GoodmanFlaxman2016">{{Cite journal|last1=Goodman|first1=Bryce|last2=Flaxman|first2=Seth|title=EU regulations on algorithmic decision-making and a "right to explanation"|journal=[[AI Magazine]] |volume=38 |issue=3 |pages=50 |arxiv=1606.08813 |doi=10.1609/aimag.v38i3.2741 |year=2017|s2cid=7373959}}</ref>{{rp|4}}

=== Early critiques ===
[[File:Used Punchcard (5151286161).jpg|thumb|This card was used to load software into an old mainframe computer. Each byte (the letter 'A', for example) is entered by punching holes. Though contemporary computers are more complex, they reflect this human decision-making process in collecting and processing data.<ref name="Weizenbaum1976" />{{rp|70}}<ref name="Goffrey" />{{rp|16}}]]
The earliest computer programs were designed to mimic human reasoning and deductions, and were deemed to be functioning when they successfully and consistently reproduced that human logic. In his 1976 book ''[[Computer Power and Human Reason]]'', [[artificial intelligence]] pioneer [[Joseph Weizenbaum]] suggested that bias could arise both from the data used in a program, but also from the way a program is coded.<ref name="Weizenbaum1976" />{{rp|149}}

Weizenbaum wrote that [[Computer program|programs]] are a sequence of rules created by humans for a computer to follow. By following those rules consistently, such programs "embody law",<ref name="Weizenbaum1976">{{cite book|last1=Weizenbaum|first1=Joseph|title=Computer Power and Human Reason: From Judgment to Calculation |url=https://archive.org/details/computerpowerhum0000weiz|url-access=registration|date=1976|publisher=W.H. Freeman|location=San Francisco|isbn=978-0-7167-0464-5}}</ref>{{rp|40}} that is, enforce a specific way to solve problems. The rules a computer follows are based on the assumptions of a computer programmer for how these problems might be solved. That means the code could incorporate the programmer's imagination of how the world works, including their biases and expectations.<ref name="Weizenbaum1976" />{{rp|109}} While a computer program can incorporate bias in this way, Weizenbaum also noted that any data fed to a machine additionally reflects "human decisionmaking processes" as data is being selected.<ref name="Weizenbaum1976" />{{rp|70, 105}}

Finally, he noted that machines might also transfer good information with [[unintended consequence]]s if users are unclear about how to interpret the results.<ref name="Weizenbaum1976" />{{rp|65}} Weizenbaum warned against trusting decisions made by computer programs that a user doesn't understand, comparing such faith to a tourist who can find his way to a hotel room exclusively by turning left or right on a coin toss. Crucially, the tourist has no basis of understanding how or why he arrived at his destination, and a successful arrival does not mean the process is accurate or reliable.<ref name="Weizenbaum1976" />{{rp|226}}

An early example of algorithmic bias resulted in as many as 60 women and ethnic minorities denied entry to [[St George's, University of London|St. George's Hospital Medical School]] per year from 1982 to 1986, based on implementation of a new computer-guidance assessment system that denied entry to women and men with "foreign-sounding names" based on historical trends in admissions.<ref name="LowryMacpherson">{{cite journal|last1=Lowry|first1=Stella|last2=Macpherson|first2=Gordon|date=5 March 1988|title=A Blot on the Profession|url=http://europepmc.org/backend/ptpmcrender.fcgi?accid=PMC2545288&blobtype=pdf|journal=British Medical Journal|volume=296|issue=6623|pages=657–8|access-date=17 November 2017|pmid=3128356|pmc=2545288|doi=10.1136/bmj.296.6623.657}}</ref> While many schools at the time employed similar biases in their selection process, St. George was most notable for automating said bias through the use of an algorithm, thus gaining the attention of people on a much wider scale.

In recent years, when more algorithms started to use machine learning methods on real world data, algorithmic bias can be found more often due to the bias existing in the data.

=== Contemporary critiques and responses ===
Though well-designed algorithms frequently determine outcomes that are equally (or more) equitable than the decisions of human beings, cases of bias still occur, and are difficult to predict and analyze.<ref name="Miller">{{cite journal |last1=Miller |first1=Alex P. |title=Want Less-Biased Decisions?

For example, if data shows a high number of arrests in a particular area, an algorithm may assign more police patrols to that area, which could lead to more arrests.<ref name="IntronaWood">{{cite journal|last1=Introna|first1=Lucas|last2=Wood|first2=David|date=2004|title=Picturing algorithmic surveillance: the politics of facial recognition systems|url=http://nbn-resolving.de/urn:nbn:de:0168-ssoar-200675|journal=Surveillance & Society|volume=2|pages=177–198|access-date=19 November 2017}}</ref>{{rp|180}}

For example, a list of news items selected and presented as "trending" or "popular" may be created based on significantly wider criteria than just their popularity.<ref name="Gillespie et al" />{{rp|14}}

== Types ==

=== Pre-existing ===

Pre-existing bias in an algorithm is a consequence of underlying social and institutional [[Ideology|ideologies]]. Such ideas may influence or create personal biases within individual designers or programmers. Such prejudices can be explicit and conscious, or implicit and unconscious.<ref name="FriedmanNissenbaum" />{{rp|334}}<ref name="Tewell" />{{rp|294}} Poorly selected input data, or simply data from a biased source, will influence the outcomes created by machines.<ref name="Goffrey">{{cite book|last1=Goffrey|first1=Andrew|editor1-last=Fuller|editor1-first=Matthew|title=Software Studies: A Lexicon|url=https://archive.org/details/softwarestudiesl00full_007|url-access=limited|date=2008|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Mass.|isbn=978-1-4356-4787-9|pages=[https://archive.org/details/softwarestudiesl00full_007/page/n29 15]–20|chapter=Algorithm}}</ref>{{rp|17}} Encoding pre-existing bias into software can preserve social and institutional bias, and, without correction, could be replicated in all future uses of that algorithm.<ref name="Introna1" />{{rp|116}}<ref name="Ziewitz1" />{{rp|8}}

An example of this form of bias is the British Nationality Act Program, designed to automate the evaluation of new British citizens after the 1981 [[British Nationality Act]].<ref name="FriedmanNissenbaum" />{{rp|341}} The program accurately reflected the tenets of the law, which stated that "a man is the father of only his legitimate children, whereas a woman is the mother of all her children, legitimate or not."<ref name="FriedmanNissenbaum" />{{rp|341}}<ref name="SergotEtAl">{{cite journal|last1=Sergot|first1=MJ|last2=Sadri|first2=F|last3=Kowalski|first3=RA|last4=Kriwaczek|first4=F|last5=Hammond|first5=P|last6=Cory|first6=HT|title=The British Nationality Act as a Logic Program|journal=Communications of the ACM|date=May 1986|volume=29|issue=5|pages=370–386|url=https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs227/Readings/BritishNationalityAct.pdf|access-date=18 November 2017|doi=10.1145/5689.5920|s2cid=5665107}}</ref>{{rp|375}} In its attempt to transfer a particular logic into an algorithmic process, the BNAP inscribed the logic of the British Nationality Act into its algorithm, which would perpetuate it even if the act was eventually repealed.<ref name="FriedmanNissenbaum" />{{rp|342}}

Another source of bias, which has been called “label choice bias",<ref>{{Cite web |title=To stop algorithmic bias, we first have to define it |url=https://www.brookings.edu/articles/to-stop-algorithmic-bias-we-first-have-to-define-it/ |access-date=2023-06-27 |website=Brookings |language=en-US}}</ref> arises when proxy measures are used to train algorithms, that build in bias against certain groups. For example, a widely-used algorithm predicted health care costs as a proxy for health care needs, and used predictions to allocate resources to help patients with complex health needs. This introduced bias because Black patients have lower costs, even when they are just as unhealthy as White patients<ref>{{Cite news |last1=Evans |first1=Melanie |last2=Mathews |first2=Anna Wilde |date=2019-10-24 |title=Researchers Find Racial Bias in Hospital Algorithm |language=en-US |work=Wall Street Journal |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/researchers-find-racial-bias-in-hospital-algorithm-11571941096 |access-date=2023-06-27 |issn=0099-9660}}</ref> Solutions to the "label choice bias" aim to match the actual target (what the algorithm is predicting) more closely to the ideal target (what researchers want the algorithm to predict), so for the prior example, instead of predicting cost, researchers would focus on the variable of healthcare needs which is rather more significant. Adjusting the target led to almost double the number of Black patients being selected for the program.<ref>{{Cite web |title=To stop algorithmic bias, we first have to define it |url=https://www.brookings.edu/articles/to-stop-algorithmic-bias-we-first-have-to-define-it/ |access-date=2023-06-27 |website=Brookings |language=en-US}}</ref>

=== Technical ===
[[File:Three Surveillance cameras.jpg|thumb|Facial recognition software used in conjunction with surveillance cameras was found to display bias in recognizing Asian and black faces over white faces.<ref name="IntronaWood" />{{rp|191}}]]
Technical bias emerges through limitations of a program, computational power, its design, or other constraint on the system.<ref name="FriedmanNissenbaum" />{{rp|332}} Such bias can also be a restraint of design, for example, a search engine that shows three results per screen can be understood to privilege the top three results slightly more than the next three, as in an airline price display.<ref name="FriedmanNissenbaum" />{{rp|336}} Another case is software that relies on [[randomness]] for fair distributions of results. If the [[random number generation]] mechanism is not truly random, it can introduce bias, for example, by skewing selections toward items at the end or beginning of a list.<ref name="FriedmanNissenbaum" />{{rp|332}}

A ''decontextualized algorithm'' uses unrelated information to sort results, for example, a flight-pricing algorithm that sorts results by alphabetical order would be biased in favor of American Airlines over United Airlines.<ref name="FriedmanNissenbaum" />{{rp|332}} The opposite may also apply, in which results are evaluated in contexts different from which they are collected. Data may be collected without crucial external context: for example, when [[facial recognition system|facial recognition]] software is used by surveillance cameras, but evaluated by remote staff in another country or region, or evaluated by non-human algorithms with no awareness of what takes place beyond the camera's [[Visual field|field of vision]]. This could create an incomplete understanding of a crime scene, for example, potentially mistaking bystanders for those who commit the crime.<ref name="Graham" />{{rp|574}}

Lastly, technical bias can be created by attempting to formalize decisions into concrete steps on the assumption that human behavior works in the same way. For example, software weighs data points to determine whether a defendant should accept a plea bargain, while ignoring the impact of emotion on a jury.<ref name="FriedmanNissenbaum" />{{rp|332}} Another unintended result of this form of bias was found in the plagiarism-detection software [[Turnitin]], which compares student-written texts to information found online and returns a probability score that the student's work is copied. Because the software compares long strings of text, it is more likely to identify non-native speakers of English than native speakers, as the latter group might be better able to change individual words, break up strings of plagiarized text, or obscure copied passages through synonyms. Because it is easier for native speakers to evade detection as a result of the technical constraints of the software, this creates a scenario where Turnitin identifies foreign-speakers of English for plagiarism while allowing more native-speakers to evade detection.<ref name="Introna2" />{{rp|21–22}}

=== Emergent ===
[[Emergent properties|Emergent]] bias is the result of the use and reliance on algorithms across new or unanticipated contexts.<ref name="FriedmanNissenbaum" />{{rp|334}} Algorithms may not have been adjusted to consider new forms of knowledge, such as new drugs or medical breakthroughs, new laws, business models, or shifting cultural norms.<ref name="FriedmanNissenbaum" />{{rp|334,336}} This may exclude groups through technology, without providing clear outlines to understand who is responsible for their exclusion.<ref name="IntronaWood" />{{rp|179}}<ref name="Tewell" />{{rp|294}} Similarly, problems may emerge when [[training data]] (the samples "fed" to a machine, by which it models certain conclusions) do not align with contexts that an algorithm encounters in the real world.<ref name="Gillespie">{{cite web|url=http://culturedigitally.org/2014/06/algorithm-draft-digitalkeyword/|title=Algorithm [draft] [#digitalkeywords] – Culture Digitally|last1=Gillespie|first1=Tarleton|website=culturedigitally.org|access-date=20 November 2017}}</ref>

In 1990, an example of emergent bias was identified in the software used to place US medical students into residencies, the National Residency Match Program (NRMP).<ref name="FriedmanNissenbaum" />{{rp|338}} The algorithm was designed at a time when few married couples would seek residencies together. As more women entered medical schools, more students were likely to request a residency alongside their partners. The process called for each applicant to provide a list of preferences for placement across the US, which was then sorted and assigned when a hospital and an applicant both agreed to a match. In the case of married couples where both sought residencies, the algorithm weighed the location choices of the higher-rated partner first. The result was a frequent assignment of highly preferred schools to the first partner and lower-preferred schools to the second partner, rather than sorting for compromises in placement preference.<ref name="FriedmanNissenbaum" />{{rp|338}}<ref name="Roth">{{cite journal|last1=Roth|first1=A. E. 1524–1528.|title=New physicians: A natural experiment in market organization|journal=Science|date=14 December 1990|volume=250|issue=4987|pages=1524–1528|url=https://stanford.edu/~alroth/science.html|access-date=18 November 2017|bibcode=1990Sci...250.1524R|doi=10.1126/science.2274783|pmid=2274783|s2cid=23259274}}</ref>

Additional emergent biases include:

==== Correlations ====
Unpredictable correlations can emerge when large data sets are compared to each other. For example, data collected about web-browsing patterns may align with signals marking sensitive data (such as race or sexual orientation). By selecting according to certain behavior or browsing patterns, the end effect would be almost identical to discrimination through the use of direct race or sexual orientation data.<ref name="GoodmanFlaxman2016" />{{rp|6}} In other cases, the algorithm draws conclusions from correlations, without being able to understand those correlations. For example, one triage program gave lower priority to asthmatics who had pneumonia than asthmatics who did not have pneumonia. The program algorithm did this because it simply compared survival rates: asthmatics with pneumonia are at the highest risk. Historically, for this same reason, hospitals typically give such asthmatics the best and most immediate care.<ref name="Kuang">{{cite news|last1=Kuang|first1=Cliff|title=Can A.I. Be Taught to Explain Itself?|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/21/magazine/can-ai-be-taught-to-explain-itself.html|access-date=26 November 2017|work=[[The New York Times Magazine]]|date=21 November 2017}}</ref>{{clarify|date=September 2021}}

==== Unanticipated uses ====
Emergent bias can occur when an algorithm is used by unanticipated audiences. For example, machines may require that users can read, write, or understand numbers, or relate to an interface using metaphors that they do not understand.<ref name="FriedmanNissenbaum" />{{rp|334}} These exclusions can become compounded, as biased or exclusionary technology is more deeply integrated into society.<ref name="IntronaWood" />{{rp|179}}

Apart from exclusion, unanticipated uses may emerge from the end user relying on the software rather than their own knowledge. In one example, an unanticipated user group led to algorithmic bias in the UK, when the British National Act Program was created as a [[Proof of concept|proof-of-concept]] by computer scientists and immigration lawyers to evaluate suitability for [[British nationality law|British citizenship]]. The designers had access to legal expertise beyond the end users in immigration offices, whose understanding of both software and immigration law would likely have been unsophisticated. The agents administering the questions relied entirely on the software, which excluded alternative pathways to citizenship, and used the software even after new case laws and legal interpretations led the algorithm to become outdated. As a result of designing an algorithm for users assumed to be legally savvy on immigration law, the software's algorithm indirectly led to bias in favor of applicants who fit a very narrow set of legal criteria set by the algorithm, rather than by the more broader criteria of British immigration law.<ref name="FriedmanNissenbaum" />{{rp|342}}

==== Feedback loops ====
Emergent bias may also create a [[feedback loop]], or recursion, if data collected for an algorithm results in real-world responses which are fed back into the algorithm.<ref name="JouvenalPredPol">{{cite news|last1=Jouvenal|first1=Justin|title=Police are using software to predict crime.

The software is often criticized for labeling Black individuals as criminals much more likely than others, and then feeds the data back into itself in the event individuals become registered criminals, further enforcing the bias created by the dataset the algorithm is acting on.

=== Commercial influences ===
Corporate algorithms could be skewed to invisibly favor financial arrangements or agreements between companies, without the knowledge of a user who may mistake the algorithm as being impartial. For example, [[American Airlines]] created a flight-finding algorithm in the 1980s. The software presented a range of flights from various airlines to customers, but weighed factors that boosted its own flights, regardless of price or convenience. In testimony to the [[United States Congress]], the president of the airline stated outright that the system was created with the intention of gaining competitive advantage through preferential treatment.<ref name="Sandvig1" />{{rp|2}}<ref name="FriedmanNissenbaum">{{cite journal|last1=Friedman|first1=Batya|last2=Nissenbaum|first2=Helen|title=Bias in Computer Systems|journal=ACM Transactions on Information Systems|date=July 1996|volume=14|issue=3|pages=330–347|url=https://nissenbaum.tech.cornell.edu/papers/biasincomputers.pdf|access-date=10 March 2019|doi=10.1145/230538.230561|s2cid=207195759}}</ref>{{rp|331}}

=== Gender discrimination ===
In 2016, the professional networking site [[LinkedIn]] was discovered to recommend male variations of women's names in response to search queries. The site did not make similar recommendations in searches for male names. For example, "Andrea" would bring up a prompt asking if users meant "Andrew", but queries for "Andrew" did not ask if users meant to find "Andrea".

Web search algorithms have also been accused of bias. Google's results may prioritize pornographic content in search terms related to sexuality, for example, "lesbian".

For example, a 2012 study showed that names commonly associated with blacks were more likely to yield search results implying arrest records, regardless of whether there is any police record of that individual's name.<ref name="Sweeney">{{cite arXiv|last1=Sweeney|first1=Latanya|title=Discrimination in Online Ad Delivery|date=28 January 2013|class=cs.IR|eprint=1301.6822}}</ref> A 2015 study also found that Black and Asian people are assumed to have lesser functioning lungs due to racial and occupational exposure data not being incorporated into the prediction algorithm's model of lung function.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Braun|first=Lundy|date=2015|title=Race, ethnicity and lung function: A brief history|journal=Canadian Journal of Respiratory Therapy |volume=51|issue=4|pages=99–101|issn=1205-9838|pmc=4631137|pmid=26566381}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Robinson|first1=Whitney R|last2=Renson|first2=Audrey|last3=Naimi|first3=Ashley I|date=2020-04-01|title=Teaching yourself about structural racism will improve your machine learning|journal=Biostatistics|volume=21|issue=2|pages=339–344|doi=10.1093/biostatistics/kxz040|pmid=31742353|pmc=7868043|issn=1465-4644|doi-access=free}}</ref>

In 2019, a research study revealed that a healthcare algorithm sold by [[Optum]] favored white patients over sicker black patients. The algorithm predicts how much patients would cost the health-care system in the future. However, cost is not race-neutral, as black patients incurred about $1,800 less in medical costs per year than white patients with the same number of chronic conditions, which led to the algorithm scoring white patients as equally at risk of future health problems as black patients who suffered from significantly more diseases.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2019/10/24/racial-bias-medical-algorithm-favors-white-patients-over-sicker-black-patients/|title=Racial bias in a medical algorithm favors white patients over sicker black patients|first=Carolyn Y. |last=Johnson |date=24 October 2019|newspaper=Washington Post|language=en|access-date=2019-10-28}}</ref>

A study conducted by researchers at UC Berkeley in November 2019 revealed that mortgage algorithms have been discriminatory towards Latino and African Americans which discriminated against minorities based on "creditworthiness" which is rooted in the U.S. fair-lending law which allows lenders to use measures of identification to determine if an individual is worthy of receiving loans. These particular algorithms were present in FinTech companies and were shown to discriminate against minorities.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Bartlett|first1=Robert|last2=Morse|first2=Adair|last3=Stanton|first3=Richard|last4=Wallace|first4=Nancy|date=June 2019|title=Consumer-Lending Discrimination in the FinTech Era|url=http://www.nber.org/papers/w25943|journal=NBER Working Paper No. 25943|series=Working Paper Series |doi=10.3386/w25943|s2cid=242410791}}</ref>{{Primary source inline|date=December 2019}}

==== Law enforcement and legal proceedings ====
Algorithms already have numerous applications in legal systems. An example of this is [[COMPAS (software)|COMPAS]], a commercial program widely used by [[U.S. court]]s to assess the likelihood of a [[defendant]] becoming a [[recidivist]]. [[ProPublica]] claims that the average COMPAS-assigned recidivism risk level of black defendants is significantly higher than the average COMPAS-assigned risk level of white defendants, and that black defendants are twice as likely to be erroneously assigned the label "high-risk" as white defendants.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Jeff Larson|first=Julia Angwin|date=2016-05-23|title=How We Analyzed the COMPAS Recidivism Algorithm|url=https://www.propublica.org/article/how-we-analyzed-the-compas-recidivism-algorithm|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190429190950/https://www.propublica.org/article/how-we-analyzed-the-compas-recidivism-algorithm|archive-date=29 April 2019|access-date=2020-06-19|website=ProPublica|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=2019-01-12|title=Commentary: Bad news.

One example is the use of [[risk assessment]]s in [[criminal sentencing in the United States]] and [[Parole board|parole hearings]], judges were presented with an algorithmically generated score intended to reflect the risk that a prisoner will repeat a crime.<ref name="ProPublica">{{cite web|last1=Angwin|first1=Julia|last2=Larson|first2=Jeff|last3=Mattu|first3=Surya|last4=Kirchner|first4=Lauren|date=23 May 2016|title=Machine Bias — ProPublica|url=https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing|access-date=18 November 2017|website=ProPublica}}</ref> For the time period starting in 1920 and ending in 1970, the nationality of a criminal's father was a consideration in those risk assessment scores.<ref name="Harcourt">{{cite journal|last1=Harcourt|first1=Bernard|date=16 September 2010|title=Risk as a Proxy for Race |url=https://scholarship.law.columbia.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3568&context=faculty_scholarship |journal=Federal Sentencing Reporter |volume= 27 |issue=4 |page= 237|doi=10.1525/fsr.2015.27.4.237 |ssrn=1677654|s2cid=53611813 }}</ref>{{rp|4}} Today, these scores are shared with judges in Arizona, Colorado, Delaware, Kentucky, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Virginia, Washington, and Wisconsin. An independent investigation by [[ProPublica]] found that the scores were inaccurate 80% of the time, and disproportionately skewed to suggest blacks to be at risk of relapse, 77% more often than whites.<ref name="ProPublica" />

One study that set out to examine "Risk, Race, & Recidivism: Predictive Bias and Disparate Impact" alleges a two-fold (45 percent vs. 23 percent) adverse likelihood for black vs. Caucasian defendants to be misclassified as imposing a higher risk despite having objectively remained without any documented recidivism over a two-year period of observation.<ref>Skeem J, Lowenkamp C, Risk, Race, & Recidivism: Predictive Bias and Disparate Impact, (June 14, 2016). {{SSRN|2687339}}</ref> 

In the pretrial detention context, a law review article argues that algorithmic risk assessments violate [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th Amendment]] [[Equal Protection]] rights on the basis of race, since the algorithms are argued to be facially discriminatory, to result in disparate treatment, and to not be narrowly tailored.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Thomas|first1=C.|last2=Nunez|first2=A.|date=2022|title=Automating Judicial Discretion: How Algorithmic Risk Assessments in Pretrial Adjudications Violate Equal Protection Rights on the Basis of Race|journal=[[Law & Inequality]]|language=en|volume=40|issue=2|pages=371–407|url=https://scholarship.law.umn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1680&context=lawineq|doi=10.24926/25730037.649}}</ref>

==== Online hate speech ====
In 2017 a [[Facebook]] algorithm designed to remove online hate speech was found to advantage white men over black children when assessing objectionable content, according to internal Facebook documents.<ref name="AngwinGrassegger">{{cite web|url=https://www.propublica.org/article/facebook-hate-speech-censorship-internal-documents-algorithms|title=Facebook's Secret Censorship Rules Protect White Men From Hate Speech But Not Black Children — ProPublica|last1=Angwin|first1=Julia|last2=Grassegger|first2=Hannes|date=28 June 2017|website=ProPublica|access-date=20 November 2017}}</ref> The algorithm, which is a combination of computer programs and human content reviewers, was created to protect broad categories rather than specific subsets of categories. For example, posts denouncing "Muslims" would be blocked, while posts denouncing "Radical Muslims" would be allowed. An unanticipated outcome of the algorithm is to allow hate speech against black children, because they denounce the "children" subset of blacks, rather than "all blacks", whereas "all white men" would trigger a block, because whites and males are not considered subsets.<ref name="AngwinGrassegger" /> Facebook was also found to allow ad purchasers to target "Jew haters" as a category of users, which the company said was an inadvertent outcome of algorithms used in assessing and categorizing data. The company's design also allowed ad buyers to block African-Americans from seeing housing ads.<ref name="AngwinVarnerTobin">{{cite news|url=https://www.propublica.org/article/facebook-enabled-advertisers-to-reach-jew-haters|title=Facebook Enabled Advertisers to Reach 'Jew Haters' — ProPublica|last1=Angwin|first1=Julia|date=14 September 2017|work=ProPublica|access-date=20 November 2017|last2=Varner|first2=Madeleine|last3=Tobin|first3=Ariana}}</ref>

The shifting nature of disabilities and its subjective characterization, makes it more difficult to computationally address. The lack of historical depth in defining disabilities, collecting its incidence and prevalence in questionnaires, and establishing recognition add to the controversy and ambiguity in its quantification and calculations.  The definition of disability has been long debated shifting from a [[Medical model of disability|medical model]] to a [[social model of disability]] most recently, which establishes that disability is a result of the mismatch between people's interactions and barriers in their environment, rather than impairments and health conditions. Disabilities can also be situational or temporary,<ref>{{Cite web |title=Microsoft Design |url=https://www.microsoft.com/design/inclusive/ |access-date=2022-12-02 |website=www.microsoft.com |language=en-us}}</ref> considered in a constant state of flux.

Given the stereotypes and stigmas that still exist surrounding disabilities, the sensitive nature of revealing these identifying characteristics also carries vast privacy challenges,  As disclosing disability information can be taboo and drive further discrimination against this population, there is a lack of explicit disability data available for algorithmic systems to interact with. People with disabilities face additional harms and risks with respect to their social support, cost of health insurance, workplace discrimination and other basic necessities upon disclosing their disability status.

Literature on algorithmic bias has focused on the remedy of fairness, but definitions of fairness are often incompatible with each other and the realities of machine learning optimization.

An example of this complexity can be found in the range of inputs into customizing feedback. The social media site Facebook factored in at least 100,000 data points to determine the layout of a user's social media feed in 2013.<ref name="McGee">{{cite web|last1=McGee|first1=Matt|title=EdgeRank Is Dead: Facebook's News Feed Algorithm Now Has Close To 100K Weight Factors|url=https://marketingland.com/edgerank-is-dead-facebooks-news-feed-algorithm-now-has-close-to-100k-weight-factors-55908|website=Marketing Land|access-date=18 November 2017|date=16 August 2013}}</ref> Furthermore, large teams of programmers may operate in relative isolation from one another, and be unaware of the cumulative effects of small decisions within connected, elaborate algorithms.<ref name="Introna1" />{{rp|118}} Not all code is original, and may be borrowed from other libraries, creating a complicated set of relationships between data processing and data input systems.<ref name="Kitchin">{{cite journal|last1=Kitchin|first1=Rob|date=25 February 2016|title=Thinking critically about and researching algorithms|url=http://mural.maynoothuniversity.ie/11591/1/Kitchin_Thinking_2017.pdf|journal=Information, Communication & Society|volume=20|issue=1|pages=14–29|doi=10.1080/1369118X.2016.1154087|s2cid=13798875}}</ref>{{rp|22}}

Additional complexity occurs through [[machine learning]] and the personalization of algorithms based on user interactions such as clicks, time spent on site, and other metrics. These personal adjustments can confuse general attempts to understand algorithms.<ref name="Granka">{{cite journal|last1=Granka|first1=Laura A.|date=27 September 2010|title=The Politics of Search: A Decade Retrospective|url=https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/36914.pdf|journal=The Information Society|volume=26|issue=5|pages=364–374|doi=10.1080/01972243.2010.511560|s2cid=16306443|access-date=18 November 2017}}</ref>{{rp|367}}<ref name="Sandvig2" />{{rp|7}} One unidentified streaming radio service reported that it used five unique music-selection algorithms it selected for its users, based on their behavior. This creates different experiences of the same streaming services between different users, making it harder to understand what these algorithms do.<ref name="Seaver" />{{rp|5}}
Companies also run frequent [[A/B tests]] to fine-tune algorithms based on user response. For example, the search engine [[Bing (search engine)|Bing]] can run up to ten million subtle variations of its service per day, creating different experiences of the service between each use and/or user.<ref name="Seaver" />{{rp|5}}

=== Lack of transparency ===
Commercial algorithms are proprietary, and may be treated as [[trade secrets]].<ref name="Seaver" />{{rp|2}}<ref name="Sandvig2" />{{rp|7}}<ref name="IntronaWood" />{{rp|183}} Treating algorithms as trade secrets protects companies, such as [[Web search engine|search engines]], where a transparent algorithm might reveal tactics to manipulate search rankings.<ref name="Granka" />{{rp|366}} This makes it difficult for researchers to conduct interviews or analysis to discover how algorithms function.<ref name="Kitchin" />{{rp|20}} Critics suggest that such secrecy can also obscure possible unethical methods used in producing or processing algorithmic output.<ref name="Granka" />{{rp|369}} Other critics, such as lawyer and activist Katarzyna Szymielewicz, have suggested that the lack of transparency is often disguised as a result of algorithmic complexity, shielding companies from disclosing or investigating its own algorithmic processes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/@szymielewicz/black-boxed-politics-cebc0d5a54ad|title=Black-Boxed Politics|last=Szymielewicz|first=Katarzyna|date=2020-01-20|website=Medium|language=en|access-date=2020-02-11}}</ref>

=== Lack of data about sensitive categories ===
A significant barrier to understanding the tackling of bias in practice is that categories, such as demographics of individuals protected by [[anti-discrimination law]], are often not explicitly considered when collecting and processing data.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Veale|first1=Michael|last2=Binns|first2=Reuben|date=2017|title=Fairer machine learning in the real world: Mitigating discrimination without collecting sensitive data|journal=Big Data & Society|volume=4|issue=2|pages=205395171774353|doi=10.1177/2053951717743530|ssrn=3060763|doi-access=free}}</ref> In some cases, there is little opportunity to collect this data explicitly, such as in [[device fingerprint]]ing, [[ubiquitous computing]] and the [[Internet of things|Internet of Things]]. In other cases, the data controller may not wish to collect such data for reputational reasons, or because it represents a heightened liability and security risk. It may also be the case that, at least in relation to the European Union's [[General Data Protection Regulation]], such data falls under the 'special category' provisions (Article 9), and therefore comes with more restrictions on potential collection and processing.

Some practitioners have tried to estimate and impute these missing sensitive categorisations in order to allow bias mitigation, for example building systems to infer ethnicity from names,<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Elliott|first1=Marc N.|last2=Morrison|first2=Peter A.|last3=Fremont|first3=Allen|last4=McCaffrey|first4=Daniel F.|last5=Pantoja|first5=Philip|last6=Lurie|first6=Nicole|date=June 2009|title=Using the Census Bureau's surname list to improve estimates of race/ethnicity and associated disparities|journal=Health Services and Outcomes Research Methodology|volume=9|issue=2|pages=69–83|doi=10.1007/s10742-009-0047-1|s2cid=43293144|issn=1387-3741}}</ref> however this can introduce other forms of bias if not undertaken with care.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Chen|first1=Jiahao|last2=Kallus|first2=Nathan|last3=Mao|first3=Xiaojie|last4=Svacha|first4=Geoffry|last5=Udell|first5=Madeleine|title=Proceedings of the Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency |chapter=Fairness Under Unawareness |date=2019|chapter-url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=3287560.3287594|location=Atlanta, GA, USA|publisher=ACM Press|pages=339–348|doi=10.1145/3287560.3287594|isbn=9781450361255|arxiv=1811.11154|s2cid=58006233}}</ref> Machine learning researchers have drawn upon cryptographic [[privacy-enhancing technologies]] such as [[secure multi-party computation]] to propose methods whereby algorithmic bias can be assessed or mitigated without these data ever being available to modellers in [[cleartext]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Kilbertus|first1=Niki|last2=Gascon|first2=Adria|last3=Kusner|first3=Matt|last4=Veale|first4=Michael|last5=Gummadi|first5=Krishna|last6=Weller|first6=Adrian|date=2018|title=Blind Justice: Fairness with Encrypted Sensitive Attributes|url=http://proceedings.mlr.press/v80/kilbertus18a.html|journal=International Conference on Machine Learning|pages=2630–2639|bibcode=2018arXiv180603281K|arxiv=1806.03281}}</ref>

Algorithmic bias does not only include protected categories, but can also concern characteristics less easily observable or codifiable, such as political viewpoints. In these cases, there is rarely an easily accessible or non-controversial [[ground truth]], and removing the bias from such a system is more difficult.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Binns|first1=Reuben|last2=Veale|first2=Michael|last3=Kleek|first3=Max Van|last4=Shadbolt|first4=Nigel|title=Social Informatics |chapter=Like Trainer, Like Bot?

==Solutions==
A study of 84 policy guidelines on ethical AI found that fairness and "mitigation of unwanted bias" was a common point of concern, and were addressed through a blend of technical solutions, transparency and monitoring, right to remedy and increased oversight, and diversity and inclusion efforts.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last1=Jobin|first1=Anna|last2=Ienca|first2=Marcello|last3=Vayena|first3=Effy|author-link3=Effy Vayena|date=2 September 2019|title=The global landscape of AI ethics guidelines|journal=Nature Machine Intelligence|volume=1|issue=9|pages=389–399|doi=10.1038/s42256-019-0088-2|arxiv=1906.11668|s2cid=201827642}}</ref>

There have been several attempts to create methods and tools that can detect and observe biases within an algorithm. These emergent fields focus on tools which are typically applied to the (training) data used by the program rather than the algorithm's internal processes. These methods may also analyze a program's output and its usefulness and therefore may involve the analysis of its [[confusion matrix]] (or table of confusion).<ref>https://research.google.com/bigpicture/attacking-discrimination-in-ml/ Attacking discrimination with smarter machine learning</ref><ref>{{cite arXiv |eprint=1610.02413|last1=Hardt|first1=Moritz|title=Equality of Opportunity in Supervised Learning|last2=Price|first2=Eric|last3=Srebro|first3=Nathan|class=cs.LG|year=2016}}</ref><ref>https://venturebeat.com/2018/05/25/microsoft-is-developing-a-tool-to-help-engineers-catch-bias-in-algorithms/ Microsoft is developing a tool to help engineers catch bias in algorithms</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Facebook says it has a tool to detect bias in its artificial intelligence |date=2018-05-03 |website=[[Quartz (publication)|Quartz]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230305194710/https://qz.com/1268520/facebook-says-it-has-a-tool-to-detect-bias-in-its-artificial-intelligence |archive-date=2023-03-05 |url-status=live |url=https://qz.com/1268520/facebook-says-it-has-a-tool-to-detect-bias-in-its-artificial-intelligence/}}</ref><ref>[https://github.com/pymetrics/audit-ai open source] Pymetrics audit-ai</ref><ref>https://venturebeat-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/venturebeat.com/2018/05/31/pymetrics-open-sources-audit-ai-an-algorithm-bias-detection-tool/amp/ Pymetrics open-sources Audit AI, an algorithm bias detection tool</ref><ref>https://github.com/dssg/aequitas open source Aequitas: Bias and Fairness Audit Toolkit</ref><ref>https://dsapp.uchicago.edu/aequitas/ open-sources Audit AI, Aequitas at University of Chicago</ref><ref>https://www.ibm.com/blogs/research/2018/02/mitigating-bias-ai-models/ Mitigating Bias in AI Models</ref> Explainable AI to detect algorithm Bias is a suggested way to detect the existence of bias in an algorithm or learning model.<ref>S.

Ensuring that an AI tool such as a classifier is free from bias is more difficult than just removing the sensitive information
from its input signals, because this is typically implicit in other signals. For example, the hobbies, sports and schools attended
by a job candidate might reveal their gender to the software, even when this is removed from the analysis. Solutions to this
problem involve ensuring that the intelligent agent does not have any information that could be used to reconstruct the protected
and sensitive information about the subject, as first demonstrated in <ref>{{Cite conference| title =Right for the right reason: Training agnostic networks. | publisher =Springer | last1=  Jia|  first1 = Sen| last2= Welfare| first2 = Thomas | last3=Cristianini |first3 = Nello | date =2018 | conference = International Symposium on Intelligent Data Analysis}}</ref> where a deep learning network was simultaneously trained to learn a task while at the same time being completely agnostic about the protected feature.

Currently, a new [[IEEE Standards Association|IEEE standard]] is being drafted that aims to specify methodologies which help creators of algorithms eliminate issues of bias and articulate transparency (i.e. to authorities or [[end user]]s) about the function and possible effects of their algorithms. The project was approved February 2017 and is sponsored by the [https://www.computer.org/web/standards/s2esc Software & Systems Engineering Standards Committee], a committee chartered by the [[IEEE Computer Society]].

An initial approach towards transparency included the [[Open-source software|open-sourcing of algorithms]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Heald|first=David|title=Transparency: The Key to Better Governance?|date=2006-09-07|publisher=British Academy|isbn=978-0-19-726383-9|language=en|doi=10.5871/bacad/9780197263839.003.0002}}</ref> Software code can be looked into and improvements can be proposed through [[Comparison of source-code-hosting facilities|source-code-hosting facilities]]. However, this approach doesn't necessarily produce the intended effects. Companies and organizations can share all possible documentation and code, but this does not establish transparency if the audience doesn't understand the information given. Therefore, the role of an interested critical audience is worth exploring in relation to transparency. Algorithms cannot be held accountable without a critical audience.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Kemper|first1=Jakko|last2=Kolkman|first2=Daan|date=2019-12-06|title=Transparent to whom?

=== Interdisciplinarity and Collaboration ===
Integrating [[interdisciplinarity]] and collaboration in developing of AI systems can play a critical role in tackling algorithmic bias. Integrating insights, expertise, and perspectives from disciplines outside of computer science can foster a better understanding of the impact data driven solutions have on society. An example of this in AI research is PACT or ''Participatory Approach to enable Capabilities in communiTies,'' a proposed framework for facilitating collaboration when developing AI driven solutions concerned with social impact.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://ezpa.library.ualberta.ca/ezpAuthen.cgi?url=https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3461702.3462612 |access-date=2023-04-06 |via=ezpa.library.ualberta.ca |doi=10.1145/3461702.3462612| arxiv=2105.01774 | s2cid=233740121 | last1=Bondi | first1=Elizabeth | last2=Xu | first2=Lily | last3=Acosta-Navas | first3=Diana | last4=Killian | first4=Jackson A. | title=Proceedings of the 2021 AAAI/ACM Conference on AI, Ethics, and Society | chapter=Envisioning Communities: A Participatory Approach Towards AI for Social Good | year=2021 | pages=425–436 | isbn=9781450384735 }}</ref> This framework identifies guiding principals for stakeholder participation when working on AI for Social Good (AI4SG) projects. PACT attempts to reify the importance of decolonizing and power-shifting efforts in the design of human-centered AI solutions. An academic initiative in this regard is the Stanford University's Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence which aims to foster multidisciplinary collaboration. The mission of the institute is to advance artificial intelligence (AI) research, education, policy and practice to improve the human condition. <ref>{{Cite web |last=University |first=Stanford |date=2019-03-18 |title=Stanford University launches the Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence |url=https://news.stanford.edu/2019/03/18/stanford_university_launches_human-centered_ai/ |access-date=2023-04-06 |website=Stanford News |language=en}}</ref>

Collaboration with outside experts and various stakeholders facilitates ethical, inclusive, and accountable development of intelligent systems. It incorporates ethical considerations, understands the social and cultural context, promotes human-centered design, leverages technical expertise, and addresses policy and legal considerations.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Bondi |first1=Elizabeth |last2=Xu |first2=Lily |last3=Acosta-Navas |first3=Diana |last4=Killian |first4=Jackson A. |title=Proceedings of the 2021 AAAI/ACM Conference on AI, Ethics, and Society |chapter=Envisioning Communities: A Participatory Approach Towards AI for Social Good |date=2021-07-21 |pages=425–436 |doi=10.1145/3461702.3462612|arxiv=2105.01774 |isbn=9781450384735 |s2cid=233740121 }}</ref> Collaboration across disciplines is essential to effectively mitigate bias in AI systems and ensure that AI technologies are fair, transparent, and accountable.

== Regulation ==

=== Europe ===
The [[General Data Protection Regulation]] (GDPR), the [[European Union]]'s revised data protection regime that was implemented in 2018, addresses "Automated individual decision-making, including [[Profiling (information science)|profiling]]" in Article 22. These rules prohibit "solely" automated decisions which have a "significant" or "legal" effect on an individual, unless they are explicitly authorised by consent, contract, or [[Member state of the European Union|member state]] law. Where they are permitted, there must be safeguards in place, such as a right to a [[human-in-the-loop]], and a non-binding [[right to an explanation]] of decisions reached. While these regulations are commonly considered to be new, nearly identical provisions have existed across Europe since 1995, in Article 15 of the [[Data Protection Directive]]. The original automated decision rules and safeguards found in French law since the late 1970s.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bygrave|first=Lee A|journal=Computer Law & Security Review|volume=17|issue=1|pages=17–24|doi=10.1016/s0267-3649(01)00104-2|year=2001|title=Automated Profiling}}</ref>

The GDPR addresses algorithmic bias in profiling systems, as well as the statistical approaches possible to clean it, directly in [[Recital (law)|recital]] 71,<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal|last1=Veale|first1=Michael|last2=Edwards|first2=Lilian|date=2018|title=Clarity, Surprises, and Further Questions in the Article 29 Working Party Draft Guidance on Automated Decision-Making and Profiling|journal=Computer Law & Security Review|volume=34 |issue=2 |pages=398–404 |doi=10.1016/j.clsr.2017.12.002|ssrn=3071679|s2cid=4797884 |url=http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/10046182/1/Veale%201-s2.0-S026736491730376X-main%281%29.pdf}}</ref> noting that<blockquote>the controller should use appropriate mathematical or statistical procedures for the profiling, implement technical and organisational measures appropriate&nbsp;... that prevents, inter alia, discriminatory effects on natural persons on the basis of racial or ethnic origin, political opinion, religion or beliefs, trade union membership, genetic or health status or sexual orientation, or that result in measures having such an effect.</blockquote>Like the non-binding [[right to an explanation]] in recital 71, the problem is the non-binding nature of [[Recital (law)|recitals]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Wachter|first1=Sandra|last2=Mittelstadt|first2=Brent|last3=Floridi|first3=Luciano|date=1 May 2017|title=Why a Right to Explanation of Automated Decision-Making Does Not Exist in the General Data Protection Regulation|journal=International Data Privacy Law|volume=7|issue=2|pages=76–99|doi=10.1093/idpl/ipx005|issn=2044-3994|doi-access=free}}</ref> While it has been treated as a requirement by the [[Article 29 Working Party]] that advised on the implementation of data protection law,<ref name=":1" /> its practical dimensions are unclear.

It recommended researchers to "design these systems so that their actions and decision-making are transparent and easily interpretable by humans, and thus can be examined for any bias they may contain, rather than just learning and repeating these biases".

On July 31, 2018, a draft of the Personal Data Bill was presented.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/international/2018/07/31/496489.htm|title=India Weighs Comprehensive Data Privacy Bill, Similar to EU's GDPR|date=2018-07-31|website=Insurance Journal|access-date=2019-02-26}}</ref> The draft proposes standards for the storage, processing and transmission of data. While it does not use the term algorithm, it makes for provisions for "harm resulting from any processing or any kind of processing undertaken by the fiduciary". It defines "any denial or withdrawal of a service, benefit or good resulting from an evaluative decision about the data principal" or "any discriminatory treatment" as a source of harm that could arise from improper use of data. It also makes special provisions for people of "Intersex status".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://meity.gov.in/writereaddata/files/Personal_Data_Protection_Bill,2018.pdf |title=The Personal Data Protection Bill, 2018 |publisher=Ministry of Electronics & Information Technology, Government of India |date=2018 |access-date=29 April 2022}}</ref>
