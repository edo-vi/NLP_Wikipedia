== Context of the music video ==
=== Synopsis ===

The video begins with an image of an ICE officer's weapon, handcuffs, and vest. It then switches to the lives of three characters, Martha, Juan, and Jose. Martha was young when she came to the U.S. illegally and has hopes of obtaining an education. Jose is also an immigrant who was a taxi driver in his country but that doesn't permit him to drive in the U.S. Jose and Martha are both separately seen watching the news of people being deported at their jobs. Juan is a young man whose background is not mentioned as much as the other characters but it is shown that he has a family. All three characters are seen going to work and it is revealed that Jose and Martha work together in a restaurant. Juan is then seen working as an ICE officer where he and a couple of other ICE officers go to the restaurant where Jose and Martha work. Martha tries to escape but is surrounded, along with Jose, by ICE officers. Juan sadly looks at them before taking them into custody. The video switches to Martha's family as they tearfully look at the television where they see Martha being deported. The video ends with a statement that explains how most of the actors in the video are undocumented. It then states that two of the actors have been placed in deportation proceedings while one of the actor's parents are in the process of being deported.<ref>"La Santa Cecilia Da Voz a Los Indocumentados Con El Tema "El Hielo""Vidalatinasd.com.

=== Inspiration ===

The inspiration for the song came when the group had begun to work on their new album and wanted to share the experiences of their parent's illegal migration to the U.S.<ref name="LevinJordan" /> In an interview, the lead singer Marisol Hernandez discusses how the challenges her family have faced served as inspiration for ICE;El Hielo. She comments that her parents immigrated to the U.S. in the late 60s. Her mother cleaned houses and offices while also working as a babysitter. When Marisol's great-grandmother died, her mother was distraught and couldn't miss the funeral. Her mother went to Mexico but it caused her to be away from her family for a long time.<ref name="LevinJordan" /> Marisol also discusses the challenges her bandmate Pepe Carlos has endured for being undocumented. When the band receives gigs outside of California, the situation becomes complicated for the group because of Pepe's undocumented status. There are times where he will go with them and they have to take different routes to avoid checkpoints. However, when the band has been invited to play in Mexico, he has had to stay behind.<ref name="LevinJordan" />

=== ICE ===

As mentioned above, this track does indeed take a subtle whack at ICE—otherwise known as U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement—and Uncle Sam's immigration policy in general.<ref name="JohnsonReed" /> “ICE is the largest investigative agency in the [[United States Department of Homeland Security]] (DHS).”<ref>"Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)." Shusterman.com.</ref>

=== Lyrical interpretation ===

The lyrics, “set to a bouncy bossa nova groove”, tell the stories of three hardworking undocumented characters who fear separation from their families because, “ICE is loose out on the streets”, as the chorus clearly states.<ref>Montgomery, David. "L.A. Band La Santa Cecilia Speaking out for Undocumented Immigrants." The Washington Post. 9 Apr. 2013.</ref> The lyrics were inspired by three people close to the band. For example, the story of Eva, who is a housekeeper herself and represents the life and daily situations that many domestic workers face in regards to deportation.<ref name="GuidoSong">Guido. "Song Review: La Santa Cecilia’s “El Hielo (Ice)”." Remezcla Musica, 7 Mar. 2013.</ref> In the first half of the first verse, La Marisoul sings, “Eva using a rag to wipe clean the table/Cautiously making everything shines like a pearl/When the boss gets home, she hopes there’ll be no complaints/Accusing her of being illegal.”<ref>Quesem, Queso. "La Santa Cecilia: ‘El Hielo (ICE)’ Is Loose on the Streets (Music Video)." Pocho RSS. 9 Apr. 2013.</ref> The chorus then addresses the stories of families that have been separated by deportations of the Immigrant and Customs Enforcement (ICE). One of the most moving visuals of the lyrics is found in the line about children crying at school, when they realize that their mom is not coming to pick them up. It states that ICE is on the loose and one never knows who the next unfortunate victim will be. “Some stay here, the other stays there/This is what happens when you go out to make a living”.<ref name="GuidoSong" />
