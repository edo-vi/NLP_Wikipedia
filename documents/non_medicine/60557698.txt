'''Military geology''' is the application of [[Geologist|geological]] [[Geology|theory]] to warfare and the peacetime practices of the military. The formal practice of military geology began during the [[Napoleonic Wars]]; however, [[Geotechnical engineering|geotechnical]] knowledge has been applied since the earliest days of [[Siege|siege warfare]].<ref name="Underwood 1998">{{cite journal|last=James R.

In the [[Korean Demilitarized Zone|Demilitarized Zone]] between [[North Korea|North]] and [[South Korea]], very rugged terrain is due to the structure of metamorphic rocks, while the best flat land is underlain by [[granite]]. During the [[Korean War]], these flat areas were used as military staging grounds by the North Koreans. It has been suggested that an understanding of the fracture and [[Foliation (geology)|foliation]] patterns of the metamorphic rocks could help a field commander.<ref name="Cameron1998">{{cite book|last1=Cameron|first1=C.

This field partially overlaps with [[military geography]]. For this reason the [[British Army]] employed [[geographer]]s in this role until the end of 1941, when it joined international common practice and started using geologists.<ref name="forbes.com" />

{{See also|Military engineering|Tunnel warfare}}
Geologists have been involved in the construction of [[Fortification|forts]], tunnels, and [[bunker]]s both during military conflicts and in peacetime.<ref name="Underwood 1998" /><ref name="Bressan 2009" /> This included digging tunnels in northeastern Italy and Austria during the so-called [[Mines on the Italian Front (World War I)|mine war]] in World War I. The rocks of the [[Dolomites]] are different from those in other theaters and specialists were required in order to design the tunnels. Explosives were then put in the tunnels and detonated, to cause rock falls and undercut enemy troops.<ref name="Bressan 2009">{{Cite web|url=http://historyofgeology.fieldofscience.com/2011/05/war-geology.html|title=War Geology|last=Bressan|first=David|access-date=2019-04-22}}</ref><ref name="Macleod2009">{{cite journal|last1=Macleod|first1=Roy|year=2009|title=' Kriegsgeologen and practical men': military geology and modern memory, 1914–18|journal=The British Journal for the History of Science|volume=28|issue=4|pages=427|doi=10.1017/S0007087400033483|s2cid=131282816 |issn=0007-0874}}</ref>

Geology has been used in many [[military intelligence]] investigations. During World War II, the American [[Military Geology Unit]] discovered the origin of [[Fu-Go balloon bomb|balloon bombs]] which had been dispatched towards North America from Japan. They accomplished this by determining from which beach the sand in the balloon's ballast originated.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://web.mst.edu/~rogersda/forensic_geology/Japenese%20vengenance%20bombs%20new.htm|title=Japanese Vengeance Balloon Bombs of World War II - J.

== Effect of warfare on rocks==
Military activity affects the physical geology. This was first noted through the intensive shelling on the Western Front during World War I, which caused the shattering of the bedrock and changed the rocks' permeability.<ref name="Bressan 2014" /> New minerals, rocks, and [[Sedan Crater|land-forms]] are also a byproduct of nuclear testing.<ref name="Eby 2010" />

== Discoveries by military ==
