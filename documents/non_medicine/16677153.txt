'''Luis Resto''' (born June 11, 1955) is a former Puerto Rican boxer from [[The Bronx]], [[New York (state)|New York]], who was convicted of assault and conspiracy for his part in a cheating scandal.

A journeyman boxer all his career, Resto was convicted in 1986 and jailed for 2 and a half years, for assault, criminal possession of a weapon and conspiracy. Resto had illegally altered his gloves by removing the padding and soaking his hand wraps in plaster in a boxing match against [[Billy Collins Jr.]] This gave Resto an unfair advantage that damaged Collins' eyesight, with Resto giving him a torn iris and permanently blurred vision. Collins was unable to box again after the fight with Resto, and later died in a car crash on March 6th, 1984.<ref name="NY Times">{{cite web |last1=Katz |first1=Michael |title=CRUELEST PUNCHES FOLLOW FIGHTER'S FINAL RING LOSS |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/06/17/sports/cruelest-punches-follow-fighter-s-final-ring-loss.html |website=The New York Times |date=17 June 1984}}</ref>

==Personal life==
Luis Resto was born in [[Juncos, Puerto Rico]], and moved to the [[Bronx]] when he was nine years old. Late in his eighth grade year, he elbowed his math teacher in the face, and spent six months in a rehabilitation center for the mentally disturbed. Not long after getting out, an uncle signed him up for boxing lessons in a Bronx gym.<ref name="SI">[[Jeff Pearlman|Pearlman, Jeff]].

A two-time [[New York (state)|New York]] [[Golden Gloves]] amateur state champion in the [[welterweight]] division, Resto trained at the Police Athletic Leagues Lynch Center.<ref>[http://www.boxrec.com/media/index.php?title=Human:22083 Luis Resto – Boxrec Boxing Encyclopaedia<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> He won both the 1975 and 1976 147 lb Golden Gloves Open Championships. Resto defeated [[Miguel Hernandez (1970s boxer)|Miguel Hernandez]] in the finals of the 1976 147 lb Open Championship.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

==Professional career==

===Early career===
Resto made his professional boxing debut on February 4, 1977 with a points defeat of Julio Chevalier.  He scored his first professional [[knockout]] in his third professional fight, against Mike Lytell in May of the same year. Resto remained unbeaten with a 7-0 record until his eighth bout, a knockout loss to [[Bruce Curry]] in March 1978.

Through 29 fights Resto had compiled a record of 20-8-1, but with only eight wins by knockout, which made him appear to be a light-punching, high-level [[Journeyman (boxing)|journeyman]].<ref name="Luis Resto">[http://www.boxrec.com/list_bouts.php?human_id=22083&cat=boxer Luis Resto<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Although he was ranked 10th in the world, he was practically unknown outside the New York area.<ref name="SI"/>

===Bout with Billy Collins Jr.===
On June 16, 1983 Resto unexpectedly beat undefeated prospect [[Billy Collins Jr.]] at [[Madison Square Garden]] in [[New York City]] in a 10-round unanimous decision. The fight was the [[Card (sports)#Undercard|undercard]] for a bout between [[Roberto Durán]] and [[Davey Moore (1980s)|Davey Moore]].

However, when Collins' father and trainer, Billy Sr., came to shake Resto's hand, he discovered that Resto's gloves felt thinner than normal. Screaming that he thought the gloves had no padding, Collins Sr. demanded that the [[New York State Athletic Commission]] impound the gloves. An investigation revealed that someone had removed an ounce of padding from each of his gloves then filled them with chalk.<ref name="ESPN">{{Cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/sports/boxing/news/story?id=3329115|title=Resto: Wraps were doctored with plaster in fight vs. Collins|date=April 4, 1998|work=ESPN|access-date=August 18, 2018}}</ref> Collins' eyes were swollen shut by the end of the 10th round, and the rest of his face was so badly swollen that it was impossible to believe a light puncher could have inflicted such damage.<ref name="SI"/>

Collins suffered a torn [[Iris (anatomy)|iris]] and permanently blurred vision, ending his career. He died only months later when he drove his car into a [[culvert]] while intoxicated. Some commentators have speculated that the loss of his livelihood drove him into a downward spiral. Collins' father has since speculated that his son committed suicide.<ref>[http://www.secondsout.com/Columns/index.cfm?ccs=788&cs=57112 Margarito’s Situation Brings Back Bad Memories]</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Silver|first=Mike|title=The Ten Dirtiest Fights of All time|journal=The Ring|volume=76| issue =  12|page=48|date=December 1997}}</ref>

After a month's investigation, the New York State Boxing Commission determined that Resto's trainer, [[Panama Lewis]], had removed the padding from Resto's gloves. It also determined that Resto should have known the gloves were illegal. The commission suspended Resto's boxing license for at least a year. Since most state boxing commissions honor sanctions from other states, this effectively banned Resto from boxing in the United States for the duration of the ban.  The commission subsequently changed its rules to prevent anything like what happened to Collins from ever happening again.<ref name="SI"/> Resto's win was subsequently changed to a [[No contest (boxing)|no contest]].<ref name="Luis Resto"/>

In 1986, Lewis and Resto were both put on trial and found guilty of assault, criminal possession of a weapon (Resto's hands) and conspiracy. Prosecutors charged that Resto had to have known the gloves were illegal, and therefore the bout amounted to an illegal 10-round assault. Prosecutors also argued that the plot was centered on a large amount of money bet on Resto by a third party, who had met with Lewis prior to the fight.  Resto served 2 and a half years in prison.<ref name="SI"/>

After 15 years of trying to regain his license, he was finally allowed to work as a [[cornerman]] by New York State.<ref name="SI"/>  For many years, he has lived in an apartment near the gym where he once trained, and has worked with youngsters there as well.<ref name=SweetScience>Mladnich, Robert.

For almost a quarter-century, Resto publicly denied knowing that Lewis had tampered with the gloves.  However, in 2007, Resto apologized to Collins's widow, Andrea Collins-Nile, who attempted to sue the state of New York for not protecting her late husband. Resto also told Collins-Nile that in addition to removing padding from the gloves, Lewis soaked his [[hand wraps]] in [[plaster|plaster of Paris]].  This caused the wraps to harden into [[plaster cast]]s similar to those used to set broken bones, which greatly—and illegally—increased Resto's punching power. The hand wraps have never been confiscated. Resto also disclosed that Lewis would break apart pills used to treat asthma and pour the medicine into his water bottles, giving Resto greater lung capacity in the later rounds of a fight. Resto also visited Collins's gravesite and said, "I'm sorry for what I did to you."<ref name=HBO>{{cite web|url=http://www.hbo.com/events/assaultinthering/index.html|title=HBO: Assault in the Ring|work=hbo.com|date=July 18, 2009|access-date=July 18, 2009}}</ref> At a 2008 press conference, Resto said that he knew Lewis had taken the padding out of his gloves and had done so at least twice before. Resto said he did not protest at the time even though he knew it was wrong. "At the time, I was young," he said. "I went along." Resto was 28 years old at the time of the incident.<ref name=SweetScience/>

The 1983 incident and subsequent aftermath is covered in the [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] documentary ''[[Assault in the Ring]]''.  During this documentary, Resto appeared to confirm law enforcement's theory that the incident was rooted in large bets on him.<ref name=HBO/>
