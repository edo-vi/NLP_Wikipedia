In the [[Eurocode]] series of [[European Committee for Standardization|European standards]] (EN) related to [[construction]], '''''Eurocode 7: Geotechnical design''''' (abbreviated '''EN 1997''' or, informally, '''EC 7''') describes how to design [[geotechnical]] [[structure]]s, using the [[limit state design]] philosophy. It is published in two parts; "General rules" and "Ground investigation and testing". It was approved by the [[European Committee for Standardization]] (CEN) on 12 June 2006. Like other [[Eurocode]]s, it became mandatory in member states in March 2010.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.eurocodes.co.uk/Content.aspx?ContentId=46 |title=eurocodes.co.uk |access-date=2009-09-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090910030713/http://www.eurocodes.co.uk/Content.aspx?ContentId=46 |archive-date=2009-09-10 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Eurocode 7 is intended to:
*be used in conjunction with [[EN 1990]], which establishes the principles and requirements for safety and serviceability, describes the basis of design and verification and gives guidelines for related aspects of structural reliability,
*be applied to the geotechnical aspects of the design of buildings and civil engineering works and it is concerned with the requirements for strength, stability, serviceability and durability of structures.

Eurocode 7 is composed of the following parts

==Part 1: General rules==
EN 1997-1 is intended to be used as a general basis for the geotechnical aspects of the design of buildings and civil engineering works.

===Contents===
* General
* Basis of design
* Geotechnical data
* Supervision of construction, monitoring and maintenance
* Fill, [[dewatering]], ground improvement and reinforcement
* Spread foundations
* [[Deep foundation]] (pile foundations)
* Anchorages
* Retaining structures
* [[Hydraulic failure]]
* Overall stability
* [[wikt:embankment|Embankment]]s

EN 1997-1 is accompanied by Annexes A to J, which provide:
*'''Annex A''' Recommended partial safety factor values; different values of the partial factors may be set by the National annex.
*'''Annexes B to J''' Supplementary informative guidance such as internationally applied calculation methods.

==Part 2: Ground investigation and testing==
EN 1997-2 is intended to be used in conjunction with EN 1997-1 and provides rules supplementary to EN 1997-1 related to planning and reporting of ground investigations, general requirements for a range of commonly used laboratory and field tests, interpretation and evaluation of test results and derivation of values of geotechnical parameters and coefficients.

==Part 3: Design assisted by field testing==
There is no longer a Part 3. It was amalgamated into EN 1997-2
