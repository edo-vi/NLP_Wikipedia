[[File:Moby-Dick FE title page.jpg|thumb|''[[Moby-Dick]]'' by [[Herman Melville]], an example of a "classic book"]]

A '''classic''' is a [[book]] accepted as being exemplary or particularly noteworthy. What makes a book "classic" is a concern that has occurred to various authors ranging from [[Italo Calvino]] to [[Mark Twain]] and the related questions of "Why Read the Classics?" and "What Is a Classic?" have been essayed by authors from different genres and eras (including Calvino, [[T. S. Eliot]], [[Charles Augustin Sainte-Beuve]]).  The ability of a classic book to be reinterpreted, to seemingly be renewed in the interests of generations of readers succeeding its creation, is a theme that is seen in the writings of literary critics including [[Michael Dirda]], [[Ezra Pound]], and Sainte-Beuve. These books can be published as a collection (such as [[Great Books of the Western World]], [[Modern Library]], or [[Penguin Classics]]) or presented as a list, such as [[Harold Bloom]]'s list of books that constitute the [[Western canon]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Bloom, Harold|title= The Western Canon: The Books and School of the Ages|url=https://archive.org/details/westerncanonbook00bloorich|url-access=registration|location= New York|publisher= Harcourt Brace & Company|date= 1994|isbn= 9780151957477}}</ref>  Although the term is often associated with the Western canon, it can be applied to works of literature from all traditions, such as the [[Chinese classics]] or the Indian [[Veda]]s.

Many universities incorporate these readings into their curricula, such as "The Reading List" at [[St. John's College (Annapolis/Santa Fe)|St. John's College]],<ref name="Stjohnscollege.edu">{{cite web|url=http://www.stjohnscollege.edu/academic/readlist.shtml |title=St. John's College &#124; Academic Program &#124; The Reading List |publisher=Stjohnscollege.edu |access-date=2010-06-13 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527090156/http://www.stjohnscollege.edu/academic/readlist.shtml |archive-date=May 27, 2010 }}</ref> [[Rutgers University]],<ref name="rci.rutgers.edu">{{cite web|url=http://rci.rutgers.edu/~wcd/complist.pdf|title=Reading List:Rutgers University Senior Comprehensive Examination|website=Rutgers University|access-date=2010-06-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100621063002/http://www.rci.rutgers.edu/~wcd/complist.pdf|archive-date=2010-06-21|url-status=dead}}</ref> or [[Dharma Realm Buddhist University]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=2022 |title=Reading list for BA course mapped and categorized by different traditions (Western, Chinese, Buddhist, Indian...) |url=https://www.drbu.edu/academics/undergraduate-program/course-work-map |url-status=live |access-date=November 7, 2022 |website=Dharma Realm Buddhist University |language=English|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221107135008/https://www.drbu.edu/academics/undergraduate-program/course-work-map|archive-date=November 7, 2022}}</ref> The study of these classic texts both allows and encourages students to become familiar with some of the most revered authors throughout history.

==History==
In 1850, [[Charles Augustin Sainte-Beuve]] (1804–1869)<ref>Harper, George McLean. ''Charles-Augustin Sainte-Beuve''. Philadelphia: J.B. Lippincott Company, 1909.</ref> stated his answer to the question "What is a Classic?" ("Qu'est-ce qu'un classique?"):<ref>{{Citation

<blockquote>The idea of a classic implies something that has continuance and consistence, and which produces unity and tradition, fashions and transmits itself, and endures.... A true classic, as I should like to hear it defined, is an author who has enriched the human mind, increased its treasure, and caused it to advance a step; who has discovered some moral and not equivocal truth, or revealed some eternal passion in that heart where all seemed known and discovered; who has expressed his thought, observation, or invention, in no matter what form, only provided it be broad and great, refined and sensible, sane and beautiful in itself; who has spoken to all in his own peculiar style, a style which is found to be also that of the whole world, a style new without [[neologism]], new and old, easily contemporary with all time.</blockquote>

[[File:Sainte-Beuve.jpg|thumb|left|Charles Augustin Sainte-Beuve]]
In this same essay, Sainte-Beuve quoted Goethe (referring to the 'classics' concept): "Ancient works are classical not because they are old, but because they are powerful, fresh, and healthy."<ref group="Note">Sainte-Beuve's "What is a Classic" essay was originally published in ''[[Le Constitutionnel]]'' on October 21, 1850, as "Qu'est-ce qu'un classique?—Lundis" ("Monday"), Volume  III, 40. (Stephen Moeller-Sally, "Gogol's afterlife: the evolution of a classic in Imperial and Soviet Russia" [Evanston, Illinois: Northwestern University Press, 2002], p. 168). However it originated, an error regarding the date of Saint-Beauve's "What Is a Classic?" has crept into some sources.  According to historical calendars, <http://arc.id.au/Calendar.html>, Monday, October 21 had to be the in 1850, '''not''' 1860. The year is erroneously stated as 1860 in A. Pichon's edition of Saint Beuve's work in "Causeries Du Lundi Et Portraits Littraires" (republished in 2009 in its entirety by [[BiblioBazaar|BiblioBazaar/BiblioLife, LLC]]).</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/32/1002.html |title=Introductory Note.

The concept of 'the classic' was a theme of [[T.S. Eliot]]'s literary criticism as well. In [[The Sacred Wood (T.S. Eliot)|''The Sacred Wood'']] he thought that one of the reasons "Dante is a classic, and Blake only a poet of genius was" because of "the concentration resulting from a framework of mythology and theology and philosophy".<ref>Eliot, T.S. ''The Sacred Wood''. Mineola, NY. Dover Publications, 1920, Page 92</ref> (In commenting about Eliot's influence, Professor Jan Gorak stated that "the idea of a canon has become intertwined with the idea of the classic, an idea that T.S. Eliot tried to revitalize for the 'modern experiment'".)<ref>Gorak, Jan. ''The Making of the Modern Canon''. New Jersey/United Kingdom. Athlone Press Limited, 1991, Page 253</ref> In echoes of Sainte-Beuve, Eliot gave a speech to the Virgil Society concerning himself with the very same question of "What is a Classic?"<ref>Eliot, T.S. Address to the Virgil Society on October 16, 1944; first published by Faber & Faber, 1945, presently available in: ''Selected Prose of T. S. Eliot''. New York. Houghton Mifflin Harcourt/Farrar, Straus, Giroux.1975</ref> In his opinion, there was only one author who was 'classic': "No modern language can hope to produce a classic, in the sense I have called Virgil a classic. Our classic, the classic of all Europe, is Virgil."<ref>Eliot, ''Selected Prose''. Page 130</ref> In this instance, though, Eliot said that the word had different meanings in different surroundings and that his concern was with "one meaning in one context". He states his focus is to define only "one kind of art" and that it does not have to be "better...than another kind". His opening paragraph makes a clear distinction between his particular meaning of classic having Virgil as the classic of all literature and the alternate meaning of classic as "a standard author".<ref>Eliot, ''Selected Prose''. Pages 115–116</ref>

Literary figures from different eras have also weighed in on the matter. [[Alan Bennett]], the modern English playwright and author, said that "Definition of a classic: a book everyone is assumed to have read and often thinks they have read themselves."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0003141/bio|title=Alan Bennett|website=IMDb}}</ref>{{Better source needed|date=May 2022}} [[Mark Van Doren]], the [[Columbia University]] professor and poet, is quoted by [[Jim Trelease]] (in his library-monograph ''Classic Picture Books All Children Should Experience''), as saying that "A classic is any book that stays in print".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.trelease-on-reading.com/classic-picturebooks.pdf|title=Classic Picture Books Every Child Should Experience}}</ref> And in his "Disappearance of Literature" speech given in 1900, [[Mark Twain]] said (referring to a learned academic's lofty opinion of Milton's ''[[Paradise Lost]]'') that the work met the Professor's definition of a classic as "something that everybody wants to have read and nobody wants to read".<ref>Twain, ''Mark Twain's Speeches'', Page 194</ref>

In 1920, Fannie M. Clark, a teacher at the Rozelle School in East Cleveland, Ohio, predates Calvino's similar conclusions by 60 years when she also essayed the question of what makes a book a "classic" in her article "Teaching Children to Choose" in ''The [[English Journal]]''.<ref name=clark136>{{Cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f_sRAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA135 |title=Teaching children to choose|author=Fannie Clark|year=1920|journal=The English Journal|volume=9|issue=3|pages=135&ndash;138|doi=10.2307/802644|jstor=802644}}</ref> Over the course of her essay, Clark considers the question of what makes a piece of literature a classic and why the idea of "the classics" is important to society as a whole. Clark says that "teachers of English have been so long trained in the 'classics' that these 'classics' have become to them very much like the Bible, for the safety of which the rise of modern science causes such unnecessary fears."<ref name="clark136" /> She goes on to say that among the sources she consulted was a group of eighth-graders when she asked them the question: "What do you understand by the classics in literature?" Two of the answers Clark received were "Classics are books your fathers give you and you keep them to give to your children" and "Classics are those great pieces of literature considered worthy to be studied in English classes of high school or college". Calvino agrees with the Ohio educator when he states "Schools and universities ought to help us understand that no book that talks about a book says more than the book in question, but instead they do their level best to make us think the opposite."  Clark and Calvino come to a similar conclusion that when a literary work is analyzed for what makes it 'classic', that in just the act of analysis or as Clark says "the anatomical dissection",<ref name="clark136" /> the reader can end up destroying the unique pleasure that mere enjoyment a work of literature can hold.

Classics are often defined in terms of their lasting freshness. [[Clifton Fadiman]] thought that the works that become classic books have their start in childhood, saying that "If you wish to live long in the memory of men, you should not write for them at all. You should write what their children will enjoy."<ref>Fadiman, Clifton.''Party of One, The Selected Writings of Clifton Fadiman'' New York. World Publishing. 1955. Page 387</ref> In his view, the works we now judge to be classics are "great starters". Fadiman unites classic books through the ages in a continuum (and concurs with Goethe's thoughts on the vigour and relevance of the ancient [[Classics]]), when he states that classic books share a "quality of beginningness" with the legendary writer of the ''[[Iliad]]'' and the ''[[Odyssey]]'' – [[Homer]] himself.<ref>Fadiman,''Party of One'', Page 42</ref>  [[Ezra Pound]] in his own tome on reading, ''[[ABC of Reading]]'', gave his opinion when he stated, "A classic is classic not because it conforms to certain structural rule, or fits certain definitions (of which its author had quite probably never heard).  It is classic because of a certain eternal and irrepressible freshness."<ref>[[ABC of Reading]], Volume 0-151, New York: New Directions (2010, ©1934). Pages 13–14</ref> [[Michael Dirda]], the 1993 [[Pulitzer Prize]] winning critic, concurred with Pound's view regarding the vitality of a classic when he wrote that "...one of the true elements of a classic" was that "they can be read again and again with ever-deepening pleasure."<ref>Dirda, Michael. ''Bound to Please''. New York. W.W. Norton & Company. 2005. Page 182</ref>

In the 1980s, [[Italo Calvino]] said in his essay "Why Read the Classics?" that "a classic is a book that has never finished saying what it has to say" and comes to the crux of personal choice in this matter when he says (italics in the original translation): "{{em|Your}} classic author is the one you cannot feel indifferent to, who helps you define yourself in relation to him, even in dispute with him."<ref group="Note">The essay "Why Read the Classics?" is available in two different anthologies.  It was first published in 1980/82 in the Italian as a chapter in "The Uses of Literature" (in 1986 in the English translation) and then re-published in the posthumous collection titled "Why Read the Classics?"</ref><ref>{{citation

</ref> Consideration of what makes a literary work a classic is for Calvino ultimately a personal choice, and, constructing a universal definition of what constitutes a Classic Book seems to him to be an impossibility, since, as Calvino says "There is nothing for it but for all of us to invent our own ideal libraries of classics."<ref>Calvino, ''The Uses of Literature: Essays'', Page 133</ref>

While blogging on the website [[guardian.co.uk]] in 2009, Chris Cox echoes Twain's "classic" sentiments of 1900 and Bennett's witticism about classic books when he opined on the Guardian.Co "Books Blog" that there are actually two kinds of "classic novels": <blockquote>The first are those we know we should have read, but probably have not. These are generally the books that make us burn with shame when they come up in conversation... The second kind, meanwhile, are those books that we've read five times, can quote from on any occasion, and annoyingly push on to other people with the words: "You have to read this. It's a classic."<ref>{{cite news|last=Cox |first=Chris |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2009/dec/08/classic-novel-new-york-review |title=The other kind of classic novel|work=Guardian |date= 2009-12-08|access-date=2010-06-13 | location=London}}</ref></blockquote>

"Classic Books" reading lists are used at some universities<ref name="Stjohnscollege.edu"/><ref name="rci.rutgers.edu"/> have been in modern vogue since at least the early part of the 20th century, with the additional impetus in 1909 of the [[Harvard Classics]] publishing imprimatur having individual works chosen by outgoing [[Harvard University]] president [[Charles W.

In 1920, [[John Erskine (educator)|John Erskine]] taught the first course based on the "Great Books" program, titled "General Honors", at [[Columbia University]], and helped shape its core curriculum.<ref name="faculty">{{cite web |title= An Oasis of Order: The Core Curriculum at Columbia College:Faculty Profiles:John Erskine|url=http://www.college.columbia.edu/core/oasis/profiles/erskine.php |publisher=Columbia College |access-date=27 June 2013}}</ref><ref name=col>{{cite web |title=The Beginnings of the Great Books Movement at Columbia |url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/alumni/Magazine/Winter2001/greatBooks.html |date=Winter 2001 |publisher=Columbia Magazine |access-date=27 June 2013}}</ref> The course, however, initially began to fail shortly after its introduction due to numerous disputes between senior faculty over the best way to conduct classes, as well as concerns about the rigor of the courses. This resulted in junior faculty, including [[Mark Van Doren]] and [[Mortimer Adler]] after 1923, teaching parts of the course. The course was discontinued in 1928, though later reinstated. Adler left for the [[University of Chicago]] in 1929, where he continued his work on the theme, and along with the university president, [[Robert M. Hutchins]], held an annual seminar of great books with he later reworked into The ''[[Great Books of the Western World]]''. University trustee and Chicago businessman [[Walter Paepcke]] was inspired by the seminar to found the [[Aspen Institute]]. In 1937, when Mark Van Doren redesigned the course, it was already being taught at [[St. John's College, Annapolis]], in addition to the University of Chicago. This course was later named Humanities A for freshmen, and then subsequently evolved into Literature Humanities.<ref name=col/>  

[[Core Curriculum (Columbia College)|Columbia's Core Curriculum]], the Common Core at Chicago, and the Core Curriculum at [[Boston University]], each heavily focused on the "great books" of the Western canon, are prominent examples of Classic Books programs that the majority of enrolled students participate. Fordham University's Honors Program at Rose Hill incorporates the Great Books curriculum into a rigorous first four semesters in the program. Loyola University Chicago's Honors Program combines a Great Books curriculum with additional elective classes on subjects not covered in traditional Western thought over a rigorous four-year program.<ref>{{cite web |title=Course Description LUC.EDU |url=https://www.luc.edu/honors/coursesandcurriculum/coursedescriptions/}}</ref> Over 100 institutions of higher learning in the United States, [[Great Books programs in Canada|Canada]], and Europe maintain some version of a Great Books Program as an option for students.<ref>{{cite web|last=Casement|first=William|title=College Great Books Programs|url=http://www.coretexts.org/college-great-books-programs/#tz|publisher=The Association for Core Texts and Courses (ACTC)|access-date=29 May 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121116234705/http://www.coretexts.org/college-great-books-programs/#tz|archive-date=16 November 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In addition, a handful of colleges offer a major whose pedagogy is structured around the Great Books. The [[University of Notre Dame]]'s Program of Liberal Studies, established in 1950, and housed in the College of Liberals Arts, the Integral Program<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Integral Program of Liberal Arts: A Great Books Curriculum |url=https://www.stmarys-ca.edu/the-integral-program-of-liberal-arts-a-great-books-program |website=Saint Mary's College}}</ref> at [[Saint Mary's College of California]] (1955), and the Bachelor of Humanities program offered by the College of the Humanities at [[Carleton University]] in Ottawa (1995) are three such examples. 

Despite the prevalence of Great Books style courses and majors at a number of universities, there are only a few colleges that teach their curriculum exclusively through the Great Books model . The first, and most well known, of these schools is [[St. John's College (Annapolis/Santa Fe)#Great Books program|St. John's College]] in Annapolis (1937) and Santa Fe (1964);<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stjohnscollege.edu/academic/readlist.shtml |title=St. John's College &#124; Academic Program &#124; The Reading List |publisher=Stjohnscollege.edu |access-date=9 November 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527090156/http://www.stjohnscollege.edu/academic/readlist.shtml |archive-date=27 May 2010 }}</ref> it was followed by [[Shimer College|Shimer Great Books School]] (1950) in Naperville, Illinois, [[Thomas Aquinas College]] in Santa Paula, California (est. 1971), [[Thomas More College of Liberal Arts]] in Merrimack, New Hampshire (est. 1978), and [[Magdalen College of the Liberal Arts]] in Warner, New Hampshire. More recent schools with this type of curriculum include [[New Saint Andrews College]] in Moscow, Idaho (est. 1994), [[Gutenberg College]] in Eugene, Oregon (est. 1994), [[Harrison Middleton University]] in Tempe, Arizona (est. 1998), and [[Wyoming Catholic College]] in Lander, Wyoming (est. 2005). [[Dharma Realm Buddhist University]] is the first Great Books school to offer curriculum combining Eastern and Western classics.<ref name="drbu.org">{{cite web |title=Dharma Realm Buddhist University Accepting Applications for Undergraduate Program |url=http://www.drbu.org/news/dharma-realm-buddhist-university-accepting-applications-undergraduate-program |access-date=10 August 2016 |website=Dharma Realm Buddhist University}}</ref>

[[Publishing|Publishing houses]] (e.g., [[Easton Press]], [[The Franklin Mint#The Franklin Library|Franklin Library]], and [[Folio Society]]) and colleges/universities (such as [[Oxford University Press]] and [[Yale University Press]]) frequently publish collections of classic books. Publishers have their various types of "classic book" lines, while colleges and universities have required reading lists as well as associated publishing interests. If these books are the works of literature that well-read people are supposed to have read or at least be familiar with, then the genesis of the classic book genre and the processes through which texts are considered for selection (or not) is of interest. The development of the Penguin Classics line of books, among the best-known of the classic imprints, can serve as a good example.

[[Penguin Books]], the parent company of [[Penguin Classics]], had its inception during the 1930s when the founder, [[Allen Lane]], was unable to find a book he actually wanted to read while at [[Exeter]] train station.  As the company website tells it, "appalled by the selection on offer, Lane decided that good quality contemporary fiction should be made available at an attractive price and sold not just in traditional bookshops, but also in railway stations, [[tobacconists]] and [[chain stores]]<ref name = pingu>{{cite web

In 1954 Mortimer Adler hosted a live weekly television series in San Francisco, comprising 52 half-hour programs, entitled ''The Great Ideas''. These programs were produced by Adler's Institute for Philosophical Research and were carried as a public service by the [[American Broadcasting Company]], presented by [[National Educational Television]], the precursor to what is now [[PBS]]. Adler bequeathed these films to the Center for the Study of the Great Ideas, where they are available for purchase.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thegreatideas.org/mortimer_adler_videos/index.html|title=Mortimer Adler Videos on The Great Ideas|website=www.thegreatideas.org}}</ref>

In 1993 and 1994, The [[Learning Channel]] created [[The Learning Channel's Great Books|a series of one-hour programs]] discussing many of the Great Books of history and their impact on the world. It was narrated by [[Donald Sutherland]] and [[Morgan Freeman]], among others.
