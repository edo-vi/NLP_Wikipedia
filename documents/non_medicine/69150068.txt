==Factors==
Achieving control of a disease (such as COVID-19) requires not only developing and licensing vaccines but also producing them at scale, pricing them so that they are globally affordable, allocating them to be available where and when they are needed, and deploying them to local communities.  An effective global approach to achieving vaccine equity must address challenges in the dimensions of vaccine production, allocation, affordability, and deployment.<ref name="Yamey"/><ref name="Wouters">{{cite journal |last1=Wouters |first1=Olivier J. |last2=Shadlen |first2=Kenneth C. |last3=Salcher-Konrad |first3=Maximilian |last4=Pollard |first4=Andrew J. |last5=Larson |first5=Heidi J. |last6=Teerawattananon |first6=Yot |last7=Jit |first7=Mark |title=Challenges in ensuring global access to COVID-19 vaccines: production, affordability, allocation, and deployment |journal=Lancet |date=13 March 2021 |volume=397 |issue=10278 |pages=1023–1034 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(21)00306-8 |pmid=33587887 |pmc=7906643 |issn=1474-547X}}</ref>

[[Doctors Without Borders]] (MSF) lists five major obstacles to vaccine equity, taking into account that many of those to be vaccinated are children:<ref name="MSF_vac"/>
* Vaccine prices; new vaccines are on-patent and expensive (affordability)
* Getting vaccines to children; this is expensive and gets even more difficult in conflict zones and natural disasters (affordability, deployment)
* Five clinic visits in the first year of life is often too many; for people in remote areas with many children, it can be much more costly and difficult to get to a clinic. (deployment)
* Keeping vaccines cold; see [[cold chain]]. (deployment)
* Age-out; children who don't get vaccinated on-schedule often have to pay for their shots. Disruption from natural disasters or conflict can mean that entire generations go unprotected.(affordability, deployment)

Achieving vaccine equity depends on having a sufficient supply of affordable vaccines available for global use.
Ideally, a vaccine that is suitable for global use will be based on established technology; will have multiple available suppliers of the materials and equipment needed for production; be appropriate to the regions where it is to be produced or deployed, in terms of scalability of production and storage conditions; and be supported by local infrastructure for its production, delivery and regulation.<ref name="Holmes"/>

=== Vaccine affordability ===
A major factor in the [[economics of vaccines]] is [[intellectual property law]]. IP currently operates by granting pharmaceutical monopolies lasting decades. The economics of [[monopoly power]] give the monopolist a strong financial incentive to use [[value-based pricing]] and set prices that many, often most, potential customers can't afford (a [[pricing strategy]] that charges what the market will bear, unlike traditional [[cost-plus pricing]] charges the cost of production plus a markup). [[Price discrimination]] attempts to charge each person the maximum they would be willing to pay, and charges every purchaser more than they would be charged in a fully-competitive market. A vaccine monopolist has no incentive to let the rich actually subsidize the poor. Medical-product monopolists may claim that the high prices charged to the rich subsidize the lower prices charged to the poor when in fact both are being charged well over independent estimates of the [[cost of production]] (see, for instance, [[Cepheid (company)#Pricing controversy|GeneXpert cartridges]] and [[GAVI#Pneumococcal vaccine|pneumococcal vaccine]]).{{citation needed|date=March 2022}}

[[Amnesty International]], [[Oxfam#Oxfam International|Oxfam International]], and [[Médecins Sans Frontières]] (MSF; Doctors without Borders)  have criticized government support of some vaccine monopolies, on the grounds that the monopolies dramatically increase prices and impair vaccine equity.<ref>{{cite press release |title=G7 support for pharma monopolies is putting millions of lives at risk |date=10 June 2021 |publisher=Amnesty International |url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/press-release/2021/06/g7-support-for-pharma-monopolies-putting-millions-of-lives-at-risk/ |access-date=20 August 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite press release |title=Vaccine monopolies make cost of vaccinating the world against COVID at least 5 times more expensive than it could be |date=29 July 2021 |publisher=Oxfam International |url=https://www.oxfam.org/en/press-releases/vaccine-monopolies-make-cost-vaccinating-world-against-covid-least-5-times-more |access-date=20 August 2021}}</ref><ref name="no_patents"/> During the COVID-19 pandemic, there were calls for COVID-related IP to be suspended, using the [[TRIPS Waiver]].

=== Vaccine production ===
Low and middle income countries tend to lack technological expertise and manufacturing capacity for the production of drugs and medical products.  This leaves them dependent on diagnostics, treatments and vaccines from manufacturers in other countries and on availability in the global market.  There are some exceptions such as China, Cuba, and India, which are actively producing pharmaceuticals to internationally accepted standards.<ref name="Zhan"/><ref name="Holmes"/>

The COVID-19 pandemic has led to recommendations to diversify pharmaceutical production and  increase the productive ability of LMICs. This could enable those countries to better ensure that their own production needs are being met, which would help to achieve global vaccine equity.<ref name="Zhan"/><ref name="Maxmen">{{cite journal |last1=Maxmen |first1=Amy |title=The fight to manufacture COVID vaccines in lower-income countries |journal=Nature |date=15 September 2021 |volume=597 |issue=7877 |pages=455–457 |doi=10.1038/d41586-021-02383-z |pmid=34526695 |bibcode=2021Natur.597..455M |s2cid=237534530 |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-02383-z |access-date=3 May 2022 |language=en}}</ref>

* Availability of capital, technology and skills
* Adherence to quality standards
* Inconsistent or unsupportive national and international policy frameworks
* Size of markets, purchasing power, and variable demand for vaccines
* Lack of national or local infrastructure (e.g. reliable energy, electricity, transportation)

Even when organizations are willing to share their information, [[knowledge transfer]] can create serious delays for the production of vaccines.  This may be particularly true in the case of novel technologies.<ref name="Maxmen"/>  LMICs may be better situated to produce vaccines that are based on more established technologies, if those are available.<ref name="Holmes">{{cite journal |last1=Holmes |first1=Bob |title=Vaccinating the world against Covid-19 |journal=Knowable Magazine |date=18 April 2022 |doi=10.1146/knowable-041822-1|doi-access=free |url=https://knowablemagazine.org/article/health-disease/2022/vaccinating-world-against-covid19 |access-date=3 May 2022}}</ref><ref name="Hotez"/>

=== Vaccine allocation ===
In the absence of well-organized systems to develop and distribute vaccines,
vaccine companies and high income nations may monopolize available resources.
Organizations such as [[GAVI]],
the [[Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations]],
and the World Health Organization have proposed multilateral initiatives such as [[Covax]] for the improvement of vaccine allocation. The intention with Covax was to collectively pool resources to ensure vaccine development and production.  The resulting vaccine supplies could be fairly distributed to reach less wealthy countries and achieve vaccine equity.

It has been suggested that initiatives for vaccine allocation and vaccine equity could be improved by increasing the simplicity, transparency and accountability of their mechanisms.<ref name="Antoine"/> Others argue that such a body needs high-level leadership that is able to act at political and diplomatic levels to address issues of [[vaccine diplomacy]] as well as streamlining its mechanisms.<ref name="Lancet"/>

The allocation of vaccines and the issue of wastage are related. When high income countries buy more than they use, doses go to waste. If higher income countries donate near-expiration doses to lower income countries, those doses may expire before they can be effectively reallocated and used. This type of closed vial wastage could be reduced, through the improvement of supply chain management within countries, the internationally coordinated monitoring and tracking of  vaccines, and well-organized systems for the timely donation and reallocation of surplus vaccines.<ref name="Lazarus"/>

Open vial wastage, which occurs when only part of a vial of vaccine is used, could also be reduced.  Strategies include making less doses available in a single vial, and organizing appointments to more effectively ensure that doses are used by overbooking (since some people will not appear) or not booking (so that only those who do appear receive doses).<ref name="Lazarus">{{cite journal |last1=Lazarus |first1=Jeffrey V. |last2=Karim |first2=Salim S.

=== Vaccine deployment ===
Barriers to deployment may be both physical and mental.<ref name="Tibbetts"/> In addition to supply and demand, barriers to immunization can include systems barriers related to organization of the health care system; health care provider barriers relating to availability and education of health care staff; and patient barriers around a parent or patient's fears or beliefs about immunization.<ref name="Anderson"/>

To achieve vaccine equity, vaccine development needs to prioritize concerns about whether a vaccine can survive outside a fridge or be administered in a single shot.<ref name=nat>{{cite web |title=Global vaccine plan draws criticism |url=http://blogs.nature.com/news/2012/05/doctors-without-borders-lambastes-global-vaccine-plan.html |website=Nature News Blog }}</ref> 

{{quote|“It’s important to figure out who are the most marginalized people living in your area. ... How can you make the vaccine easy for them to get? That is what vaccine equity looks like.”<ref name="Tibbetts">{{cite journal |last1=Tibbetts |first1=John H. |title=How to convince people to accept a Covid-19 vaccine |journal=Knowable Magazine |date=31 March 2021 |doi=10.1146/knowable-033121-1 |s2cid=235519415 |url=https://knowablemagazine.org/article/health-disease/2021/how-to-convince-people-to-accept-covid19-vaccine |access-date=3 May 2022}}</ref>}}

To reach communities and successfully deploy a vaccine and achieve vaccine equity, it is important to take a “human-centered” public health approach that can address and respond to the concerns of local individuals and organizations. For example, vaccines could be made available by going to where people live, and partnering with houses of worship and other community centers, rather than relying on people to travel to hospitals or doctor's offices.<ref name="Tibbetts"/> In [[Laos]], measures taken included repairing roads to remote areas, buying vans with modern refrigeration to transport vaccines, and visiting residences, temples, and schools to discuss the importance of vaccination.<ref name="Laos">{{cite web |title=The impact of COVAX in Laos |url=https://www.gavi.org/vaccineswork/impact-covax-laos |website=GAVI |access-date=4 May 2022 |language=en}}</ref>

As part of Laos' public health campaign, President [[Thongloun Sisoulith]] was publicly vaccinated, on television, to encourage others to follow his example.<ref name="Laos"/> Working with leaders and trusted community members within communities who can present important information and  publicly identify and counter misinformation can be very successful. This type of approach was used in India, which was certified as free of [[poliomyelitis]] in 2014. In that public health campaign, 98% of the “social mobilizers”  involved were women, whose involvement was critical.<ref name="Tibbetts"/><ref name="SIDDIQUE">{{cite journal |last1=Rahman Siddique |first1=Anisur |last2=Singh |first2=Prem |last3=Trived |first3=Geetali |title=Role of Social Mobilization (Network) in Polio Eradication in India |journal=Indian Pediatrics |date=August 15, 2014 |volume=53, Supplement 1 |pages=s50–s56 |url=https://indianpediatrics.net/supplaug2016/s50.pdf |access-date=3 May 2022}}</ref>

===Vaccine messaging===
Communicating about public health risks is more effective when a message involves three or four specific talking points, which are then backed up with evidence. An initial message may focus on what is happening, what to do, and how to do it, followed up by details and how to find more information.<ref name="Bob"/>

Part of effective communication is to avoid confusing or overwhelming people. A simple message can be followed by more complex ones.  Messages should be clear about the limits of what is known: explicitly identifying the boundaries of evolving knowledge rather than speculating and sending out conflicting and confusing messages.<ref name="Bob">{{cite journal |last1=Holmes |first1=Bob |title=Speaking of pandemics: The art and science of risk communication |journal=Knowable Magazine |date=9 July 2020 |doi=10.1146/knowable-070920-1 |s2cid=225779974 |url=https://knowablemagazine.org/article/health-disease/2020/speaking-pandemics-art-and-science-risk-communication |access-date=3 May 2022}}</ref>

Often, the most useful and effective communication comes from local officials and people with expertise who know their community and the issue involved well.<ref name="Bob"/>
It is important to be aware of and address issues such as medical disparities, abuse, neglect, and [[disinformation]] that may affect communities. Disinformation tends to thrive under conditions of confusion, distrust and disenfranchisement. Countering disinformation is not just a matter of presenting facts and figures. People need to feel heard and their concerns need to be considered.<ref name="Tibbetts"/>

=== Migrant populations ===
Migrants and refugees arriving and living in Europe face various difficulties in getting vaccinated and many of them are not fully vaccinated. People arriving from Africa, Eastern Europe, the Eastern Mediterranean, and Asia are more likely to be under-vaccinated (partial or delayed vaccination). Also, recently arrived [[refugee]]s, [[Migrant worker|migrants]] and [[Asylum seeker|seekers of asylum]] were less likely to be fully vaccinated than other people from the same groups. Those with little contact to healthcare services, no citizenship and lower income are also more likely to be under-vaccinated.<ref name=":03">{{Cite journal |date=2022-12-20 |title=How to increase vaccination uptake among migrant communities |url=https://evidence.nihr.ac.uk/alert/how-to-increase-vaccination-uptake-migrant-communities/ |journal=NIHR Evidence |language=en |doi=10.3310/nihrevidence_55367}}</ref><ref name=":13">{{Cite journal |last=Crawshaw |first=Alison F |last2=Farah |first2=Yasmin |last3=Deal |first3=Anna |last4=Rustage |first4=Kieran |last5=Hayward |first5=Sally E |last6=Carter |first6=Jessica |last7=Knights |first7=Felicity |last8=Goldsmith |first8=Lucy P |last9=Campos-Matos |first9=Ines |last10=Wurie |first10=Fatima |last11=Majeed |first11=Azeem |last12=Bedford |first12=Helen |last13=Forster |first13=Alice S |last14=Hargreaves |first14=Sally |date=September 2022 |title=Defining the determinants of vaccine uptake and undervaccination in migrant populations in Europe to improve routine and COVID-19 vaccine uptake: a systematic review |url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1473309922000664 |journal=The Lancet Infectious Diseases |language=en |volume=22 |issue=9 |pages=e254–e266 |doi=10.1016/S1473-3099(22)00066-4 |pmc=9007555 |pmid=35429463}}</ref>
