'''Equine multinodular pulmonary fibrosis''' is a chronic [[lung disease]] of horses. There is evidence that the disease is caused by infection with a [[gammaherpesvirus]], [[equine herpesvirus 5]]. The disease affects usually adult horses reducing the ability to exercise as a result of the formation of nodular lesions in the lungs.<ref name="Williams2014">{{cite journal | vauthors = Williams KJ | title = Gammaherpesviruses and pulmonary fibrosis: evidence from humans, horses, and rodents | journal = Veterinary Pathology | volume = 51 | issue = 2 | pages = 372–84 | date = March 2014 | pmid = 24569614 | doi = 10.1177/0300985814521838 | s2cid = 22704874 }}</ref>

== Signs and symptoms ==
Signs of equine multinodular pulmonary fibrosis are mainly weight loss, fever, respiratory distress and depression. <ref name=":0">{{cite journal | vauthors = Poth T, Niedermaier G, Hermanns W | s2cid = 2795321 | title = Equine multinodular pulmonary fibrosis in association with an EHV-5 infection in 5 horses. | journal = Wiener Tierärztliche Monatsschrift | date = January 2009 | volume = 96 | issue = 7/8 | pages = 203–8 }}</ref><ref name=":1">{{cite journal | vauthors = Marenzoni ML, Passamonti F, Lepri E, Cercone M, Capomaccio S, Cappelli K, Felicetti M, Coppola G, Coletti M, Thiry E | display-authors = 6 | title = Quantification of Equid herpesvirus 5 DNA in clinical and necropsy specimens collected from a horse with equine multinodular pulmonary fibrosis | journal = Journal of Veterinary Diagnostic Investigation | volume = 23 | issue = 4 | pages = 802–6 | date = July 2011 | pmid = 21908328 | doi = 10.1177/1040638711407890 | doi-access = free }}</ref> Unwillingness to move, mild cough and intermittent tachypnea have been reported.<ref name=":2">{{cite journal | vauthors = Back H, Kendall A, Grandón R, Ullman K, Treiberg-Berndtsson L, Ståhl K, Pringle J | title = Equine multinodular pulmonary fibrosis in association with asinine herpesvirus type 5 and equine herpesvirus type 5: a case report | journal = Acta Veterinaria Scandinavica | volume = 54 | issue = 1 | pages = 57 | date = September 2012 | pmid = 23009194 | pmc = 3511884 | doi = 10.1186/1751-0147-54-57 }}</ref> When the disease progresses, the general condition of the horse usually deteriorates, showing possible signs as severe dyspnea, hypoxemia or nasal discharge. <ref name=":2" /><ref name=":1" />

== Diagnosis ==
Generally EMPF has been categorized as an uncommon disease in horses with idiopathic in origin. Comparing to other interstitial fibrosing lung diseases in horses, the lesions in EMPF differ remarkably due to their nodular pattern.<ref name=":0" /> In histologic examinations, a sharp border may be discerned between the fibrotic and intact lung tissue.<ref name=":3">{{cite journal | vauthors = Williams KJ, Maes R, Del Piero F, Lim A, Wise A, Bolin DC, Caswell J, Jackson C, Robinson NE, Derksen F, Scott MA, Uhal BD, Li X, Youssef SA, Bolin SR | display-authors = 6 | title = Equine multinodular pulmonary fibrosis: a newly recognized herpesvirus-associated fibrotic lung disease | journal = Veterinary Pathology | volume = 44 | issue = 6 | pages = 849–62 | date = November 2007 | pmid = 18039898 | doi = 10.1354/vp.44-6-849 | doi-access =  }}</ref> Integrative fact among horses with EMPF has been frequently established to be an infection of EHV-5. Diagnosis is based on the PCR results and pathomorphological findings from lungs.<ref name=":0" /> The disease has been reported as part of the granumalomatous process in an apparent silicate pneumoconiosis. <ref name=":3" /> Among horses with diagnosed EMPF, thoracic radiography have shown several changes. Generalized mixed interstitial and nodular pattern in the lung parenchyma, <ref name=":2" /> large radiodense opacity in the caudodorsal area of the lung <ref name=":0" /> and thickened peribronchial walls.<ref name=":1" /> Thoracic ultrasonography have demonstrated a bilaterally generalized pleural roughening, several comet tails and multiple, hyperechogenic scattered areas.<ref name=":1" />

== Pathology findings ==
Based on a study of 5 horses by T. POTH, G. NIEDERMAIER and W. HERMANNS (2009) as well as on a study of 24 horses investigated by WILLIAMS et al. (2007), there are significant pathomorphological findings in lungs with equine multinodular pulmonary fibrosis. In gross findings can be noticed pulmonary induration in all lung lobes as well as lesions restricted to the lungs and the bronchiolar lymph nodes. The distribution between two patterns can be seen as a large, whitish until tan and firm nodules of fibrosis. There are noticed histological findings, such as fibrosis and inflammation in different stages and degrees. In alveolies accumulation of neutrophils can be identified, and enlarged, vacuolated macrophages with several multinucleated giant cells. In addition hypertrophy of type II pneumocytes, formation on abnormal cystic airspaces and viral eosinophilic intranuclear inclusion bodies in intraluminal macrophages.<ref name=":0" />

== Treatment and prognosis ==
Different treatments have been experimented with horses diagnosed EMPF, but the prognosis of EMPF is tentative to unfavourable.<ref name=":0" />
