These infections can be found in the genital and respiratory tracks of avian species (chickens and turkey). ''Ureaplasma gallorale'' infections cannot always be managed by the host due to the mechanisms the bacteria have adapted. A host will release immune signals of IgA molecules to the bacterial cells to signify infection but the ''Ureaplasmas'' can secrete an enzyme known as IgAse that destroys IgA, rendering the signal inactive and leaving the host susceptible to health concerns.<ref name=":0" /> These infections, known as the condition Ureaplasmosis, have further ramifications for the barnyard fowl such as low egg production, weight loss, reduced feed conversion efficiency and even death.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Yadaz|first1=S.S.|last2=Singh|first2=U.M.|date=2018|title=Sero-prevalence of mycoplasmosis in poultry in Badbhanjyang, Kathmandu, Nepal|journal=Nepalese Journal of Agricultural Sciences|volume=17|pages=78–84}}</ref> These health issues are a serious concern in maintaining adequate production for the agricultural industry.{{cn|date=September 2022}}
__TOC__
==Classification==
All species of ''Ureaplasma'' appear as gram-negative bacteria that utilize the hydrolysis or urea to produce energy for growth.<ref name=":1" /> Products of urea hydrolysis include carbon dioxide and ammonia. This reaction is coordinated by the enzyme urease, which ''Ureaplasma'' species potently secrete. Unlike most microorganisms, species of ''Ureaplasma'' lack a cell wall. ''Ureaplasma gallorale'' is further characterized as appearing only in avian species. In an experimental study, they found the 16s rDNA sequence for ''Ureaplasma galllorale'' was not able to be amplified by the same PCR primers used to amplify mammalian ''Ureaplasma'' species, suggesting a genetic differentiation in these sequences.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Harasawa|first1=Ryò|last2=Cassell|first2=Gail H.|date=1996|title=Phylogenetic Analysis of Genes Coding for 16S rRNA in Mammalian Ureaplasmas|journal=International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology|volume=46|issue=3|pages=827–829|doi=10.1099/00207713-46-3-827|pmid=8782697|issn=1466-5026|doi-access=free}}</ref> The genome size is indicative of the organisms complete reliance on the compounds produced from the host. The ''Ureaplasma gallorale'' species, along with the other ''Ureaplasma'' species, are missing key biological pathways due to their small genomes but survive through absorption of the compounds found in their microenvironment.{{cn|date=September 2022}}
