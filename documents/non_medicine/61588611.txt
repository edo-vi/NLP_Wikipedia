'''Metamorphic series''' include the '''Barrovian''' and '''Buchan''' series of [[metamorphic rock]]s. [[George Barrow (geologist)|George Barrow]] was a geologist in Scotland who discovered the Barrovian series.<ref> {{cite web|url=https://www.tulane.edu/~sanelson/eens212/regionalmetamorph.htm |title= Regional metamorphism |publisher=Tulane University|access-date= 23 August 2019}}</ref> These are also called '''metamorphic facies series'''. A [[metamorphic facies]] series is a sequence of metamorphic facies which plot in a temperature-pressure diagram along a line, and this line represents a certain geothermal gradient. They are not the same as [[metamorphic zone]]s, as these are defined as a region on a geological map where the pressure-temperature conditions for an [[index mineral]] (a mineral that indicates the approximate metamorphic grade of a rock), were appropriate for these minerals to form.<ref>Philpotts,A. and Klein,C.

[[File:Al2SiO5_phase_diagram.svg|thumb|The Buchan and Barrovian facies series relate to this diagram of Al<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>5</sub> polymorphs (also called a petrogenetic grid), with increasing temperature along the x-axis and increasing pressure along the y-axis. See [[Metamorphism#Regional]]]]
[[File:Metamorphic Facies Series-Barrowian Buchan.png|alt=|thumb|The figure above shows different metamorphic series for different rocks. The names Buchan and Barrovian facies series are often used in another context, i.e. for the kyanite-andalusite-sillimanite polymorphs. However, Buchan facies series plot along line 3 and Barrovian at somewhat higher pressure and with the appearance of kyanite. The facies series have connections to [[plate tectonics]]. Facies series 1 is typical of contact metamorphism, but also found in regional metamorphosed rocks. Facies series 2 correlates with [[volcanic arc]] environments, and so on: 3. Collisional mountain belts, regional metamorphism 4. Stable continents and 5. Accretionary prisms. Original image: Woudloper.]]

* Buchan metamorphism has the facies series [[greenschist]]-[[amphibolite]]-[[granulite]]
* Barrovian metamorphism has the same facies series but has approximately 1&nbsp;kbar more pressure so these rocks form [[kyanite]]<ref>Tulane University</ref>
