{{Discrimination sidebar|state=collapsed}}
In 2005 the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) distributed a "self evaluation" to its member institutions for teams to examine the use of potentially offensive imagery with their mascot choice.

==Waivers granted==
The NCAA has granted waivers from their mascot policy to five university teams originally on the "hostile and abusive" list that obtained official support from individual tribes for the use of their names and images, based upon the principle of [[Tribal sovereignty in the United States|Tribal Sovereignty]]. As stated by the NCAI: "In general, NCAI strongly opposes the use of derogatory Native sports mascots. However, in the case where mascots refer to a particular Native nation or nations, NCAI respects the right of individual tribal nations to work with universities and athletic programs to decide how to protect and celebrate their respective tribal heritage."<ref name="NCAI">{{cite web|url=http://www.ncai.org/policy-issues/community-and-culture/anti-defamation-mascots|title=Anti-Defamation and Mascots|publisher=National Congress of American Indians|accessdate=12 January 2013}}</ref>

*[[Florida State University]] ([[Florida State Seminoles|Seminoles]]): The name [[Seminoles]] was selected by student vote in the 1940s, and for the first two decades the athletic teams mostly used images based on stereotypes such as in [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] [[Western (genre)|Westerns]]. Leaders of the [[Seminole Tribe of Florida]] who attended a basketball game on the campus in 1972 expressed their concerns to university officials regarding the antics of such mascots as ''[[Sammy Seminole]]'' and ''[[Osceola and Renegade#Previous mascots|Chief Fullabull]]'' which were retired that year.<ref>{{cite news|last=DeSlatte |first=Aaron |url=https://groups.yahoo.com/group/NatNews/message/39441 |title=FSU worked to cultivate better image of Seminole |newspaper=Florida Today |date=August 17, 2005 |accessdate=June 13, 2012}}</ref> 1978 marked the first appearance of [[Osceola and Renegade]], in which a student portrays the 19th-century Seminole leader [[Osceola]], riding Renegade, an [[Appaloosa]] horse. The student, chosen for his horsemanship, wears clothing provided by the Seminole tribe but is not necessarily of Native American descent himself. The Seminole Tribe of Florida officially sanctions the use of the Seminole as Florida State University's nickname and of Osceola as FSU's symbol. Max Osceola, the chief and general council president of the Seminole Tribe of Florida, has stated that he regards it as an "honor" to be associated with the university. However, the Seminole Tribe of Florida is only one of the tribal authorities representing Seminoles. Some members of the much larger [[Seminole Nation of Oklahoma]] objected to the use of the name and imagery, leading to the NCAA originally placed FSU on the list of colleges using imagery "hostile or abusive" towards Native Americans.<ref name="mess">{{cite news|url=http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2005/08/08/mascot|title=The Mascot Mess|date=August 8, 2005|first=Doug|last=Lederman|newspaper=Inside Higher Ed|accessdate=February 8, 2013}}</ref> However, in July 2005, the Seminole Nation General Council, the legislative body for the Seminole Nation of Oklahoma, voted 18–2 not to oppose the use of Native American names and mascots by college sports teams.<ref name="McBee">{{cite web|url=http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/8940521/|title=Seminole Nation OK with use of mascot|publisher=NBC Sports|accessdate=February 6, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207222547/http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/8940521/|archive-date=February 7, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> One opponent is [[David Narcomey]] who has referred to Osceola as a "minstrel show."<ref>{{Cite news|title=Florida State's Chief Osceola disgusts member of Seminole tribe of Oklahoma |publisher=News OK|accessdate=2015-01-02|url=http://newsok.com/florida-states-chief-osceola-disgusts-member-of-seminole-tribe-of-oklahoma/article/3604488}}</ref> The relationship between the Florida tribe and the university has been maintained to the present, with few voices in opposition.<ref>{{cite news|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/29/sports/ncaafootball/29seminoles.html?pagewanted=all|title=Bonding Over a Mascot|first=JOE|last=LAPOINTE|date=December 29, 2006|accessdate=February 2, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/24/sports/ncaafootball/amid-rising-discord-over-indian-images-florida-state-has-harmony.html?_r=0|title=Amid Rising Discord Over Indian Images, F.S.U.
