{{short description|Vaccination against the rabies virus}}
'''Purified duck embryo vaccine (PDEV)''' was the first [[vaccine]] developed for human use in treating pre- and postexposure to the [[rabies virus]]. It was developed in 1957 and was made of dried, killed rabies virus. Vaccination with PDEV involved a series of intradermal injections over several days. The [[World Health Organization]] still includes PDEV in its list of recommended vaccines for treatment of rabies virus exposure. However, newer vaccines are more commonly used. These include the [[human diploid cell vaccine]] (HDCV) first introduced in 1978; purified chicken embryo cell vaccine (PCECV), developed in 1984; and a purified Vero cell rabies vaccine (PVCRV) developed in 1986.<ref>Keller H, Glueck R, Wegmann A et al.
