[[File:Janet Jackson & Justin Timberlake's wardrobe malfunction.jpg|thumb|right|Janet Jackson and Justin Timberlake immediately after Timberlake tore off part of Jackson's clothes at the end of the [[Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show]].]]

The [[Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show]], which was broadcast [[Live television|live]] on February 1, 2004, from [[Houston]], [[Texas]], on the [[CBS]] television network, is notable for a moment in which [[Janet Jackson]]'s right breast—adorned with a [[Nipple shield (jewelry)|nipple shield]]—was exposed by [[Justin Timberlake]] to the viewing public. The incident, sometimes referred to as '''Nipplegate''' or '''Janetgate''', led to an immediate crackdown and widespread discourse on perceived [[Inappropriateness|indecency]] in broadcasting.

The halftime show was produced by [[MTV]] and was focused on the network's [[MTV#Choose or Lose|''Choose or Lose'']] campaign (the year 2004 was a presidential election year in the United States). The exposure was broadcast to a total audience of 150&nbsp;million viewers. Following the incident, the [[National Football League]] (NFL) excluded MTV, which had also produced the halftime show for [[Super Bowl XXXV]], from future halftime shows. In addition, CBS parent company [[Viacom (original)|Viacom]] and its co-owned subsidiaries, MTV and [[Infinity Broadcasting]], enforced a [[blacklisting|blacklist]] of Jackson's [[single (music)|singles]] and [[music video]]s on many radio formats and music channels worldwide. The [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) fined CBS for an indecency violation of $27,500 and increased it to $325,000. They eventually fined CBS a record $550,000 for the incident, but that fine was ultimately voided by the [[Third Circuit Court of Appeals]] in 2011, and a case to reinstate the fine was refused in 2012.

The incident was ridiculed both within the United States and abroad, with a number of commentators opining that it was a planned [[publicity stunt]]. Some American commentators, including Jackson herself, argued it was being used as a means to distract the public from the ongoing [[Iraq War]]. The increased regulation of broadcasting raised concerns regarding [[Censorship in the United States|censorship]] and [[Freedom of speech in the United States|free speech in the United States]]. [[YouTube]] co-founder [[Jawed Karim]] credits the incident with leading to the creation of the video sharing website. The incident also made Janet Jackson the most-searched person and term of 2004 and 2005, and it broke the record for "most-searched event over one day". It also became the most-watched, recorded, and replayed television moment in [[TiVo]] history and "enticed an estimated 35,000 new [TiVo] subscribers to sign up". The term "[[wardrobe malfunction]]" was coined as a result of the incident, and eventually added to the ''[[Webster's Dictionary|Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary]]''.

In April 2021, celebrity stylist [[Wayne Scot Lukas]] claimed that it was planned by Timberlake, who sought to upstage his ex-girlfriend [[Britney Spears]]' MTV Video Music Awards appearance at which she kissed [[Madonna]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://uk.news.yahoo.com/justin-timberlake-insisted-janet-jackson-140234724.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAALDfbJh8up0QEuLR-FF0WUbrMtLO_cH6dn4SD5spIuBBK-kMTrZjcyhHw8l7yk5ZeOXB43XnmT38QMQrpea_CAUjuJPJYwM_PgzBSuQOIOC0qj_VZQ6SSYxo3CKKO_gyrBVIjwY9IwbJcOTTuTSf6H0sv47BubZ8MTuM2GwDapDa |title=Justin Timberlake 'insisted' on Janet Jackson's wardrobe malfunction to upstage Britney Spears

==Background and development==
Janet Jackson was the original choice to perform at the [[Super Bowl XXXVI halftime show|halftime show for Super Bowl XXXVI]], but the NFL ultimately selected [[U2]] after a group of NFL owners and officials attended the band's concert in [[New York City]] shortly after the [[September 11 attacks]].<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Pro Bono Work: Carey, McCartney and U2|url=https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,252449,00.html|last=Young|first=Josh|magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=February 15, 2002|access-date=January 30, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202095753/https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,252449,00.html|archive-date=February 2, 2014}}</ref> In September 2003, the NFL chose Jackson as the headline performer of the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show.<ref>{{cite news|title=The NFL and CBS Look to MTV to Produce the AOL Super Bowl XXXVIII Halftime Show|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-nfl-and-cbs-look-to-mtv-to-produce-the-aol-super-bowl-xxxviii-halftime-show-73262057.html|agency=[[PR Newswire]]|date=September 12, 2003|access-date=April 1, 2014}}</ref> Because the event was occurring during [[2004 United States presidential election|an election year]], MTV decided that the show's theme would heavily focus on the network's "[[MTV#Choose or Lose|Choose or Lose]]" campaign, which encouraged younger viewers to be politically active and register to vote.<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Lane|2006|pp=25}}</ref>

===Powell's response===
A decade after the incident, former FCC chairman Michael Powell gave his first interview regarding Jackson's performance, saying Jackson was treated unfairly and the controversy, including his own reaction, was completely overblown. Powell stated, "I think we've been removed from this long enough for me to tell you that I had to put my best version of outrage on that I could put on. Part of it was surreal, right? Look, I think it was dumb to happen, and they knew the rules and were flirting with them, and my job is to enforce the rules, but, you know, 'Really? This is what we're gonna do?' ⁠" Powell also said the treatment of Jackson, who was lambasted for causing "an outrageous stunt", was unfair, and commented on Timberlake not receiving the same backlash. "I personally thought that was really unfair", he said. "It all turned into being about her. In reality, if you slow the thing down, it's Justin ripping off her breastplate."<ref name=powell>{{cite web|title=In the Beginning, There Was a Nipple | url= http://espn.go.com/espn/feature/story/_/id/10333439/wardrobe-malfunction-beginning-there-was-nipple|work=[[ESPN The Magazine]] | first=Marin|last= Cogan|date=January 28, 2014|access-date=June 27, 2016| archive-date=January 28, 2014 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140128191518/http://espn.go.com/espn/feature/story/_/id/10333439/wardrobe-malfunction-beginning-there-was-nipple | url-status=live}}</ref>

The Super Bowl controversy was also a subject of humor on [[late-night talk show]]s. For example, CBS's own ''Late Show with David Letterman'' mocked the incident all week following the Super Bowl. The day after the Super Bowl, host [[David Letterman]] joked that he "was happy to see this thing happen&nbsp;... because that meant for one night I wasn't the biggest [[Idiot (usage)|boob]] on CBS".<ref>{{cite episode|title=Show #2114|url=http://www.cbs.com/latenight/lateshow/video_player/index/php/891894.phtml|series=[[Late Show with David Letterman]]|network=[[CBS]]|airdate=February 2, 2004 |transcript=Transcript|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070515053217/http://www.cbs.com/latenight/lateshow/video_player/index/php/891894.phtml|archive-date=May 15, 2007|transcript-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930235809/http://www.cbs.com/latenight/lateshow/wahoo/index/php/20040202.phtml}}</ref> The next day, he also joked that President [[George W.

The halftime show continued to be a subject of discussion in 2005. The parody newspaper ''[[The Onion]]'' ran a lead article on January 26, 2005 entitled "U.S. Children Still Traumatized One Year After Seeing Partially Exposed Breast On TV". The article's satirical target was the nation's reaction to the incident rather than the incident itself.<ref>{{cite web|title=U.S. Children Still Traumatized One Year After Seeing Partially Exposed Breast On TV|url=http://www.theonion.com/content/node/30883|work=[[The Onion]]|date=January 26, 2005|access-date=November 29, 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100223085304/http://www.theonion.com/content/node/30883|archive-date=February 23, 2010}}</ref> On February 1, 2005, exactly one year after the halftime show, the PTC released a report titled ''MTV Smut Peddlers: Targeting Kids with Sex, Drugs, and Alcohol'', covering MTV programming during the network's "Spring Break" week from March 20 to 27, 2004, accusing MTV of irresponsibly promoting sex, drugs and alcohol to impressionable youth.

===New Zealand===
New Zealand news outlets re-broadcast the "nipplegate" moment (some in slow motion) with commentary alleging that US ultra-conservatives had made the incident into a major controversy. The nation's largest newspaper, the ''New Zealand Herald'', ran an op-ed from a New Zealander living in America detailing his bafflement at his American friends, who had expressed outrage at the glimpse of a nipple while supporting their country's invasion of Iraq and being fans of the premium cable and adult-rated [[HBO]] series ''[[Sex and the City]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/iroger-franklini-double-standards-rife-in-americas-fickle-society/5EVEOCSL367Y3LSO227SXSHMEA/ |title=Roger Franklin: Double standards rife in America's fickle society |date=7 February 2004 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |access-date=30 March 2022}}</ref>

===Legal action===

On February 4, Terri Carlin, a banker residing in [[Knoxville, Tennessee]], filed a [[class action]] lawsuit against Jackson and Timberlake on behalf of "all American citizens who watched the outrageous conduct". The lawsuit alleged that the halftime show contained "sexually explicit acts solely designed to garner publicity and, ultimately, to increase profits for themselves". The lawsuit sought maximum [[punitive damages|punitive]] and compensatory damages from the performers.

==Other controversies==

===Commercials===
Prior to the broadcast, CBS rejected the MoveOn.org [[Super Bowl advertising|Super Bowl ad]] ''[[Bush in 30 Seconds]]'' because it was deemed too controversial. CBS stated that it had a "decades-old" policy of rejecting advertisements regarding "controversial issues of public importance", although MoveOn charged that the networks had previously accepted similar advertisements from other groups.<ref>{{cite news|title=Censored at the Super Bowl|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2004/01/29/censored-at-the-super-bowl.html|author=Jonathan Darman|work=[[Newsweek]]|via=[[The Daily Beast]]|date=January 30, 2004|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040309180112/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/4114703|archive-date=March 9, 2004}}</ref> The Super Bowl broadcast contained numerous commercials for [[erectile dysfunction]] medicines and advertisements for [[Anheuser-Busch]]'s [[Bud Light]] brand featuring a [[flatulence|flatulating]] horse and a dog attacking male [[genitalia]]; however, no politically charged advertisements appeared during the telecast.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Monkey business|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2004/football/nfl/specials/playoffs/2003/02/02/commercials/index.html|author=Dan George|magazine=[[Sports Illustrated]]|date=February 2, 2004|access-date=July 25, 2008}}</ref> CBS, which also held the rights to [[Super Bowl XLIV]], later aired a commercial during that game featuring then-[[Florida Gators football|Florida Gators]] quarterback [[Tim Tebow]] and his mother that discreetly refer to their [[anti-abortion]] viewpoints.

==Aftermath and effects==

===Censorship and regulation of broadcasting===
Website Soap Opera Central speculated that the fallout from this incident may have had a subtle effect on [[daytime television]]. These television shows are known for "[[Love in the Afternoon (advertising campaign)|love in the afternoon]]" and regularly depict romantic couplings; shortly before the Super Bowl, the [[Procter & Gamble]] [[soap opera]]s ''[[As the World Turns]]'' and ''[[Guiding Light]]'' had gone as far as featuring rear male nudity during sexual scenes. After the Super Bowl controversy, FCC commissioner [[Michael J. Copps]] stated that it was time for a crackdown on inappropriate sexual content in daytime television, and indicated that he was reviewing whether soap operas were violating the agency's indecency prohibitions.<ref name="cleanupsoaps">{{cite news|title=FCC says soaps may need to be cleaned up|url=http://www.soapcentral.com/soapcentral/news/2004/0412-fcc.php|author=Dan J.

Two other major sporting events that followed the Super Bowl that year also changed their respective halftime shows following the incident. At the [[Pro Bowl]], which would be played on February 8 at [[Aloha Stadium]] in Hawaii, singer [[JC Chasez]], a member of boy band 'N Sync as was Timberlake, was to sing the [[Star-Spangled Banner|National Anthem]] before the game and perform his hit song "[[Blowin' Me Up (with Her Love)]]" at [[halftime]]. However, the NFL did not allow Chasez to perform during halftime due to the sexually suggestive content of his chosen song (even though the game was carried by ESPN, which is not under the content purview of the FCC as it is a cable network, and therefore only self-regulates content as an advertiser-supported service), replacing it with traditional Hawaiian hula dancers.<ref>{{cite web|title=Justin 'Appalled' By Super Bowl Incident; NFL Nixes JC Appearance|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1484824/justin-appalled-by-super-bowl-incident.jhtml|author=Corey Moss|publisher=MTV News|access-date=August 24, 2013|date=February 4, 2004}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=JC Chasez Slams NFL After Being Cut From Pro Bowl Halftime|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1484842/jc-slams-nfl-after-being-cut-from-pro-bowl.jhtml|author=Corey Moss|publisher=MTV News|access-date=August 24, 2013|date=February 5, 2004}}</ref> The [[2004 NBA All-Star Game]] also changed its act, despite being broadcast on [[TNT (U.S. TV network)|TNT]] (which is not bound by FCC content regulations as a cable network), having halftime performer [[Beyoncé]] perform "[[Crazy in Love]]" instead of "[[Naughty Girl (Beyoncé song)|Naughty Girl]]", which they feared would incite controversy given its sexual content.

''Guiding Light''{{clarify|date=July 2021}} edited out nudity from an episode that had already been taped. A week later, the show's [[executive producer]] [[John Conboy]] was fired and replaced by [[Ellen Wheeler]]. All nine American network soaps began to impose an unwritten rule of avoiding any sort of risqué adult scenes, and in the months following, editors of soap opera periodical ''[[Soap Opera Digest]]'' wrote about how daytime television was losing its steam.<ref name="cleanupsoaps"/> [[NBC]] also re-edited a scene from an episode of its medical drama ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]'' where paramedics were wheeling an elderly woman into the hospital, and her breast could be seen in the context of her injury and treatment.<ref>{{cite news|title=NBC's 'ER' Cuts Shot of Patient's Breast|url=http://customwire.ap.org/dynamic/stories/T/TV_ER_BREAST?SITE=FLTAM&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT|author=Lynn Elber|agency=Associated Press|date=February 4, 2004|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040223195103/http://customwire.ap.org/dynamic/stories/T/TV_ER_BREAST?SITE=FLTAM&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT|archive-date=February 23, 2004}}</ref> Even as late as [[Veterans Day (United States)|Veterans Day]] (November 11) of 2004, 65 ABC-affiliated stations pre-empted the uncut network presentation of the film ''Saving Private Ryan'' over concerns about the film's violent content and FCC regulations.

A petition was filed by a consortium of broadcasters (which included Viacom) and the RIAA over an FCC indecency ruling, regarding [[fleeting expletives]] uttered by [[Bono]] of [[U2]] when accepting an award at the [[60th Golden Globe Awards]] in 2003. It argued that the FCC had implemented a standard "that would allow it to censor all kinds of things—anything considered blasphemous, coarse or vulgar", and observed that many radio stations, especially [[rock music|rock]]-formatted stations, had been engaging in self-censorship by censoring or removing songs from their libraries, so that they would not run afoul of the stricter regulation.<ref name=rock>{{cite magazine|title=Media Fights for Free Speech|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/media-fights-for-free-speech-20040511|author=Damien Cave|magazine=Rolling Stone|date=November 5, 2004|access-date=April 1, 2014}}</ref> [[Clear Channel Communications]] removed talk-radio host [[Howard Stern]] from several of its large-market radio stations within a month of the incident, citing the raunchy content of Stern's show.

The incident also prompted tighter control over content by station owners and managers. Viacom, at the center of the controversy, also employed the controversial Howard Stern in its radio division (at the time called [[Infinity Broadcasting]]). The expanding control on content is said to be a contributing factor that drove Stern away from [[terrestrial radio]] and onto [[Sirius Satellite Radio]], and is sometimes credited as the media figure most responsible for introducing a new era in radio.<ref name=cogin/> It has also been reported that some teen-oriented awards shows in the summer of 2004 had also been purged of most sexual and profane content that had been perceived as staples in such awards telecasts in the past, including Fox's [[Teen Choice Awards]] and MTV's self-created Video Music Awards.<ref name="toned down">{{cite web|title=Toned Down Awards Shows|url=http://archive.mr.org/BozellColumns/entertainmentcolumn/2004/col20040902.asp|author=L.

Beginning with [[Super Bowl XXXIX]] in 2005, the halftime show began to be produced by [[Don Mischer|Don Mischer Productions]] and White Cherry Entertainment; those shows contained classic rock artists who mainly performed songs from the 1970s and 1980s (with a notable exception being [[Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band]] performing their 2008 single "[[Working on a Dream]]" during the [[Super Bowl XLIII]] halftime show in 2009). This practice ended after [[Super Bowl XLIV]] in 2010; beginning with [[Super Bowl XLV]] in 2011, the halftime performance returned to having pop artists.

In 2012, during the halftime show for [[Super Bowl XLVI]], rapper [[M.I.A. (artist)|M.I.A.]] [[Finger (gesture)|pointed up her middle finger]] during her performance. That incident drew comparisons with the exposure of Janet Jackson's breast in the Super Bowl halftime show eight years prior.

The NFL also came under some smaller controversies over its telecasts. The FCC received a complaint about Fox's telecast of a January 2005 playoff game between the [[Green Bay Packers]] and [[Minnesota Vikings]]; the complainant alleged that Minnesota player [[Randy Moss]], who scored a touchdown, apparently made movements appearing to [[mooning|moon]] the spectators. However, the FCC denied the complaint because Moss was fully clothed at all times, and his gestures were shown for only a few seconds, thus warranting that the display was not indecent; game commentator [[Joe Buck]] also immediately condemned the act (and additionally, Moss was fined by the NFL).<ref>{{cite news|title=FCC sheds moonlight|url=http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=408451|author=Bob Wolfley|newspaper=[[Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel]]|date=March 15, 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060527001423/http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=408451|archive-date=May 27, 2006}}</ref> On January 13, 2007, during Fox's coverage of an NFL playoff game between the [[New Orleans Saints]] and [[Philadelphia Eagles]], the camera cut to the stands, showing for four seconds a shirt with the words "[[Fuck]] DA EAGLES" that was worn by a female spectator.

Media commentators stated Jackson was treated too harshly by the media and public, while Timberlake's career was not affected much by the incident. Shannon L.

The term "wardrobe malfunction" began to be used by various entertainers when describing accidental public exposures or nudity, or revealing outfits.

In the episode, [[Trey Parker|the show's]] [[Matt Stone|creators]] draw attention to the media and public's unnecessary reaction to Jackson's brief exposure while disregarding or accepting extreme acts of violence during a scene where the public is outraged when Eric Cartman is seen naked and having a "wardrobe malfunction" on stage, while character Butters Stotch is ignored although he is bleeding and severely injured.

Several presenters at award shows have referenced the incident, including [[Anna Nicole Smith]] at the first annual [[MTV Australia Video Music Awards 2005|MTV Australia Video Music Awards]], Dave Chappelle at the MTV Video Music Awards, and singer [[Alanis Morissette]] at the [[Juno Awards]]. Morissette also commented: "It's disturbing and curious to me to see what came of that. We're all sexual beings, and if we don't let it out organically, we repress ourselves.
