{{short description|Cheating at a marathon race}}
'''Marathon course-cutting''' occurs when runners complete less than an entire course of a [[marathon]] before going over the finish line. The standard length of a marathon course is 42.195 kilometers, about 26.2 miles. Course-cutting may be intentional or unintentional and can be achieved by various means: when done intentionally, course-cutting constitutes cheating.

Many marathon runners consider intentional course-cutting to be worse than [[Doping in sport|doping]], believing that those who are doping are at least trying to run the entire race.<ref name="IronmanCanada">{{cite news|author1=Sarah Lyall|date=April 10, 2018|title=Swim.

==Notable incidents==

In 1896, [[Spyridon Belokas]] rode in a carriage for part of the [[athletics at the 1896 Summer Olympics – Men's marathon|Olympic marathon]] in [[Athens, Greece|Athens]] after having supposedly dropped out of the race, and appeared to have finished third to seemingly complete a Greek top-three sweep. After a protest by fourth-place finisher [[Gyula Kellner]] was upheld, Belokas was disqualified.

In 1904, [[Frederick Lorz]] dropped out of [[athletics at the 1904 Summer Olympics – Men's marathon|Olympic marathon]] in [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] after nine  miles (14.48km); he then rode in a car for the next 11 miles (17.7km) before jogging to the finish line, where he was greeted as the winner of the event before his deception was uncovered.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://youngjournalistacademy.com/2015/01/16/1904-olympics-us-dominance/|title=1904 Olympics: US Dominance|publisher=Young Journalist Academy|language=English|date=16 January 2015|accessdate=29 April 2016}}</ref>

In October 1979, [[Rosie Ruiz]] rode the [[New York City Subway]] during the [[New York City Marathon]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/unknown-runner-rosie-ruiz-1980-chapter-169-article-1.514325|title=Every Unknown Runner Rosie Ruiz, 1980 Chapter 169|publisher=New York Daily News|language=English|author=Jay Maeder|date=28 October 2003|accessdate=29 April 2016}}</ref> In doing so, she qualified for the April 1980 [[Boston Marathon]], where she appeared to have won the women's race in a course record time: after it was discovered she had only run the last half-mile (800m) of the race, her medal was revoked and her result deleted from the records;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://time.com/3822577/rosie-ruiz-history/|title=How One Woman Won a Marathon and Barely Broke a Sweat|publisher=Time|language=English|author=Jennifer Latson|date=21 April 2015|accessdate=29 April 2016}}</ref> in any case, the discovery that Ruiz had cut the course in New York would have been enough to automatically disqualify her from Boston.<ref name=EagleTribune>Burt, Bill.

In 2007, [[Roberto Madrazo]], a Mexican presidential candidate in 2006, had his results in the [[Berlin Marathon]] deleted after his timing chip revealed Madrazo had skipped two checkpoints on the course, and had covered one nine-mile segment in 21 minutes (far faster than world record speed for such a distance).<ref>

==News coverage==

In 2006, the ''[[Washington Post]]'' reported that the seventh- and eighth-place women’s finishers of the 2006 [[Marine Corps Marathon]] were disqualified. Rick Nealis, the race director, had also disqualified 350 runners in the 2005 race.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/11/01/AR2006110102959.html | title= Two Runners Caught Cheating At Marine Corps Marathon |work=[[Washington Post]] |date= November 2, 2006 |accessdate=June 3, 2015}}</ref>

In 2009, the ''[[New York Times]]'' ran an article on course-cutting, including a map of where approximately 46 runners in the 2008 New York City Marathon had left and reentered the course. “An untold number of [course-cutting] runners escape detection, marathon officials said.” <ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/01/sports/01runners.html | title=In a 26-Mile Slog, a Shortcut Can Be Tempting |work=[[The New York Times]] |date= October 31, 2009 |accessdate=June 3, 2015}}</ref> 

In 2010, the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' reported that in “the 2009 [[Chicago Marathon]], 252 runners' times were deleted from the records, most for missing two or more timing mats in a row.”<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2010-10-08/sports/ct-spt-1008-marathon-cheaters--20101007_1_chicago-marathon-previous-marathons-carey-pinkowski | title=Chicago Marathon cheaters: why do they do it? |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |date= October 8, 2010 |accessdate=June 3, 2015}}</ref>

In a 2012 ''[[New York Post]]'' article, a New York City Marathon official calculated that "each year an average of 30 to 40 are disqualified" from the marathon.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://nypost.com/2012/10/31/running-a-scam/ | title=Running a scam |work=[[New York Post]] |date= October 31, 2012 |accessdate=June 3, 2015}}</ref>

In 2014, ''[[Runner's World]]'' reported that the apparent women's winner of the Chickamauga Battlefield Marathon was disqualified after her splits indicated she had not run the entire race. She had appeared to win in 2:54:21 (2:55:39 gun time), but she appeared to have run the second half of the race in 47:30, which would have far exceeded the then-world record for the men's half-marathon, while her past race times were inconsistent with her supposed performance in Chickamauga.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.runnersworld.com/races-places/a20834541/chickamauga-marathon-winner-disqualified-for-impossible-splits/|title=Chickamauga Marathon Winner Disqualified for Impossible Splits|author1=Alison Wade|publisher=[[Runner's World]]|date=November 11, 2014}}</ref>

In 2015, the ''New York Times'' reported that the original winner of the women's 40-44 category at [[Ironman Triathlon|Ironman]] Canada 2015 had been disqualified after evidence came to light that showed she had not run the entire race. The second-, third- and fourth-place finishers could not recall seeing her, and the runner-up went as far as to publicly confront the winner and ask when she passed her, an unusual occurrence according to Ironman Canada's regional director. The other three athletes conducted their own investigation after race officials rebuffed them, and compiled evidence that indicated that the apparent winner could not possibly have reached specific points at the times she claimed during the marathon segment of the competition. Confronted with this evidence, [[World Triathlon Corporation]] disqualified her from Ironman Canada 2015 and retroactively disqualified her from Ironman Canada 2013 and the 2014 Vancouver Triathlon, also taking the unprecedented step of banning her from all Ironman events indefinitely.<ref name=IronmanCanada/>
