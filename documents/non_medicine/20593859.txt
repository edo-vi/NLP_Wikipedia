"'''Jizz in My Pants'''" is a [[SNL Digital Short]] which aired on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' on December 6, 2008, and [[YouTube]] on the same day. It serves as the music video for the first single from [[the Lonely Island]]'s debut album, ''[[Incredibad]]''.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://popwatch.ew.com/popwatch/2008/12/j-in-my-pants-t.html |title='J In My Pants': The resurgence of Jamie-Lynn Sigler |access-date=December 15, 2008 |last=Pastorek |first=Whitney |date=December 8, 2008 |magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |archive-date=December 17, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217011212/http://popwatch.ew.com/popwatch/2008/12/j-in-my-pants-t.html |url-status=dead }}</ref> The video stars the Lonely Island members [[Andy Samberg]], [[Jorma Taccone]] and, briefly, [[Akiva Schaffer]], and also features guest appearances by [[Justin Timberlake]] (who had also appeared in "[[Dick in a Box]]"), [[Molly Sims]] and [[Jamie-Lynn Sigler]].

== Music video ==

The singing is done in soft British [[Received Pronunciation]]-style accents in the style of the [[Pet Shop Boys]] and their song "[[West End Girls]]", with Samberg additionally comparing the beat to the works of producer [[Timbaland]]. The video opens with Samberg in a night club singing as he is about to hit on a woman ([[Molly Sims]]). They head to her apartment, share a kiss in the hallway outside her door, but once she says that "she wants some more" (i.e. sex),  he "[[Ejaculation|jizzes]]" [[premature ejaculation|prematurely]]. He refuses to apologize, saying it would be "absurd" and blames the woman for overstimulating him by rubbing his "[[buttocks|butt]]", before he goes home "and change[s]". Taccone is then shown in a grocery store (where [[Justin Timberlake]] makes a [[cameo appearance]] as a janitor) conversing with a check-out lady ([[Jamie-Lynn Sigler]]), but ejaculates in his pants as well when she asks, "cash or [[Credit card|credit]]?" After explaining that the way she bags cans got him "bothered and hot", he tells her that he will pay by [[cheque|check]].

Samberg then exits a [[movie theater]] when the discovery of a missed cellphone call from the woman he met at the club causes him to prematurely ejaculate again. In another scene, Taccone is seen driving a [[Mercedes-Benz]] while listening to the radio, when a song begins to play that reminds him of the check-out lady, causing him to "jizz" in his pants yet again. Samberg and Taccone then sing about how easily they "jizz in [their] pants" from stimuli such as an alarm clock, opening a window, the twist ending of ''[[The Sixth Sense]]'', and simply eating a grape. They explain that merely being adjacent to women causes them to ejaculate, which, they lament, necessitates the constant wearing of [[condom]]s under their underpants. Akiva Schaffer can be seen in the background at various times as the disc jockey.<ref name="youtube">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pXfHLUlZf4&feature=hd |title=Jizz In My Pants |access-date=December 30, 2008 |work=[[The Lonely Island]] |publisher=[[YouTube]] }}</ref>

== Background ==

"Jizz in My Pants" was written by the Lonely Island during the summer of 2008. The comedy troupe rented a house in [[Los Angeles]] and created a makeshift studio where they would record songs.<ref name="Interview">{{cite news|last=Heisler |first=Steve |url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/the-lonely-island,56484/ |title=The Lonely Island &#124; Music &#124; Interview |newspaper=[[The A.V. Club]] |access-date=May 24, 2011}}</ref> The music video was filmed in early September 2008, the week before the 34th season of ''Saturday Night Live'' premiered. The Lonely Island did not originally intend for it to actually be aired on the show, but the positive reactions by fellow cast and crew members persuaded them to change their minds.<ref name="VH1">{{cite web|last=Kaufman|first=Gil|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1601144/andy-samberg-recruits-t-pain-justin-timberlake-new-album.jhtml|title ='SNL' Star Andy Samberg Recruits T-Pain, Justin Timberlake, Norah Jones For New Album|publisher=[[MTV]]|date= December 11, 2008|access-date=February 28, 2014}}</ref>

== Reception ==

=== Critical ===

A number of commentators enjoyed "Jizz in My Pants". Jennifer Maerz of ''[[SF Weekly]]'' felt the video was "funny in a totally moronic way", describing it as "pure electro-trash" with "[[Douche#Slang uses|douchebag]] clothes, attitudes, and beats".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.sfweekly.com/shookdown/2008/12/electro-stupidity_jizzing_with.php |title=Electro-Stupidity: Jizzing with SNL |access-date=December 15, 2008 |last=Maerz |first=Jennifer |date=December 12, 2008 |work=[[SF Weekly]] }}</ref>  Mickey O'Connor of [[TV Guide]] liked the song's "clever lyrics" which "brilliantly satirize the pompous chill of '90s synth rock.'"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/Mega-CSI-Lost-1000705.aspx |title=Mega Buzz on CSI, Lost, Big Bang, CSI: NY, Gossip & More! |access-date=December 15, 2008 |last=O'Connor |first=Mickey |date=December 9, 2008 |work=[[TV Guide]] }}</ref> ''[[The New York Observer]]'' writer Christopher Rosen described the video as "awesomely catchy", in contrast to the rest of the ''SNL'' episode, which he felt was not very good.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.observer.com/2008/o2/i-late-night-jimmy-fallon-i-goes-online |title=Late Night with Jimmy Fallon Goes Online; Will It Get Viral? |access-date=December 15, 2008 |last=Rosen |first=Christopher |date=December 8, 2008 |work=[[The New York Observer]] |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211004159/http://www.observer.com/2008/o2/i-late-night-jimmy-fallon-i-goes-online |archive-date=December 11, 2008 }}</ref>

"Jizz in My Pants" reception was not all positive, however. Jerry Portwood of ''[[New York Press]]'' compared the video unfavorably to the work of [["Weird Al" Yankovic]]. The video did not satisfy him "beyond a few chuckles." Portwood preferred Yankovic's ability to parody current events and pop culture, dissecting "what was actually manipulative and mind-numbing about popular music and the market as a whole". He wrote that Samberg, in contrast, sticks to "safe and, ultimately, ineffective parody."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nypress.com/blog-3025-samberg-co-dont-compare-to-weird-al-as-song-satirists.html |title=Samberg & Co.
