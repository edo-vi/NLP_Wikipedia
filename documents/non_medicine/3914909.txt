'''White dog shaker syndrome''' (also known as '''idiopathic steroid responsive shaker syndrome''', '''shaker dog syndrome''' and '''"little white  shakers" syndrome'''; Latin name Idiopathic Cerebellitis) causes full body tremors in small dog breeds. It is most common in [[West Highland White Terrier]]s, [[Maltese dog|Maltese]], [[Bichon]]s, [[Poodle]]s,<ref name=Etiinger_1995>{{cite book|author=Ettinger, Stephen J.|author2=Feldman, Edward C.|title=Textbook of Veterinary Internal Medicine|edition=4th|publisher=W.B. Saunders Company|year=1995|isbn=0-7216-6795-3}}</ref> and other small dogs.  There is a sudden onset of the disease at one to two years of age.  It is more likely to occur, and the symptom is worse during times of [[Stress (physiology)|stress]].  [[pathologic nystagmus|Nystagmus]], difficulty walking, and [[seizure]]s may occur in some dogs.
