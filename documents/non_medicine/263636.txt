[[File:Artificial_neural_network.svg|thumb|A 'second wave' connectionist (ANN) model with a hidden layer]]
'''Connectionism''' (coined by [[Edward Thorndike]] in the 1930s) is the name of an approach to the study of human mental processes and cognition that utilizes mathematical models known as connectionist networks or artificial neural networks.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://iep.utm.edu/connectionism-cognition/#:~:text=Connectionism%20is%20an%20approach%20to,%2C%20neuron%2Dlike%20processing%20units.|title=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|website=iep.utm.edu|access-date=2023-08-19}}</ref> Connectionism has had many 'waves' since its beginnings.

The first wave appeared in the 1950s with [[Warren Sturgis McCulloch]] and [[Walter Pitts]] both focusing on comprehending neural circuitry through a formal and mathematical approach, and [[Frank Rosenblatt]] who published the 1958 book “The Perceptron: A Probabilistic Model For Information Storage and Organization in the Brain” in ''Psychological Review'', while working at the Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory.<ref name="2019TheCuriousCaseOfConnectionism">{{Cite journal|last=Berkeley |first= Istvan S.

The first wave ended with the 1969 book about the limitations of the original perceptron idea, written by [[Marvin Minsky]] and [[Papert]], which contributed to discouraging major funding agencies in the US from investing in connectionist research.<ref name="2006_Margaret_Boden_book">{{Cite book|title=Mind as Machine: A History of Cognitive Science | url=https://archive.org/details/mindasmachinehis0002bode/page/n5/mode/thumb |url-access=limited|last=Boden |first=Margaret |publisher=Oxford U.P|year=2006|isbn=978-0-262-63268-3|location=Oxford|pages=914}}</ref> With a few noteworthy deviations, the majority of connectionist research entered a period of inactivity until the mid-1980s.

The second wave began in the late 1980s, following the 1987 book about Parallel Distributed Processing by [[James L. McClelland]], [[David E. Rumelhart]] et al., which introduced a couple of improvements to the simple perceptron idea, such as intermediate processors (known as "[[hidden layers]]" now) alongside input and output units and used [[Sigmoid function|sigmoid]] [[activation function]] instead of the old 'all-or-nothing' function.

The current (third) wave has been marked by advances in [[Deep Learning]] allowing for [[Large language model]]s.<ref name="2019TheCuriousCaseOfConnectionism"/> The success of [[deep learning]] networks in the past decade has greatly increased the popularity of this approach, but the complexity and scale of such networks has brought with them increased [[Explainable artificial intelligence|interpretability problems]].<ref name=":0">{{cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2018/entries/connectionism/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|first=James|last=Garson|editor-first=Edward N.|editor-last=Zalta|date=27 November 2018|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|via=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}</ref> 

==Basic principle==
The central connectionist principle is that mental phenomena can be described by interconnected networks of simple and often uniform units. The form of the connections and the units can vary from model to model. For example, units in the network could represent [[neurons]] and the connections could represent [[synapses]], as in the [[human brain]]. This principle has been seen as an alternative to [[GOFAI]] and the classical [[theory of mind|theories of mind]] based on symbolic computation, but the extent to which the two approaches are compatible has been the subject of much debate since their inception.<ref name=":0" />

===Activation function===
{{Main|Activation function}}
Internal states of any network change over time due to neurons sending a signal to a succeeding layer of neurons in the case of a feedforward network, or to a previous layer in the case of a recurrent network. Discovery of non-linear activation functions has enabled the second wave of connectionism.

===Memory and learning===
{{Main|Artificial neural networks|Deep learning}}
Neural networks follow two basic principles:

# Any mental state can be described as an (N)-dimensional [[Vector (mathematics)|vector]] of numeric activation values over neural units in a network.
# Memory and learning are created by modifying the 'weights' of the connections between neural units, generally represented as an N×M [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]]. The weights are adjusted according to some [[learning rule]] or algorithm, such as [[Hebbian theory|Hebbian learning]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Novo|first1=María-Luisa|last2=Alsina|first2=Ángel|last3=Marbán|first3=José-María|last4=Berciano|first4=Ainhoa|date=2017|title=Connective Intelligence for Childhood Mathematics Education|journal=Comunicar|language=es|volume=25|issue=52|pages=29–39|doi=10.3916/c52-2017-03|issn=1134-3478|doi-access=free}}</ref>

Most of the variety among the models comes from:
* ''Interpretation of units'': Units can be interpreted as neurons or groups of neurons.
* ''Definition of activation'': Activation can be defined in a variety of ways. For example, in a [[Boltzmann machine]], the activation is interpreted as the probability of generating an action potential spike, and is determined via a [[logistic function]] on the sum of the inputs to a unit.
* ''Learning algorithm'': Different networks modify their connections differently. In general, any mathematically defined change in connection weights over time is referred to as the "learning algorithm".

===Biological realism===
Connectionist work in general does not need to be biologically realistic.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.encephalos.gr/48-1-01e.htm|title=Encephalos Journal|website=www.encephalos.gr|access-date=2018-02-20}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s-OCCwAAQBAJ&q=%22accurate%22&pg=PT18|title=Neural Geographies: Feminism and the Microstructure of Cognition|last=Wilson|first=Elizabeth A.|date=2016-02-04|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-95876-5|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Organismically-inspired robotics: homeostatic adaptation and teleology beyond the closed sensorimotor loop |s2cid=15349751}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Zorzi|first1=Marco|last2=Testolin|first2=Alberto|last3=Stoianov|first3=Ivilin P.|date=2013-08-20|title=Modeling language and cognition with deep unsupervised learning: a tutorial overview|journal=Frontiers in Psychology|volume=4|page=515|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00515|issn=1664-1078|pmc=3747356|pmid=23970869|doi-access=free}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://scholarworks.sjsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1015&context=comparativephilosophy|title=ANALYTIC AND CONTINENTAL PHILOSOPHY}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uV9TZzOITMwC&q=%22biological%20plausibility%22&pg=PA17|title=Neural Network Perspectives on Cognition and Adaptive Robotics|last=Browne|first=A.|date=1997-01-01|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0-7503-0455-9|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7pPv0STSos8C&q=%22biological+realism%22&pg=PA63|title=Connectionism in Perspective|last1=Pfeifer|first1=R.|last2=Schreter|first2=Z.|last3=Fogelman-Soulié|first3=F.|last4=Steels|first4=L.|date=1989-08-23|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-0-444-59876-9|language=en}}</ref> One area where connectionist models are thought to be biologically implausible is with respect to error-propagation networks that are needed to support learning,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Crick|first=Francis|date=January 1989|title=The recent excitement about neural networks|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=337|issue=6203|pages=129–132|doi=10.1038/337129a0|pmid=2911347|issn=1476-4687|bibcode=1989Natur.337..129C|s2cid=5892527}}</ref><ref name=":4">{{Cite journal|last1=Rumelhart|first1=David E.|last2=Hinton|first2=Geoffrey E.|last3=Williams|first3=Ronald J.|date=October 1986|title=Learning representations by back-propagating errors|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=323|issue=6088|pages=533–536|doi=10.1038/323533a0|issn=1476-4687|bibcode=1986Natur.323..533R|s2cid=205001834}}</ref> but error propagation can explain some of the biologically-generated electrical activity seen at the scalp in [[event-related potential]]s such as the [[N400 (neuroscience)|N400]] and [[P600 (neuroscience)|P600]],<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Fitz|first1=Hartmut|last2=Chang|first2=Franklin|date=2019-06-01|title=Language ERPs reflect learning through prediction error propagation|journal=Cognitive Psychology|volume=111|pages=15–52|doi=10.1016/j.cogpsych.2019.03.002|pmid=30921626|issn=0010-0285|hdl=21.11116/0000-0003-474F-6|s2cid=85501792|hdl-access=free}}</ref> and this provides some biological support for one of the key assumptions of connectionist learning procedures. Many recurrent connectionist models also incorporate [[dynamical systems theory]]. Many researchers, such as the connectionist [[Paul Smolensky]], have argued that connectionist models will evolve toward fully [[Continuous function|continuous]], high-dimensional, [[non-linear]], [[dynamic systems]] approaches. 

==Precursors==
Precursors of the connectionist principles can be traced to early work in [[psychology]], such as that of [[William James]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Anderson  |first1= James A.|last2=Rosenfeld |first2= Edward |date= 1989|title= Neurocomputing: Foundations of Research|publisher= A Bradford Book |page= 1|chapter = Chapter 1: (1890) William James ''Psychology (Brief Course)'' |isbn=978-0-262-51048-6 }}</ref> Psychological theories based on knowledge about the human brain were fashionable in the late 19th century.  As early as 1869, the neurologist [[John Hughlings Jackson]] argued for multi-level, distributed systems. Following from this lead, [[Herbert Spencer]]'s ''Principles of Psychology'', 3rd edition (1872), and [[Sigmund Freud]]'s ''Project for a Scientific Psychology'' (composed 1895) propounded connectionist or proto-connectionist theories. These tended to be speculative theories. But by the early 20th century, [[Edward Thorndike]] was experimenting on learning that posited a connectionist type network. 

[[Friedrich Hayek]] independently conceived the [[Hebbian theory|Hebbian synapse learning model]] in a paper presented in 1920 and developed that model into global brain theory constituted of networks Hebbian synapses building into larger systems of maps and memory network.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}} Hayek's breakthrough work was cited by Frank Rosenblatt in his perceptron paper.

==The first wave==
The first wave begun in 1943 with [[Warren Sturgis McCulloch]] and [[Walter Pitts]] both focusing on comprehending neural circuitry through a formal and mathematical approach, and [[Frank Rosenblatt]] who published the 1958 book “The Perceptron: A Probabilistic Model For Information Storage and Organization in the Brain” in ''Psychological Review'', while working at the Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory.<ref name="2019TheCuriousCaseOfConnectionism"/> McCulloch and Pitts showed how neural systems could implement [[first-order logic]]: Their classic paper "A Logical Calculus of Ideas Immanent in Nervous Activity" (1943) is important in this development here. They were influenced by the important work of [[Nicolas Rashevsky]] in the 1930s. [[Donald O. Hebb|Hebb]] contributed greatly to speculations about neural functioning, and proposed a learning principle, [[Hebbian learning]], that is still used today. [[Karl Lashley|Lashley]] argued for distributed representations as a result of his failure to find anything like a localized [[Engram (neuropsychology)|engram]] in years of [[lesion]] experiments. Another form of connectionist model was the [[Stratificational linguistics|relational network]] framework developed by the [[linguist]] [[Sydney Lamb]] in the 1960s.

==The second wave==
The second wave begun in late 1980s, following the 1987 book about the Parallel Distributed Processing by [[James L. McClelland]], [[David E. Rumelhart]] et al., which has introduced a couple of improvements to the simple perceptron idea, such as intermediate processors (known as "[[hidden layers]]" now) alongside input and output units and using [[Sigmoid function|sigmoid]] [[activation function]] instead of the old 'all-or-nothing' function. Their work has, in turn, built upon [[John Hopfield]], who was a key figure investigating the mathematical characteristics of sigmoid activation functions.<ref name="2019TheCuriousCaseOfConnectionism"/> A lot of the research that led to the development of PDP was done in the 1970s, although the term "connectionism" was not used. The first [[deep learning]] MLP was published by [[Alexey Grigorevich Ivakhnenko]] and Valentin Lapa in 1965 in [[Ukraine|USSS ('''Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic''')]], as the [[Group method of data handling|Group Method of Data Handling]].<ref name=DLhistory>{{cite arXiv|last=Schmidhuber|first=Juergen|author-link=Juergen Schmidhuber|date=2022|title=Annotated History of Modern AI and Deep Learning |class=cs.NE|eprint=2212.11279}}</ref><ref name="ivak1965">{{cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=FhwVNQAACAAJ}}|title=Cybernetic Predicting Devices|last=Ivakhnenko|first=A.

==Connectionism vs. computationalism debate==
As connectionism became increasingly popular in the late 1980s, some researchers (including [[Jerry Fodor]], [[Steven Pinker]] and others) reacted against it.  They argued that connectionism, as then developing, threatened to obliterate what they saw as the progress being made in the fields of cognitive science and psychology by the classical approach of [[computationalism]]. Computationalism is a specific form of cognitivism that argues that mental activity is [[Computing|computational]], that is, that the mind operates by performing purely formal operations on symbols, like a [[Turing machine]].  Some researchers argued that the trend in connectionism represented a reversion toward [[associationism]] and the abandonment of the idea of a [[language of thought]], something they saw as mistaken. In contrast, those very tendencies made connectionism attractive for other researchers.

Connectionism and computationalism need not be at odds, but the debate in the late 1980s and early 1990s led to opposition between the two approaches.  Throughout the debate, some researchers have argued that connectionism and computationalism are fully compatible, though full consensus on this issue has not been reached.  Differences between the two approaches include the following:

* Computationalists posit symbolic models that are structurally similar to underlying brain structure, whereas connectionists engage in "low-level" modeling, trying to ensure that their models resemble neurological structures.
* Computationalists in general focus on the structure of explicit symbols ([[mental models]]) and [[syntactical]] rules for their internal manipulation, whereas connectionists focus on learning from environmental stimuli and storing this information in a form of connections between neurons.
* Computationalists believe that internal mental activity consists of manipulation of explicit symbols, whereas connectionists believe that the manipulation of explicit symbols provides a poor model of mental activity.
* Computationalists often posit [[domain specificity|domain specific]] symbolic sub-systems designed to support learning in specific areas of cognition (e.g., language, intentionality, number), whereas connectionists posit one or a small set of very general learning-mechanisms.

Despite these differences, some theorists have proposed that the connectionist architecture is simply the manner in which organic brains happen to implement the symbol-manipulation system. This is logically possible, as it is well known that connectionist models can implement symbol-manipulation systems of the kind used in computationalist models,<ref name=":3">{{Cite journal|last=Chang|first=Franklin|date=2002|title=Symbolically speaking: a connectionist model of sentence production|journal=Cognitive Science|language=en|volume=26|issue=5|pages=609–651|doi=10.1207/s15516709cog2605_3|issn=1551-6709|doi-access=free}}</ref> as indeed they must be able if they are to explain the human ability to perform symbol-manipulation tasks. Several cognitive models combining both symbol-manipulative and connectionist architectures have been proposed. Among them are [[Paul Smolensky]]'s Integrated Connectionist/Symbolic Cognitive Architecture (ICS).<ref name=":0" /><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Smolensky|first=Paul|date=1990|title=Tensor Product Variable Binding and the Representation of Symbolic Structures in Connectionist Systems|url=http://www.lscp.net/persons/dupoux/teaching/AT1_2012/papers/Smolensky_1990_TensorProductVariableBinding.AI.pdf|journal=Artificial Intelligence|volume=46|issue=1–2|pages=159–216|doi=10.1016/0004-3702(90)90007-M}}</ref> and [[Ron Sun]]'s [[CLARION (cognitive architecture)]].  But the debate rests on whether this symbol manipulation forms the foundation of cognition in general, so this is not a potential vindication of computationalism. Nonetheless, computational descriptions may be helpful high-level descriptions of cognition of logic, for example.

The debate was largely centred on logical arguments about whether connectionist networks could produce the syntactic structure observed in this sort of reasoning. This was later achieved although using fast-variable binding abilities outside of those standardly assumed in connectionist models.<ref name=":3" /><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Shastri|first1=Lokendra|last2=Ajjanagadde|first2=Venkat|date=September 1993|title=From simple associations to systematic reasoning: A connectionist representation of rules, variables and dynamic bindings using temporal synchrony|journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences|language=en|volume=16|issue=3|pages=417–451|doi=10.1017/S0140525X00030910|s2cid=14973656|issn=1469-1825}}</ref>

Part of the appeal of computational descriptions is that they are relatively easy to interpret, and thus may be seen as contributing to our understanding of particular mental processes, whereas connectionist models are in general more opaque, to the extent that they may be describable only in very general terms (such as specifying the learning algorithm, the number of units, etc.), or in unhelpfully low-level terms. In this sense, connectionist models may instantiate, and thereby provide evidence for, a broad theory of cognition (i.e., connectionism), without representing a helpful theory of the particular process that is being modelled. In this sense, the debate might be considered as to some extent reflecting a mere difference in the level of analysis in which particular theories are framed. Some researchers suggest that the analysis gap is the consequence of connectionist mechanisms giving rise to [[Emergence|emergent phenomena]] that may be describable in computational terms.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ellis|first=Nick C.|date=1998|title=Emergentism, Connectionism and Language Learning|url=http://www-personal.umich.edu/~ncellis/NickEllis/Publications_files/Emergentism.pdf|journal=Language Learning|volume=48|issue=4|pages=631–664|doi=10.1111/0023-8333.00063}}</ref>

In the 2000s, the popularity of [[Cognitive Model#Dynamical systems|dynamical systems]] in [[philosophy of mind]] have added a new perspective on the debate;<ref>{{Citation |last=Van Gelder |first=Tim |year=1998 |title=The dynamical hypothesis in cognitive science |journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences |volume=21 |issue=5 |pages=615-28; discussion 629-65 |doi=10.1017/S0140525X98001733 |pmid=10097022 |url= https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/S0140525X98271731 |access-date=28 May 2022}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last=Beer |first=Randall D. |date=March 2000 |title=Dynamical approaches to cognitive science |journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences |volume=4 |issue=3 |pages=91–99 |doi=10.1016/s1364-6613(99)01440-0 |pmid=10689343 |s2cid=16515284 |issn=1364-6613}}</ref> some authors{{which|date=February 2016}} now argue that any split between connectionism and computationalism is more conclusively characterized as a split between computationalism and [[Cognitive Model#Dynamical systems|dynamical systems]].

In 2014, [[Alex Graves (computer scientist)|Alex Graves]] and others from [[DeepMind]] published a series of papers describing a novel Deep Neural Network structure called the [[Neural Turing Machine]]<ref>{{cite arXiv|last1=Graves|first1=Alex|title=Neural Turing Machines|eprint=1410.5401|class=cs.NE|year=2014}}</ref> able to read symbols on a tape and store symbols in memory. Relational Networks, another Deep Network module published by DeepMind, are able to create object-like representations and manipulate them to answer complex questions. Relational Networks and Neural Turing Machines are further evidence that connectionism and computationalism need not be at odds.

In order to be an adequate alternative theory of cognition, Smolensky's Subsymbolic Paradigm would have to explain the existence of systematicity or systematic relations in language cognition without the assumption that cognitive processes are causally sensitive to the classical constituent structure of mental representations. The subsymbolic paradigm, or connectionism in general, would thus have to explain the existence of systematicity and compositionality without relying on the mere implementation of a classical cognitive architecture. This challenge implies a dilemma: If the Subsymbolic Paradigm could contribute nothing to the systematicity and compositionality of mental representations, it would be insufficient as a basis for an alternative theory of cognition. However, if the Subsymbolic Paradigm's contribution to systematicity requires mental processes grounded in the classical constituent structure of mental representations, the theory of cognition it develops would be, at best, an implementation architecture of the classical model of symbol theory and thus not a genuine alternative (connectionist) theory of cognition.<ref>J.A.
