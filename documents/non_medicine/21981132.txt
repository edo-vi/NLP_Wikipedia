==Context==
==Laws==
In response to animal welfare and animal cruelty concerns, a number of laws have passed regulating rodeo. In the United Kingdom the [[Protection of Animals Act 1934]] effectively made rodeo, as it was then practiced, illegal in England, Scotland and Wales.<ref>{{cite book|author-link=Robert Garner|first=Robert|last=Garner|date=1993|title=Animals, Politics and Morality|publisher=Manchester University Press|page=88|isbn=0-7190-3574-0}}</ref>  In September 2000, California became the first American state to prohibit the use of prods on any animal in a chute.<ref name=curnutt>{{cite book |last=Curnutt |first=Jordan |title=Animals and the Law |publisher=ABC-CLIO |location=Santa Barbara |year=2001 |isbn=1-57607-147-2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p2p0MptGeBkC&q=Rodeo+events&pg=PA268}}</ref>{{Rp|268}}

==Independent assessments== 
Modern rodeos in the United States are closely regulated and have responded to accusations of [[animal cruelty]] by instituting a number of rules to guide how rodeo animals are to be managed.<ref name=PRCApdf>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080411122325/http://www.prorodeo.com/pdfs/AnimalWelfare.pdf ''Animal Welfare: The Care and Treatment of Professional Rodeo Livestock.''

In 1994, a survey of 28 sanctioned rodeos was conducted by on-site independent veterinarians.  Reviewing  animal runs, the injury rate was documented 0.047% (16 animals in 33,991 runs.<ref name="Sellnow2002">{{cite web|url=http://www.thehorse.com/ViewArticle.aspx?ID=3233|author=Sellnow, L.|date=January 1, 2002|title=Rodeo horses|publisher=The Horse}}</ref>

In 2000, a survey conducted by independent veterinarians at 57 PRCA rodeos found 0.053% (38 animal injuries in 71,743 animal exposures).<ref name="Schonholtz2012">{{cite web|author=Schonholtz, C.|title=Professional rodeo horses are bred to buck |date=January 16, 2012|url=http://www.naiaonline.org/articles/article/professional-rodeo-horses-are-bred-to-buck#sthash.4WAHrlNx.dpbs|access-date=May 28, 2012|publisher=National Animal Interest Alliance}}</ref>

A 2001 survey reported an injury rate of 0.056% in 21 PRCA rodeos (15 animals in 26,584 performances).<ref name="AVMA2001">{{cite journal|author=AVMA|title=Welfare of animals integral part of professional rodeos |date=January 15, 2001|publisher=American Veterinary Medical Association|url=http://www.avma.org/onlnews/javma/jan01/s011501tt.asp|journal=Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association |volume=218 |issue=2001–01–15 |pages=183; 185 |year=2001 |access-date=2009-03-25 |pmid=11195811 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120524205321/http://www.avma.org/onlnews/javma/jan01/s011501tt.asp |archive-date=2012-05-24 }}</ref>

A later PRCA survey of 60,971 animal performances at 198 rodeo performances and 73 sections of "slack" (competitions outside of the main competition events) indicated 27 animals were injured, i.e. 0.04%<ref name="PRCApdf"/>

In Australian rodeos, similar injury rates occur.  Basic injuries occur at a rate of 0.072% (one in 1,405), with injuries requiring veterinary attention at 0.036% (one injury each 2,810 times an animal is used in competition).<ref name="Australian">{{cite web|title=Animals in rodeo|publisher=Australian Professional Rodeo Association|author=Welfare of animals integral part of professional rodeos|access-date=May 28, 2016|url=http://www.prorodeo.com.au/files/uploaded/file/animalwelfare}}</ref>

Accusations of cruelty in US rodeos persist.  The PRCA acknowledges they sanction only about 30% of all rodeos, another 50% are sanctioned by other organizations and 20% are completely unsanctioned.<ref name=PRCApdf/> Several [[animal rights]] and animal welfare organizations keep records of accidents and incidents of possible animal abuse.<ref>[http://www.sharkonline.org/abuseinherent.mv SHARK] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111110002548/http://www.sharkonline.org/abuseinherent.mv |date=2011-11-10 }}''Animal Abuse Inherent in Rodeo''.
