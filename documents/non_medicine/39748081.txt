{{short description|Match-fixing, hazing and others}}
[[sumo|Professional sumo]] has had several controversies over its long history. These include proven allegations of match-fixing to hazing.

==Match-fixing==

{{Main|Match-fixing in professional sumo}}
[[File:Kiyoseumi 2010 Jan.JPG|thumb|200px|[[Kiyoseumi Takayuki|Kiyoseumi]] was forced to retire after an investigation found him guilty of match-fixing.]]
Due to the hierarchical structure of the sport, where top ranked wrestlers have great advantages in salary and status over lower ranked wrestlers, speculation about the existence of match-fixing and isolated reports of match fixing have surfaced over the years.<ref>Hongo, Jun, "[https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2011/02/09/national/sumo-rigging-born-of-necessity/ Sumo-rigging born of necessity?]", ''[[Japan Times]]'', February 9, 2011, p. 3.</ref><ref>[[Kyodo News]], "[https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2011/02/10/national/ex-sumo-attendant-says-match-fixing-nothing-new/#.XvsGpaZ7nYU Ex-sumo attendant says match-fixing nothing new]", ''[[Japan Times]]'', February 10, 2011, p. 1.</ref> The [[Japan Sumo Association]] (JSA) repeatedly denied any wrestlers were involved in match-fixing, known as ''yaocho'', and even took publishers to court over such allegations.<ref name="japantimes2">Martin, Alex, and Mizuho Aoki, "[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20110203x2.html Are fixed bouts final nail in sumo coffin?]", ''[[Japan Times]]'', February 4, 2011, p. 2.</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,24442805-25837,00.html|title=Ex-sumo wrestler claims bout-fixing is rife|work=The Australian|date=October 4, 2008|accessdate=October 4, 2008|first=Peter|last=Alford|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006192356/http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,24442805-25837,00.html|archive-date=October 6, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref>

However, in 2011, it was announced that an investigation by police had discovered cell phone text messages indicating that a number of matches had been fixed.<ref>Buerk, Roland, "[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-12342670 Japan's sumo hit by match-fixing claims]", ''[[BBC News]]'', 2 February 2010.

All of the wrestlers judged to be involved were forced to retire.

The JSA's investigative panel stated in May 2011 that match-fixing appears to have been widespread. The panel stated that it would be difficult to discover, however, the full extent of the problem.<ref>[[Kyodo News]], "[https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2011/05/20/national/sumo-panel-concedes-match-fixing-deep-rooted/ Sumo panel concedes match-fixing deep-rooted]", ''[[Japan Times]]'', May 20, 2011, p. 2.</ref> The May 2011 tournament went ahead but with no sponsorship, live TV coverage or trophy presentations, and was referred to as the "Technical Examination Tournament" with free admission to spectators.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/sports/2019/05/20/sumo/sumo-101-cancellations/ |title=Sumo 101: Cancellations|last=Gunning|first=John|date=20 May 2019|publisher=Japan Times|access-date=27 June 2023}}</ref>

One wrestler charged with match-fixing, [[Sōkokurai]], strenuously denied any involvement and won a court case in early 2013 deeming his dismissal groundless. He was subsequently reinstated by the JSA, and appeared in the July 2013 tournament in the top division.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/sports/2013/04/04/sumo/jsa-wont-appeal-court-ruling-to-reinstate-sokukurai/|title=JSA won't appeal court ruling to reinstate Sokukurai|date=4 April 2013|publisher=Japan Times|accessdate=8 June 2013|newspaper=The Japan Times Online}}</ref>

==Gambling and yakuza ties==
On July 4, 2010, the Japan Sumo Association announced its decision to dismiss the ''[[Makuuchi#Ōzeki|ōzeki]]'' [[Kotomitsuki Keiji|Kotomitsuki]] and the stablemaster Ōtake, former [[Takatōriki Tadashige|Takatōriki]], for betting on baseball games in a gambling ring run by the [[yakuza]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10503509|title=Top sumo wrestler fired over illegal gambling|publisher=BBC |date=July 4, 2010|accessdate=August 31, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Sumo Figures Barred in Japan for Gambling|work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/05/world/asia/05sumo.html?_r=1&scp=1&sq=sumo%20gambling&st=cse|first=Martin|last=Fackler|date=July 4, 2010|accessdate=July 6, 2010}}</ref> At the same time, two stable masters were demoted and an unprecedented 18 wrestlers banned from the July 2010 tournament.<ref name="nyt20100706">{{cite news|title=Sumo's Ties to Japan Underworld Go Beyond Limits|work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/06/world/asia/06sumo.html?pagewanted=1&hp|first=Martin|last=Fackler|date=July 5, 2010|accessdate=July 6, 2010}}</ref> The betting scandal resulted in public broadcaster [[NHK]] opting not to air live sumo matches during the tournament, instead showing a daily highlight package. A number of sponsors also withdrew their support for the tournament.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/scandal-slams-sumo-tournament-broadcast-25247/|title=Scandal slams sumo tournament broadcast|last=Blair|first=Gavin|date=6 July 2010|website=hollywoodreporter.com|publisher=Associated Press|access-date=30 June 2023}}</ref> Sumo Association chairman [[Kaiketsu Masateru|Hanaregoma]] declared in August 2010 that "violent groups or antisocial forces" were being banned from accessing tournament venues, training [[heya (sumo)|stables]] and other facilities.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/a12d0236-b454-11df-8208-00144feabdc0|title=Sumo vows to cut ties with yakuza|last=Dickie|first=Mure|date=30 August 2010|publisher=Financial Times|accessdate=6 December 2017}}</ref>

Three months before Hanaregoma's announcement, Japan's largest yakuza group, [[Yamaguchi-gumi]], bought fifty prized seats during a tournament so that gangsters were prominently visible during the national broadcast of the match. According to experts, this was an endeavor to cheer up an incarcerated boss.<ref name="nyt20100706" /> Although there have always been alleged ties between sumo and the yakuza, the sport has suffered from waning public interest and sponsorship during the economic recession, which may have contributed to closer ties to the underworld for financial support.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/opinion/2010/07/27/commentary/world-commentary/sumos-and-the-yakuza/|title=Sumos and the yakuza|last=Matsumura|first=Masahiro|date=27 July 2010|publisher=Japan Times|accessdate=6 December 2017}}</ref>

In December 2021 ''[[sekitori]]'' wrestlers [[Hidenoumi Takuya|Hidenoumi]] and {{Interlanguage link multi|Shiden Taukumi|ja|3=芝匠|lt=Shiden}} were withdrawn from the January 2022 tournament for suspected involvement in [[Gambling_in_Japan#Illegal_gambling|illegal gambling]]. During the investigation into an illegal establishment in [[Sōka|Sōka, Saitama Prefecture]] that was [[Police raid|raided]] in September 2021, suspicions were raised by the [[Saitama Prefecture|Saitama]] [[Prefectural police department|Prefectural Police]] about the involvement of both Hidenoumi and Shiden, as well as other sumo wrestlers that may have possibly participated.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nikkansports.com/battle/sumo/news/202201070001178.html|title=英乃海と紫雷、賭博関与疑いで事情聴取　埼玉草加市の違法賭博店への出入り|date=7 January 2022|work=Nikkan Sports|language=Japanese|access-date=7 January 2022}}</ref> During the January 2022 ''basho'' Japanese media reported that the Sumo Association's compliance committee, after holding hearings, concluded that Hidenoumi and Shiden participated in illegal gambling.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nikkansports.com/battle/sumo/news/202201150001049.html|title=英乃海と紫雷が違法賭博行為認める　27日の定例理事会で最終処分決定へ|date=15 January 2022|publisher=Nikkan Sports|language=ja|access-date=16 January 2022}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://japantoday.com/category/sports/sumo-association-probe-found-2-wrestlers-gambled-illegally-source|title=Sumo association probe finds 2 wrestlers gambled illegally: source|date=16 January 2022|website=japantoday.com|publisher=Kyodo News|access-date=16 January 2022}}</ref> Following the tournament's conclusion, the Sumo Association suspended Hidenoumi for one tournament (retroactive to January 2022) and issued a 20% salary cut for two months.

==Hazing and violence==
===Tokitsukaze hazing scandal===
{{main|Tokitsukaze stable hazing scandal}}

It has been well-known and accepted for many years that sumo stables engage in the systematic hazing and physical punishment of young disciples in order to "toughen them up".<ref name=BBOS>{{cite book |last= Hall |first= Mina |title= The Big Book of Sumo: History, Practice, Ritual, Fight |publisher= Stone Bridge Press |year= 1997 |isbn= 978-1-880656-28-0 |url-access= registration |url= https://archive.org/details/bigbookofsumohis00hall }}</ref> Stable masters have often been proud to show to the media how they frequently use a ''[[shinai]]'' to beat those who fall out of line, and elder wrestlers are often put in charge of bullying younger ones to keep them in line, for instance, by making them hold heavy objects for long periods of time.<ref name=BBOS/>
However, this system of hazing was widely criticized in late 2007 when a hazing scandal came to light, in which a 17-year-old sumo trainee named Takashi Saito from the [[Tokitsukaze stable]] died after a serious bullying incident involving his stablemaster [[Futatsuryū Jun'ichi|Jun'ichi Yamamoto]] hitting him on the head with a large beer bottle and fellow rikishi being subsequently ordered to physically abuse him further. The stablemaster and three other wrestlers who were involved were arrested in February 2008, after which [[Prime Minister of Japan|Japanese Prime Minister]] [[Yasuo Fukuda]] demanded the JSA take steps to ensure such an incident never happens again.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7235156.stm|title=Japan PM angry over Sumo death|publisher=BBC |date=February 8, 2008 |accessdate=February 8, 2008 |first=Steve |last=Jackson}}</ref> In May 2009, Yamamoto was sentenced to six years in jail.<ref>{{cite news|title=Sumo trainer jailed over killing|publisher=BBC News  |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/8073297.stm|date=May 29, 2009|accessdate=June 1, 2009}}</ref>

===Other scandals===
Violent affairs also came to light in 2017, when ''[[Sports Nippon]]'' reported that ''yokozuna'' [[Harumafuji]] had assaulted another wrestler ([[Takanoiwa Yoshimori|Takanoiwa]]) during a regional sumo tour in [[Tottori, Tottori|Tottori]]. According to the article, Harumafuji was allegedly drinking with other sumo wrestlers<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mainichi.jp/english/articles/20171115/p2g/00m/0dm/081000c|title=Police probing Harumafuji's alleged assault on fellow sumo wrestler|date=15 November 2017|publisher=The Manichi|access-date=15 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171115150831/http://mainichi.jp/english/articles/20171115/p2g/00m/0dm/081000c|archive-date=15 November 2017}}</ref> and admonished Takanoiwa because he was looking at his cell phone. Harumafuji struck him in the head with a beer bottle and punched him 20 to 30 times.<ref name=kyodo151117>{{cite web |url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2017/11/15/national/crime-legal/drunken-brawl-shines-light-sumos-hidden-underbelly/|title=Drunken brawl shines light on sumo's hidden underbelly|author=<!--Not stated--> |date=15 November 2017|website=www.japantimes.co.jp|publisher=Kyodo News|access-date=15 November 2017}}</ref> Questioned by the Sumo Association's crisis management panel, Harumafuji admitted to assaulting Takanoiwa.<ref name=kyodo211117>{{cite web |url=https://english.kyodonews.net/news/2017/11/efd2df0736f8-harumafuji-to-be-referred-to-prosecutors-for-assault.html|title=Harumafuji to be referred to prosecutors for assault|date=21 November 2017|access-date=22 November 2017|publisher=Kyodo News}}</ref> This case triggered the launch of new procedures to ensure that scandals of violence would not be repeated within the Association and in 2018, the Association issued an official statement on the subject.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sumo.or.jp/IrohaKyokaiSocialResponsibility/ketsubetsu|title=Declaration of farewell to violence|work=Japan Sumo Association|language=Ja|access-date=November 23, 2022}}</ref>

However, hazing and violence has not disappeared from professional sumo and, in December 2022, [[Asahifuji Seiya|Isegahama]]-oyakata announced his resignation as director after two junior wrestlers in [[Isegahama stable (2007)|his stable]] acted violently against younger wrestlers, with the victims beaten with wooden beams and burned with [[chankonabe]] hot water poured on their backs.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nikkansports.com/battle/sumo/news/202212260001091.html|title=Isegahama-oyakata resigns from director: Two makushita sumo wrestlers violently pour hot water on younger disciples|date=26 December 2022|work=Nikkan Sports|language=ja|access-date=26 December 2022}}</ref>

In March 2023 a former lower-ranked wrestler in [[Sadogatake stable]], Daisuke Yanagihara, sued the Japan Sumo Association and his former stablemaster Sadogatake (ex-[[Kotonowaka Terumasa|Kotonowaka]]) on allegations that he was forced to quit the sport. Yanagihara claimed that his [[human rights]] were violated and that, during the [[COVID-19 pandemic]] when the Sumo Association instituted health protocols, Sadogatake denied his request to sit out of the January 2021 tournament over fears of contracting the virus following [[cardiac surgery]]. In the lawsuit, Yanagihara also alleged mistreatment of lower-ranked wrestlers in his former stable, such as being served meals containing meat that was years beyond its expiration date. As of July 2023 the Sumo Association has not commented on the allegations.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.barrons.com/news/former-wrestler-sues-japan-sumo-body-for-alleged-mistreatment-f8003f34?refsec=topics_afp-news|title=Former Wrestler Sues Japan Sumo Body For Alleged Mistreatment|date=31 July 2023|website=barrons.com|publisher=[[Agence France-Presse]]|access-date=31 July 2023}}</ref>

In May 2023, [[Michinoku stable]] was also the subject of a controversy because a senior wrestler, Kirinofuji, assaulted another young wrestler, Yasunishi, with a frying pan and whipped him with a jump rope. Stablemaster [[Kirishima Kazuhiro|Michinoku]] was then accused of having covered these facts of violence by contributing directly to the fact that the aggressor can remain within the stable in a first time, then, in a second time, to the fact that the aggressor can retire with dignity and without any charges brought against him. [[Daijuyama Tadaaki|Hanakago]]-oyakata, the director of the [[Japan Sumo Association#Association organization|Compliance Department]], is also implicated for having let the aggressor go unpunished, despite having been informed late and by the victim.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nikkansports.com/battle/sumo/news/202305090001511.html|title=Violence in Michinoku stable "I have told the association. I am not hiding anything," said the master. The assailant retired.|date=9 May 2023|work=Nikkan Sports|language=ja|access-date=11 May 2023}}</ref>

==Harassment claims and failed properly paid overtime==
In October 2023 it was revealed that several employees of the [[Japan Sumo Association]] had lodged complaints with the Board of Directors about the supervision of certain non-[[toshiyori|elder]] managers. After an investigation, it was revealed that the administrative affairs chief and the head of the office in charge of accounting were responsible for numerous irregularities dating back to 2017 concerning the payment of overtime pay for an estimated amount of 100 million yen (~$667,870/€637,712). Having initially sought to resolve the problem internally in August, the Association received twelve formal complaints from staff who were dissatisfied with the way the matter was being handled. At the same time, it was also reported that the same two managers had unilaterally reduced the salaries of certain employees, restricted access to the computer server and asked intrusive questions to women during recruitment interviews about their pregnancy and childbirth plans. Finally, it was also confirmed that both men had verbally abused employees. In response to these actions, the Sumo Association decided to suspend its administrative affairs chief for one month, and demote the head of the office in charge of accounting by one rank in the Association hierarchy.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sumo association officials punished over harassment claims|url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/sports/2023/10/01/sumo/sumo-association-harassment/|work=The Japan Times|url-access=subscription|date=1 October 2023|access-date=3 October 2023}}</ref>

==Health effects==
The sumo lifestyle has negative health effects which become apparent later in life. Sumo wrestlers have a [[life expectancy]] between 60 and 65, more than 20 years shorter than the average Japanese male, as the diet and sport take a toll on the wrestler's body. Many develop [[type 2 diabetes]] or [[Hypertension|high blood pressure]], and they are prone to heart attacks due to the enormous amount of body mass and fat that they accumulate. The excessive intake of [[alcoholic drink|alcohol]] can lead to [[Alcoholic liver disease|liver problems]] and the stress on their joints due to their excess weight can cause [[arthritis]]. Recently, the standards of weight gain are becoming less strict, in an effort to improve the overall health of the wrestlers.<ref>{{cite web | title=Becoming a Sumo Wrestler | work=Sumo East and West | publisher=[[Discovery Channel]] | url=http://www.discoverychannelasia.com/sumo/become_a_sumo_wrestler/index.shtml | access-date=November 18, 2005 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050831220303/http://discoverychannelasia.com/sumo/become_a_sumo_wrestler/index.shtml | archive-date=August 31, 2005 | df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=United Nations Statistics Division – Demographic and Social Statistics | url=http://unstats.un.org/unsd/demographic/products/dyb/dyb2.htm | access-date=November 18, 2005 }}</ref>

==Women and sumo==
{{main|Women's sumo}}
Professional sumo excludes women from competition and ceremonies. Women are not allowed to enter or touch the sumo wrestling ring (''[[dohyō]]''), a tradition stemming from Shinto and Buddhist beliefs that women are "impure" because of menstrual blood.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Yoshida |first1=Reiji |title=Banning women from the sumo ring: centuries-old tradition, straight-up sexism or something more complex? |url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2018/04/30/national/social-issues/banning-women-sumo-ring-sexism-centuries-old-cultural-tradition/ |accessdate=11 December 2019 |work=The Japan Times |date=30 April 2018}}</ref>

The female Governor of [[Osaka]] from 2000–2008, [[Fusae Ohta]], when called upon to present the Governor's Prize to the champion of the annual Osaka tournament, was required to do so on the walkway beside the ring or send a male representative in her place. She repeatedly challenged the JSA's policy by requesting to be allowed to fulfill her traditional role as Governor. Her requests were repeatedly rejected until the end of her five-year term.

In April 2018, during a non-tournament sumo event in [[Kyoto Prefecture]], two women rushed to the aid of the mayor of [[Maizuru]] when he collapsed in the middle of the ''dohyō''. While the women were attempting to provide emergency treatment, a referee repeatedly asked them to leave the ring. The chairman of the Sumo Association later apologized for what he called an inappropriate response, saying that he greatly appreciated the women's efforts.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/05/world/asia/women-sumo-ring-japan.html|title=Women Barred From Sumo Ring, Even to Save a Man's Life|last=Rich|first=Motoko|date=5 April 2018|website=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=5 April 2018}}</ref>

The view of those who criticize this continuing "men-only" policy is that it is discriminatory and oppressive.<ref Name=RDP>{{cite web | url=https://www.popmatters.com/columns/holden/000403.html|title=ReDotPop Sumo|publisher=[[PopMatters]]|date=April 5, 2000 |accessdate=March 12, 2008 }}</ref>
In general, women in the sumo world are only expected to be supportive wives of the wrestlers, and, in the case that their husband has become a stablemaster, a surrogate mother for all of his trainee wrestlers.<ref name=BBOS/>
The view of the JSA is that this is a tradition that has been firmly maintained through the centuries, so it would be a dishonor to all of their ancestors to change it.<ref Name=RDP/>

This was not always the case. Starting as early as the 18th century a form of {{nihongo|female sumo|女相撲|onnazumo}} was performed in some areas of Japan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://the-japan-news.com/news/article/0004365275|title=SUMO ABC (75) / Banning women from the dohyo is groundless in this day and age - The Japan News|last=Miki|first=Shuji|date=21 April 2018|publisher=Japan News/Yomiuri Shimbun|accessdate=23 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180423232756/http://the-japan-news.com/news/article/0004365275|archive-date=23 April 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> In the cities it was more of a spectacle often associated with brothels. However, in some areas of Japan female sumo had a serious role in certain Shinto rituals. In later years, there were limited tours of female sumo that lasted for a time.<ref>{{cite journal | title = Women's Sumo Wrestling in Japan | last = Ikkai | first = Chie | journal = International Journal of Sport and Health Science | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | pages = 178–181 | doi = 10.5432/ijshs.1.178 | year = 2003 | doi-access = free }}</ref> However, female sumo is not considered to be authentic by most Japanese and is now prohibited from taking place beyond amateur settings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eastwestmagazine.com/features/an-inside-look-at-shin-sumo |title=An Inside Look at Shin Sumo |publisher=Eastwest Lifestyle |date=June 2005 |accessdate=March 12, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091110052734/http://www.eastwestmagazine.com/features/an-inside-look-at-shin-Sumo |archivedate=November 10, 2009 }}</ref>
