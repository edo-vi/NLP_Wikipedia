'''''Rubber Johnny''''' is a 2005 British [[experimental film|experimental]] [[short film]]/[[music video]] written, directed, and produced by [[Chris Cunningham]].

==Plot==
The film, entirely presented in [[infrared vision]], begins with an out-of-focus closeup of Johnny (played by Cunningham) babbling incomprehensibly while being interviewed by an unseen man. At one point, Johnny mumbles the word "[[mother|ma-ma]]" twice, after which the man asks if he wants his mother to come in. This causes Johnny to start breathing erratically and lose control, so the man gives Johnny a sedative injection to calm him down.

The video cuts to a [[fluorescent light]] turning on, a mouse crawling over a press-sticker credits list, followed by the title, "Rubber Johnny", which is shown written on a condom in a backwards-playing shot of it being pulled off a penis.

Johnny sits recumbent in his wheelchair with his oversized head hanging over the back of it. He starts dancing to the [[Aphex Twin]] track "[[Drukqs|Afx237 v.7]]"<ref name="stylus">{{Cite web|title=Rubber Johnny - Movie Review -Stylus Magazine|url=https://www.stylusmagazine.com/feature_ID_1638.html |date=17 May 2005 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220216210016/https://www.stylusmagazine.com/feature_ID_1638.html |archive-date=16 February 2022}}</ref> while his [[Chihuahua (dog)|chihuahua]] watches. His dancing involves him performing balancing tricks with his wheelchair and deflecting light beams with his hands. A door opens and Johnny is interrupted by an aggressive male voice. During this, Johnny is sitting upright in the wheelchair. The voice yells at him indistinctly, a slap to Johnny's face is implied, and the door is slammed shut.

Johnny snorts a large line of [[cocaine]].<ref name="stylus" /> He screams in the dark and then hides behind a door, avoiding white light beams. Johnny's face smashes repeatedly into a glass surface, and each time chunks of his face articulate the vocals in the song. He is interrupted a second time by the voice, after which Johnny once again reclines back in his wheelchair and babbles at his chihuahua.

The credits roll over a night scene of a train passing in the distance.

==Production==
Shot on [[DV]] [[night-vision]], the film was made in Cunningham's own time as a home movie of sorts, and took three and half years of weekends to complete.<ref name='Telegraph'>{{cite news | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/3642759/Cheap-but-never-cheerful.html |title=Cheap but never cheerful |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180622170636/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/3642759/Cheap-but-never-cheerful.html |archive-date=22 June 2018|work =[[The Daily Telegraph]]| first = Chris | last = Campion | date = 28 May 2005}}</ref>

Cunningham explained that the effect of an exploding head was made using "just a [[tangerine]] and [[Plasticine]] with a banger inside it". He created some effects in his own kitchen instead of relying on [[Computer-generated imaging|CGI]].<ref name='Telegraph' />

==Reception==
{{expand section|date=October 2018}}

Pascal Wyse of ''[[The Guardian]]'' referred to it as "virtuosic grossness", stating, "there is more fleeting shock than real haunting. Perhaps, in all the synaptic mayhem, there is just no room for the viewer to contact their own demons."<ref name="wyserev">{{cite web |last=Wyse|first=Pascal |title=Chris Cunningham|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2010/apr/27/chris-cunningham-review|work=The Guardian|date=27 April 2010|access-date=15 October 2018}}</ref> ''Treble.com'' listed the film in its "10 Terrifying Music Videos", calling it "both hilarious and terrifying".<ref name="treblezinelist">{{cite web |title=10 Terrifying Music Videos |url=https://www.treblezine.com/32436-10-terrifying-music-videos/ |website=Treblezine|date=27 October 2016|access-date=15 October 2018}}</ref>

Writing for ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'', Chris Campion asserted that the video was "like a [[Looney Tunes]] short for a generation raised on [[video nasties]] and [[rave music]]".<ref name="Telegraph" />

S. McKeating of ''[[Stylus Magazine]]'' awarded ''Rubber Johnny'' a 'B+' rating, lauding it as an "exceptionally entertaining odd short film" but only for viewers "with the right frame of mind". He additionally demanded that Cunningham "take it one step further and give us an hour and a half of warped material".<ref name="stylus" />

Founder of [[fact-checking]] website ''[[Snopes]]'' David Mikkelson noted the circulation of claims that the film was a documentation of real happenings. He noted that the "film itself is difficult to describe in ordinary terms".<ref>{{Cite web |title=Rubber Johnny |url=https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/rubber-johnny/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220328183853/https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/rubber-johnny/ |archive-date=28 March 2022 |access-date=2022-08-14 |website=Snopes.com |language=en-US}}</ref>
