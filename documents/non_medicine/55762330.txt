===FBI failure to investigate and FBI false statements===
{{Update section|date=April 2022}}

On September 15, 2021, four elite American gymnasts, McKayla Maroney, Simone Biles, Maggie Nichols, and Aly Raisman, testified before the U.S. Senate regarding the mishandling by [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agents of abuse allegations brought against Nassar and how the agents made false statements regarding their reports and misinformation about the botched investigation.

Maroney testified that she was met with silence by an FBI agent after telling the agent of Nassar's "...&nbsp;molestations in extreme detail." She further stated that the FBI falsified her statement, said the agents involved should be indicted, and criticized Deputy Attorney General [[Lisa Monaco]] for not appearing at the hearing. Raisman testified that the FBI made her feel that the "abuse didn't count" but she felt it "was like serving innocent children up to a pedophile on a silver platter." After the testimony by the gymnasts, FBI Director [[Christopher A. Wray]] testified, speaking to the gymnasts that he was "deeply and profoundly sorry that so many people let you down over and over again."

According to a report issued in July&nbsp;2021 by the Department of Justice Inspector General Michael Horowitz, at least 70&nbsp;more athletes were subjected to abuse between the time of reports to the FBI and the arrest of Nassar by state authorities, while Nassar's victims stated that the number abused in that period was 120.<ref>{{cite news |last=Sneed |first=Tierney |title=McKayla Maroney: FBI made 'entirely false claims about what I said' |url=https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/15/politics/gymnasts-senate-judiciary-committee-larry-nassar-hearing/index.html |access-date=September 16, 2021 |work=[[CNN]] |date=September 15, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Naylor |first=Brian |date=September 15, 2021 |title=Gymnasts blast the FBI's mishandling of their allegations about Larry Nassar |work=[[NPR]] |url=https://www.npr.org/2021/09/15/1036968966/gymnasts-nassar-fbi-senate-hearing-simone-biles-aly-raisman-wray |access-date=September 16, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Barrett |first=Devlin |date=September 16, 2021 |title=Simone Biles to Congress: 'I blame Larry Nassar, and I also blame an entire system' |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/gymnasts-nassar-fbi-investigation-hearing/2021/09/14/de4832cc-159f-11ec-9589-31ac3173c2e5_story.html |access-date=September 16, 2021}}</ref>

On July&nbsp;11, 2017, Nassar pleaded guilty to receiving child pornography in 2004, possession of pornographic images of children dating from 2004 to 2016, and tampering with evidence by destroying and concealing the images. Judge [[Janet T.

On November 22, 2017, Nassar pleaded guilty in Ingham County Circuit Court to seven counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct with minors under the age of 16. He admitted to molesting seven girls, three of whom were under the age of 13.

That part of the sentence was purely symbolic, as Nassar’s federal and state sentences are consecutive, essentially guaranteeing he will die in prison. Aquilina allowed Nassar's accusers to present extended [[victim impact statement]]s and dismissed objections raised to this ruling by Nassar.<ref name="ESPNsentencing"/> During the sentencing, the judge informed Nassar that he had missed numerous chances to receive treatment for his sexual urges, as Nassar had been aware of these urges himself from a young age. She also said that there were likely dozens of additional victims who had not come forward, and made it clear that Nassar will never be free again.<ref name="CNN"/>

Nassar was practicing without a Texas [[medical license]] while he worked at the [[Karolyi Ranch]], which since 2001 had been the USA Gymnastics designated U.S. Women's National Gymnastics Training Center in Huntsville, Texas. According to [[McKayla Maroney]], this was where Nassar molested young women for more than 15&nbsp;years. Practicing medicine without a license in Texas is a third-degree felony, although it is rarely prosecuted.<ref>{{cite web |first1=Jori |last1=Epstein |first2=Terri |last2=Langford |date=January 24, 2018 |title=Ex-USA Gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar treated athletes in Texas without license, board confirms |publisher=[[The Dallas Morning News]] |url=https://sportsday.dallasnews.com/other-sports/moresports/2018/01/24/ex-usa-gymnastics-doctor-larry-nassar-treated-athletes-texas-without-license-board-confirms |access-date=January 24, 2018}}</ref> On January 31, 2018, a Michigan judge said that there were "over 265 identified victims and an infinite number of victims" of sexual misconduct.<ref name = "BBC News 2018"/>

====Incarceration====
Nassar spent time in the [[Eaton County, Michigan|Eaton County]] jail and the federal detention center at [[Federal Correctional Institution, Milan|FCI Milan]] near [[Milan, Michigan]]. In February 2018, he was transferred to the [[United States Penitentiary, Tucson|United States Penitentiary]] (USP) in [[Tucson, Arizona]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Mencarini |first=Matt |date=February 10, 2018 |title=Larry Nassar transferred to Arizona prison where Elizabeth Smart kidnapper, Mafia hit man reside |newspaper=[[USA Today]] |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2018/02/10/larry-nassar-transferred-federal-prison-arizona/326211002/ |access-date=April 5, 2018}}</ref> According to his lawyers, Nassar was assaulted almost as soon as he was placed in the general population at USP Tucson, and an investigation determined that Nassar could not be safely held at Tucson.<ref>{{cite news |last=Kozlowski |first=Kim |date=August 18, 2018 |title=Nassar transferred to a holdover prison after assault |newspaper=[[The Detroit News]] |url=https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/michigan/2018/08/19/nassar-transferred-holdover-prison-after-assault/1036296002/}}</ref> In August 2018, ''[[The Detroit News]]'' reported that Nassar was transferred to the [[Federal Transfer Center, Oklahoma City|Federal Transfer Center]] in [[Oklahoma City]], [[Oklahoma]], and was moved to the [[United States Penitentiary, Coleman]] in Florida shortly afterward,<ref>{{cite news |first=Des |last=Bieler |date=August 28, 2018 |title=Larry Nassar moved to Florida prison that also houses Whitey Bulger |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/amphtml/news/early-lead/wp/2018/08/28/larry-nassar-moved-to-florida-prison-that-also-houses-whitey-bulger/?noredirect=on}}</ref> where he would remain until July 2023.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |title=BOP: Federal Inmates By Name |url=https://www.bop.gov/mobile/find_inmate/byname.jsp#inmate_results |access-date=2023-08-21 |website=www.bop.gov}}</ref>

On July 9, 2023, Nassar was stabbed by another inmate who was upset by a lewd comment Nassar made about girls while they were watching Wimbledon on TV. He was stabbed twice in the neck, six times in the chest, twice in the back, and suffered a collapsed lung. He survived the attack in stable condition.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.yahoo.com/larry-nassar-reportedly-shivved-over-193213067.html |title=Larry Nassar Reportedly Shivved Over Gross Wimbledon Comment |first=Pilar |last=Melendez |date=July 12, 2023 |work=[[The Daily Beast]] |via=[[Yahoo!

Nassar's earliest potential release from federal prison is January 30, 2068. He will likely die serving his federal sentence, as it far exceeds [[human life expectancy]], and his earliest possible release will be when he is 104 years old. However, if Nassar is still alive when he becomes eligible for release from federal prison, upon his release he would be immediately transferred to a Michigan state prison to serve his concurrent state sentences. He would then have to serve a minimum of 40 years in state prison before being eligible for parole. Per Aquilina, if Nassar survives, he will have to register as a sex offender in Michigan for the rest of his life.

==Aftermath==
As of 2018, more than 150&nbsp;federal and state lawsuits had been filed against Nassar, Michigan State University, the US Olympic Committee, USA Gymnastics, and the Twistars Gymnastics Club.<ref>{{cite web |first1=Tracy |last1=Connor |first2=Elizabeth |last2=Chuck |date=January 24, 2018 |title=Gymnastics doctor scandal: What's next in the Larry Nassar case? |website=[[NBC News]] |url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/gymnastics-doctor-scandal-what-s-next-larry-nassar-case-n840781 |access-date=January 28, 2018}}</ref> The entire 18&nbsp;member board of USA Gymnastics, including [[Steve Penny]], tendered their resignations.

In 2019, [[HBO]] released a documentary about Nassar's serial sexual abuse and subsequent cover-ups by the various institutions he worked with, titled ''[[At the Heart of Gold: Inside the USA Gymnastics Scandal]]''. The 2020 [[Netflix]] documentary ''[[Athlete A]]'' is also based on Nassar's scandal and crimes.
