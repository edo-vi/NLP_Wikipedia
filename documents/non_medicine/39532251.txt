<!-- Definition and symptoms -->
'''Middle East respiratory syndrome''' ('''MERS''') is a viral [[respiratory infection]] caused by ''[[Middle East respiratory syndrome–related coronavirus]]'' (MERS-CoV).<ref name=WHO2019/> Symptoms may range from none, to mild, to severe depending on age and risk level <ref name=Lancet2015/><ref name=WHO2019/> Typical symptoms include [[fever]], [[cough]], [[diarrhea]], and [[shortness of breath]].<ref name=WHO2019/> The disease is typically more severe in those with other health problems.<ref name=WHO2019/><ref name=Lancet2015>{{cite journal | vauthors = Zumla A, Hui DS, Perlman S | title = Middle East respiratory syndrome | journal = Lancet | volume = 386 | issue = 9997 | pages = 995–1007 | date = September 2015 | pmid = 26049252 | pmc = 4721578 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(15)60454-8 }}</ref>

==Signs and symptoms==
[[File:Symptoms of MERS (raster).png|thumb|upright=1.3|Symptoms of MERS]]
Early reports compared the [[viruses]] to [[severe acute respiratory syndrome]] ([[SARS]]),<ref name=zaki8nov2012/> and it has been referred to as Saudi Arabia's SARS-like virus.<ref name=NPR26sep2012/> The first person, [[2012 Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus outbreak|in June 2012]], had a [[fever]], [[cough]], [[expectoration]], and shortness of breath.<ref name=zaki8nov2012/> One review of 47 laboratory confirmed cases in Saudi Arabia gave the most common presenting symptoms as fever in 98%, cough in 83%, shortness of breath in 72% and [[myalgia]] in 32% of people. There were also frequent gastrointestinal symptoms with diarrhea in 26%, vomiting in 21%, abdominal pain in 17% of people. 72% of people required [[mechanical ventilation]]. There were also 3.3 males for every female.<ref name=Assiri9sep2013/> One study of a hospital-based outbreak of MERS had an estimated [[incubation period]] of 5.5 days (95% [[confidence interval]] 1.9 to 14.7 days).<ref name=Assiri8jan2013/> MERS can range from asymptomatic disease to severe [[pneumonia]] leading to [[acute respiratory distress syndrome]] (ARDS).<ref name=Assiri9sep2013/> [[Kidney failure]], [[disseminated intravascular coagulation]] (DIC), and [[pericarditis]] have also been reported.<ref name=WHO2nov2013/>

==Cause==

===Virology===
{{Main|Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus}}
[[Image:MERS-CoV electron micrograph1.jpg|thumb|MERS coronaviruses under [[electron microscope]]]]

Middle East respiratory syndrome is caused by the [[Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus|MERS coronavirus]] (MERS-CoV), a species with [[RNA virus|single-stranded RNA]] belonging to the genus [[betacoronavirus]] which is distinct from [[SARS coronavirus]] and the common-cold coronavirus.<ref name=sciencenews27feb2013 /> Its genomes are phylogenetically classified into two [[clades]], Clades A and B. Early cases of MERS were of Clade A clusters (EMC/2012 and Jordan-N3/2012), while new cases are genetically different in general (Clade B).<ref>{{cite journal|title=MERS Coronaviruses in Dromedary Camels, Egypt|journal=Emerging Infectious Diseases|volume=20|issue=6|pages=1049–1053|date=June 2014|doi=10.3201/eid2006.140299|pmid=24856660|pmc=4036765|last1=Chu|first1=Daniel K.W.|last2=Poon|first2=Leo L.M.|last3=Gomaa|first3=Mokhtar M.|last4=Shehata|first4=Mahmoud M.|last5=Perera|first5=Ranawaka A.P.M.|last6=Abu Zeid|first6=Dina|last7=El Rifay|first7=Amira S.|last8=Siu|first8=Lewis Y.|last9=Guan|first9=Yi|last10=Webby|first10=Richard J.|last11=Ali|first11=Mohamed A.|last12=Peiris|first12=Malik|last13=Kayali|first13=Ghazi}}</ref> The virus grows readily on [[Vero cells]] and LLC-MK2 cells.<ref name="promedmail.org">{{cite web |title=See Also |publisher=[[ProMED-mail]] |date=20 September 2012 |url=http://www.promedmail.org/direct.php?id=20120920.1302733 |access-date=31 May 2013 |archive-date=27 May 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130527165625/http://www.promedmail.org/direct.php?id=20120920.1302733 |url-status=live }}</ref> In November 2012, Egyptian virologist [[Ali Mohamed Zaki|Dr. Ali Zaki]] sent a virus sample from the first confirmed case in Saudi Arabia to virologist [[Ron Fouchier]], a leading coronavirus researcher at the [[Erasmus Medical Center]] (EMC) in [[Rotterdam]], the Netherlands.<ref name="sampledisputeCTV23May2013"/> The second laboratory-proven case was in London, confirmed by the UK [[Health Protection Agency]] (HPA).<ref name="batLu">{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s13238-012-2811-1 |pmid=23143870 |pmc=4875465 |title=SARS-like virus in the Middle East: A truly bat-related coronavirus causing human diseases |journal=Protein & Cell |volume=3 |issue=11 |pages=803–805 |year=2012 |last1=Lu |first1=Guangwen |last2=Liu |first2=Di }}</ref><ref name="UK23sept2012"/> The HPA named the virus the London1_novel CoV 2012.<ref name="UKHPA"/>

===Transmission===
{{See also|Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus}}

==== Camels ====
A study performed between 2010 and 2013, in which the incidence of MERS was evaluated in 310 [[dromedary|dromedary camels]], revealed high titers of neutralizing antibodies to MERS-CoV in the blood serum of these animals.<ref name=Hemida12dec2013/> A further study sequenced MERS-CoV from nasal swabs of [[dromedary]] camels in Saudi Arabia and found they had sequences identical to previously sequenced human isolates. Some individual camels were also found to have more than one genomic variant in their [[Pharynx|nasopharynx]].<ref name=Briese29apr2014/> There is also a 2014 report of a Saudi Arabian man who became ill seven days after applying topical medicine to the noses of several sick camels and later he and one of the camels were found to have identical strains of MERS-CoV.<ref name=BBC5jun2014/><ref name=Azhar4jun2014/> It is still unclear how the virus is transmitted from camels to humans. In 2014, the Saudi Ministry of Agriculture advised people to avoid contact with camels or wear breathing masks when around them.<ref name=BBC11may2014/> In response "some people have refused to listen to the government's advice"<ref name=BBC13may2014/> and kiss their camels in defiance of their government's advice. In 2020, the World Health Organization advised avoiding contact with camels and to eat only fully cooked camel meat, pasteurized camel milk, and to avoid drinking [[camel urine]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/middle-east-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-(mers-cov)|title=Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV)|website=www.who.int|language=en|access-date=2020-04-06|archive-date=2 April 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200402002412/https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/middle-east-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-(mers-cov)|url-status=live}}</ref>

==== Between people ====
There has been evidence of limited, but not sustained spread of MERS-CoV from person to person, both in households as well as in health care settings like hospitals.<ref name=Assiri8jan2013/><ref name=HPA14mar2013/> Most transmission has occurred "in the circumstances of close contact with severely ill persons in healthcare or household settings" and there is no evidence of transmission from asymptomatic cases.<ref name=WHO8aug2013/> Cluster sizes have ranged from 1 to 26 people, with an average of 2.7.<ref name=Cauchemez13nov2013/>

==Diagnosis==
According to [[World Health Organization]], the interim case definition is that a confirmed case is identified in a person with a positive lab test by "molecular diagnostics including either a positive [[Polymerase chain reaction|PCR]] on at least two specific genomic targets or a single positive target with sequencing on a second".<ref name=WHO3jul2013/>

=== World Health Organization ===
According to the WHO, a probable case is:<ref name=WHO3jul2013/>
* A person with a fever, respiratory infection, and evidence of pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome, where testing for MERS-CoV is unavailable or negative on a single inadequate specimen, and the person has a direct link with a confirmed case
* A person with an [[acute febrile respiratory illness]] with clinical, [[Radiology|radiological]], or histopathological evidence of [[Lung parenchyma|pulmonary parenchymal]] disease (e.g., pneumonia or acute respiratory distress Syndrome), an inconclusive MERS-CoV laboratory test (that is, a positive [[screening test]] without confirmation), and a resident of or traveler to Middle Eastern countries where MERS-CoV virus is believed to be circulating in the 14 days before onset of illness
* A person with an acute febrile respiratory illness of any severity, an inconclusive MERS-CoV laboratory test (that is, a positive screening test without confirmation), and a direct epidemiologic link with a confirmed MERS-CoV case

===Centers for Disease Control===
In the United States, the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) recommend investigating any person with:<ref name=CDC9may2014/><ref name=CDC10apr2015/>
* Fever and pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (based on clinical or radiological evidence) and either:
** a history of travel from countries in or near the Arabian Peninsula within 14 days before symptom onset, or
** close contact with a symptomatic traveler who developed fever and acute respiratory illness (not necessarily pneumonia) within 14 days after traveling from countries in or near the Arabian Peninsula or
** a member of a cluster of people with severe acute respiratory illness (e.g. fever and pneumonia requiring hospitalization) of unknown cause in which MERS-CoV is being evaluated, in consultation with state and local health departments.
* Fever and symptoms of respiratory illness (not necessarily pneumonia; e.g., cough, shortness of breath) and being in a healthcare facility (as a patient, worker, or visitor) within 14 days before symptom onset in a country or territory in or near the Arabian Peninsula in which recent healthcare-associated cases of MERS have been identified.
* Fever or symptoms of respiratory illness (not necessarily pneumonia; e.g., cough, shortness of breath) and close contact with a confirmed MERS case while the case was ill.

=== Medical imaging ===
[[File:Ciu63501.jpg|thumb|Chest X-ray of a case of MERS]]
[[Chest radiograph|Chest X-ray]] findings tend to show bilateral patchy infiltrates consistent with viral pneumonitis and [[acute respiratory distress syndrome]] (ARDS). Lower lobes tend to be more involved. [[CT scan]]s show [[Interstitial space (biology)|interstitial]] infiltrates.<ref name=HPA14mar2013/>

=== Laboratory testing ===
MERS cases have been reported to have [[leucopenia|low white blood cell count]], and in particular [[lymphopenia|low lymphocytes]].<ref name=HPA14mar2013/> For PCR{{clarify|date=March 2020}} testing, the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) recommends obtaining samples from the lower respiratory tract via [[bronchoalveolar lavage]] (BAL), [[sputum]] sample or [[trachea]]l aspirate as these have the highest viral loads.<ref name=WHOsep2013/> There have also been studies utilizing upper respiratory sampling via [[nasopharyngeal swab]].<ref name=Assiri9sep2013/>

Several highly sensitive, confirmatory real-time [[RT-PCR]] assays exist for rapid identification of MERS-CoV from patient-derived samples. These assays attempt to amplify upE (targets elements upstream of the E gene),<ref name=Corman27sep2012/> [[open reading frame]] 1B (targets the ORF1b gene)<ref name=Corman27sep2012/> and open reading frame 1A (targets the ORF1a gene).<ref name=Corman6dec2012/> The WHO recommends the upE target for screening assays as it is highly sensitive.<ref name=WHOsep2013/> In addition, hemi-nested sequencing amplicons targeting RdRp (present in all [[coronavirus]]es) and nucleocapsid (N) gene<ref name=Lu1jan2014/> (specific to MERS-CoV) fragments can be generated for confirmation via sequencing. Reports of potential polymorphisms in the N gene between isolates highlight the necessity for sequence-based characterization.{{citation needed|date=November 2020}}

The WHO recommended testing algorithm is to start with an upE RT-PCR and if positive confirm with ORF 1A assay or RdRp or N gene sequence assay for confirmation. If both an upE and secondary assay are positive it is considered a confirmed case.<ref name=WHOsep2013/>

Protocols for biologically safe [[immunofluorescence]] assays (IFA) have also been developed; however, antibodies against [[coronavirus|betacoronaviruses]] are known to cross-react within the genus. This effectively limits their use to confirmatory applications.<ref name=Corman6dec2012/> A more specific protein-microarray based assay has also been developed that did not show any cross-reactivity against population samples and serum known to be positive for other betacoronaviruses.<ref name=Reusken4apr2013/> Due to the limited validation done so far with serological assays, WHO guidance is that "cases where the testing laboratory has reported positive serological test results in the absence of PCR testing or sequencing, are considered probable cases of MERS-CoV infection, if they meet the other conditions of that case definition."<ref name=WHOsep2013/>

==Prevention==
While the mechanism of spread of MERS-CoV is currently not known, based on experience with prior coronaviruses, such as SARS, the WHO currently recommends that all individuals coming into contact with MERS suspects should (in addition to standard precautions):{{citation needed|date=November 2020}}
* Wear a medical mask
* Wear eye protection (i.e. goggles or a face shield)
* Wear a clean, non sterile, long sleeved gown; and gloves (some procedures may require sterile gloves)
* Perform hand hygiene before and after contact with the person and his or her surroundings and immediately after removal of [[personal protective equipment]] (PPE)<ref name=WHO6may2013/>
For procedures which carry a risk of aerosolization, such as intubation, the WHO recommends that care providers also:{{citation needed|date=June 2022}}
* Wear a particulate respirator and, when putting on a disposable particulate respirator, always check the seal
* Wear eye protection (i.e. goggles or a face shield)
* Wear a clean, non-sterile, long-sleeved gown and gloves (some of these procedures require sterile gloves)
* Wear an impermeable apron for some procedures with expected high fluid volumes that might penetrate the gown
* Perform procedures in an adequately ventilated room; i.e. minimum of 6 to 12 air changes per hour in facilities with a mechanically ventilated room and at least 60 liters/second/patient in facilities with natural ventilation
* Limit the number of persons present in the room to the absolute minimum required for the person's care and support
* Perform hand hygiene before and after contact with the person and his or her surroundings and after [[Personal protective equipment|PPE]] removal.<ref name=WHO6may2013/>
The duration of infectivity is also unknown so it is unclear how long people must be isolated, but current recommendations are for 24 hours after resolution of symptoms. In the SARS outbreak the virus was not cultured from people after the resolution of their symptoms.<ref name=Chan2004feb/>

In May 2019, 14 cases of MERS were reported to the World Health Organisation (WHO) by Saudi authorities, of which five were fatal. All those who died had comorbidities and other relatively serious health problems ranging from only [[diabetes mellitus]] in one person (aged 35) to complicated combinations of diabetes mellitus, [[hypertension]] and [[ischemic heart disease]] in two (65 and 80 years old) and diabetes mellitus, hypertension and nephropathy in another one who was 73 years old. Another patient who died and was 64 years old, had diabetes mellitus and hypertension. All those who died were males and three of them were reported to have had contact with, and exposure to, camels. Among the nine persons who survived were two females who were believed to have had contact with a person infected with MERS, one being a 23-year-old healthcare worker. Of the total 14 cases, four were females and 10 were males. All females survived. Reports of fatal cases were from Riyadh, Jeddah, Madinah and Najran.

===Philippines===
In April 2014, MERS emerged in the [[Philippines]] with a suspected case of a home-bound Overseas Filipino Worker (OFW). Several suspected cases involving individuals who were on the same flight as the initial suspected case are being tracked but are believed to have dispersed throughout the country. Another suspected MERS-involved death in [[Sultan Kudarat]] province caused the Department of Health (DOH) to put out an alert.<ref name=GMA24apr2014a/><ref name=GMA24apr2014b/><ref name=MindaNews22apr2014/><ref name=PhilStar18sep2013/>
On 6 July 2015 the [[Department of Health|DOH]] confirmed the second case of MERS in the Philippines. A 36-year-old male foreigner from the Middle East was tested positive.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://cnnphilippines.com/news/2015/07/06/merscov-philippines-doh.html | title=DOH confirms MERS case in PH | date=6 July 2015 | access-date=8 July 2015 | archive-date=6 July 2015 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150706090646/http://cnnphilippines.com/news/2015/07/06/merscov-philippines-doh.html | url-status=live }}</ref>

The table above provides a comparison between the 2014 Saudi Arabia outbreak and the South Korean outbreak in 2015 of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Jack A |date=June 2015 |title=Why the panic?

==History==

Collaborative efforts were used in the identification of the MERS-CoV.<ref name=Lu10nov2012/> Egyptian virologist Dr. Ali Mohamed Zaki isolated and identified a previously unknown coronavirus from the lungs of a 60-year-old Saudi Arabian man with pneumonia and [[acute kidney injury]].<ref name=zaki8nov2012 /><!--ref name="thechart.blogs" /--> After routine diagnostics failed to identify the causative agent, Zaki contacted Ron Fouchier, a leading virologist at the [[Erasmus MC|Erasmus Medical Center]] (EMC) in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, for advice.<ref name=Butler15jan2013/> Fouchier sequenced the virus from a sample sent by Zaki.

Fouchier used a broad-spectrum "pan-coronavirus" [[Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction|real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction]] (RT-qPCR) method to test for distinguishing features of a number of known [[coronavirus]]es (such as OC43, 229E, NL63, and [[SARS-CoV]]), as well as for [[RNA-dependent RNA polymerase]] (RdRp), a gene conserved in all [[coronavirus]]es known to infect humans. While the screens for known [[coronavirus]]es were all negative, the RdRp screen was positive.<ref name=Lu10nov2012 />

On 15 September 2012, Dr. Zaki's findings were posted on [[ProMED-mail]],<!--ref name="promedmail.org"/--> the Program for Monitoring Emerging Diseases, a public health on-line forum.<!--ref name="thechart.blogs" /--><ref name=sciencenews27feb2013/>

The United Kingdom's [[Health Protection Agency]] (HPA) confirmed the diagnosis of severe respiratory illness associated with a new type of coronavirus in a second patient, a 49-year-old Qatari man who had recently been flown into the UK. He died from an acute, serious respiratory illness in a London hospital.<ref name=Lu10nov2012 /><ref name=UK23sept2012/> In September 2012, the UK HPA named it the [[London1 novel CoV/2012]] and produced the virus' preliminary phylogenetic tree, the genetic sequence of the virus<ref name=UKHPA/> based on the virus's [[RNA]] obtained from the Qatari case.<ref name=NPR26sep2012/><ref name=BBC24sep2012/>

On 25 September 2012, the WHO announced that it was "engaged in further characterizing the novel coronavirus" and that it had "immediately alerted all its Member States about the virus and has been leading the coordination and providing guidance to health authorities and technical health agencies".<ref name=WHO25sep2012/> The [[Erasmus Medical Center]] (EMC) in Rotterdam "tested, sequenced and identified" a sample provided to EMC virologist Ron Fouchier by Ali Mohamed Zaki in November 2012.<ref name=sampledisputeCTV23May2013/>

On 8 November 2012, in an article published in the [[New England Journal of Medicine]], Dr. Zaki and co-authors from the Erasmus Medical Center published more details, including a tentative name, Human Coronavirus-Erasmus Medical Center (HCoV-EMC), the virus's genetic makeup, and closest relatives (including SARS).<ref name=zaki8nov2012 />

In May 2013, the Coronavirus Study Group of the [[International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses]] adopted the official designation, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV),<!--ref name=deGroot /--> which was adopted by WHO to "provide uniformity and facilitate communication about the disease".<ref name=WHO16may2013/> Prior to the designation, WHO had used the non-specific designation 'Novel coronavirus 2012' or simply 'the novel coronavirus'.<ref name=WHO23nov2012/>

==Research==
When rhesus macaques were given [[Peginterferon alfa-2b|interferon-α2b]] and [[ribavirin]] and exposed to MERS, they developed less pneumonia than control animals.<ref name=Falzarano8sep2013/> Five critically ill people with MERS in Saudi Arabia with [[acute respiratory distress syndrome]] (ARDS) and on ventilators were given interferon-α2b and ribavirin but all ended up dying of the disease. The treatment was started late in their disease (a mean of 19 days after hospital admission) and they had already failed trials of steroids so it remains to be seen whether it may have benefit earlier in the course of disease.<ref name=Al-Tawfiq8jan2014/><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Spanakis N, Tsiodras S, Haagmans BL, Raj VS, Pontikis K, Koutsoukou A, Koulouris NG, Osterhaus AD, Koopmans MP, Tsakris A | title = Virological and serological analysis of a recent Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection case on a triple combination antiviral regimen | journal = International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents | volume = 44 | issue = 6 | pages = 528–32 | date = December 2014 | pmid = 25288266 | doi = 10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2014.07.026 | pmc = 7127532 | doi-access = free }}</ref> Another proposed therapy is inhibition of viral [[protease]]<ref name=Ren3apr2013/> or [[kinase]] enzymes.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kindrachuk J, Ork B, Hart BJ, Mazur S, Holbrook MR, Frieman MB, Traynor D, Johnson RF, Dyall J, Kuhn JH, Olinger GG, Hensley LE, Jahrling PB | title = Antiviral potential of ERK/MAPK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling modulation for Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection as identified by temporal kinome analysis | journal = Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy | volume = 59 | issue = 2 | pages = 1088–99 | date = February 2015 | pmid = 25487801 | pmc = 4335870 | doi = 10.1128/AAC.03659-14 }}</ref>
