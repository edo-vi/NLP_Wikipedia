'''Vaccine efficacy''' or '''vaccine effectiveness''' is the percentage reduction of disease cases in a [[Treatment group|vaccinated group]] of people compared to an [[Control group|unvaccinated group]]. For example, a [[vaccine]] efficacy or effectiveness of 80% indicates an 80% decrease in the number of disease cases among a group of vaccinated people compared to a group in which nobody was vaccinated. When a study is carried out using the most favorable, ideal or perfectly [[Controlled experiment|controlled conditions]],<ref name="NYT-20201120" /> such as those in a [[clinical trial]], the term ''vaccine efficacy'' is used.<ref name=CDC>{{Citation |title=Principles of Epidemiology in Public Health Practice |publisher=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) |edition=3rd |year=2006 |pages=3–49}}</ref> On the other hand, when a study is carried out to show how well a vaccine works when they are used in a bigger, typical population under less-than-perfectly controlled conditions, the term ''vaccine effectiveness'' is used.<ref name="NYT-20201120">{{cite news |last=Zimmer |first=Carl |author-link=Carl Zimmer |title=2 Companies Say Their Vaccines Are 95% Effective.

Vaccine efficacy was designed and calculated by Greenwood and Yule in 1915 for the [[Cholera vaccine|cholera]] and [[typhoid vaccine]]s. It is best measured using [[blind experiment|double-blind]], [[Randomized controlled trial|randomized]], clinical controlled trials, such that it is studied under "best case scenarios."<ref name="wienburg">(Weinburg, G., & Szilagyi, P. (2010). Vaccine Epidemiology: Efficacy, Effectiveness, and the Translational Research Roadmap. Journal of Infectious Diseases, 201(11), 1607-1610.)</ref>

Vaccine efficacy studies are used to measure several important and critical outcomes of interest such as disease [[attack rate]]s, [[hospitalization]]s due to the disease, [[death]]s due to the disease, asymptomatic infection, [[serious adverse event]]s due to vaccination, vaccine [[reactogenicity]], and cost effectiveness of the vaccine. Vaccine efficacy is calculated on a set [[Population study|population]] (and therefore is not a constant value when counting in other populations), and may be misappropriated to be how efficacious a vaccine is in all populations.

==Formula==
{{See also|Relative risk reduction}}
The [[outcome data]] (vaccine efficacy) generally are expressed as a proportionate reduction in disease [[attack rate]] (AR) between the unvaccinated (ARU) and vaccinated (ARV), or can be calculated from the [[relative risk]] (RR) of disease among the vaccinated group.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Weinberg|first1=Geoffrey A.|last2=Szilagyi|first2=Peter G.|date=2010-06-01|title=Vaccine Epidemiology: Efficacy, Effectiveness, and the Translational Research Roadmap|journal=The Journal of Infectious Diseases|volume=201|issue=11|pages=1607–1610|doi=10.1086/652404|pmid=20402594|issn=0022-1899|doi-access=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Clemens|first1=J.|last2=Brenner|first2=R.|last3=Rao|first3=M.|last4=Tafari|first4=N.|last5=Lowe|first5=C.|date=1996-02-07|title=Evaluating new vaccines for developing countries.

The basic [[formula]]<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Orenstein WA, Bernier RH, Dondero TJ, Hinman AR, Marks JS, Bart KJ, Sirotkin B |title=Field evaluation of vaccine efficacy |journal=Bull. World Health Organ. |volume=63 |issue=6 |pages=1055–1068 |date=1985 |pmid=3879673 |pmc=2536484 }}</ref> is written as:<math display="block">VE = \frac{ARU - ARV}{ARU} \times 100\%,</math>with
* <math display="inline">VE</math> = Vaccine efficacy,
* <math>ARU</math> = Attack rate of unvaccinated people,
* <math>ARV</math> = Attack rate of vaccinated people.

An alternative, equivalent formulation of vaccine efficacy is: <math display="block">VE = (1 - RR) \times 100\%,</math>where <math>RR</math> is the [[Risk ratio|relative risk]] of developing the disease for vaccinated people compared to unvaccinated people.

The design of [[Phases of clinical research|clinical trials]] ensures that [[Approved drug|regulatory approval]] is issued only for effective vaccines. However, during research, it is possible that an [[Medical intervention|intervention]] actually ''increases'' the risk of participants, for example, in the [[STEP Study|STEP]] and Phambili studies, which were both intended to test an experimental [[HIV vaccine]] .<ref>{{Cite journal |vauthors=Fauci AS, Marovich MA, Dieffenbach CW, Hunter E, Buchbinder SP |date=2014-04-04 |title=Immune Activation with HIV Vaccines: Implications of the Adenovirus Vector Experience |journal=Science |volume=344 |issue=6179 |pages=49–51 |doi=10.1126/science.1250672 |issn=0036-8075 |pmc=4414116 |pmid=24700849}}</ref> In these cases, the formula would yield a negative efficacy value because <math>ARV > ARU</math>. A negative efficacy value is sometimes present in the lower limit of a [[confidence interval]] of an estimate of vaccine efficacy for specific [[clinical endpoint]]s. While this means that the intervention may actually have a negative effect, it could also be simply due to small [[Sample size determination|sample]] size or sample variability.

==Relative risk==

First, the baseline risk can be calculated for each group and then vaccine efficacy ([[relative risk reduction|RRR]])  as follows:
* <math display=“inline”>{24\over 12221}=0.196 \%</math> for the vaccinated group (24 infections)
* <math>{106\over 12198}=0.86 \%</math> for the placebo group (106 infections)
* The [[relative risk]], <math>RR={0.196 \over 0.86} \approx 0.23</math>
Then, <math>VE=(1-RR) \times 100 \implies (1-0.23) \times 100 \approx 77\%</math>

Also, the [[absolute risk reduction]] (ARR) for any vaccine can simply be obtained from calculating the difference of risks between the groups  i.e. 0.86%–0.196% which renders a value of about 0.66% for the above example.

==Testing==
Vaccine efficacy differs from vaccine effectiveness in the same way that an {{Clarify|text=[[Randomized controlled trial#By hypothesis (superiority vs. noninferiority vs. equivalence)|explanatory clinical trial differs from an intention-to-treat trial]]|date=June 2020|reason=The link given doesn't explain further how vaccine efficacy differs from vaccine effectiveness, or how "explanatory clinical trial" differs from "intention-to-treat trial".

Standardized statements of efficacy may be [[parametrically]] expanded to include multiple categories of efficacy in a [[Table (information)|table]] format. While conventional efficacy/effectiveness data typically shows the ability to prevent a symptomatic infection, this expanded approach could include prevention of outcomes categorized to include symptom class, viral damage minor/serious, hospital admission, ICU admission, death, various viral shedding levels, etc. Capturing effectiveness at preventing each of these "outcome categories" is typically part of any study and could be provided in a table with clear definitions instead of being inconsistently presented in study discussion as is typically done in past practice.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Hodgson |first=Susanne H. |last2=Mansatta |first2=Kushal |last3=Mallett |first3=Garry |last4=Harris |first4=Victoria |last5=Emary |first5=Katherine R.

==Cases studied==
''[[The New England Journal of Medicine]]'' did a study on the efficacy of a vaccine for the [[influenza A virus]]. A total of 1,952 subjects were enrolled and received study vaccines in the fall of 2007. Influenza activity occurred from January through April 2008, with the circulation of influenza types:
* A ([[Influenza A virus subtype H3N2|H3N2]]) (about 90%)
* [[Influenza B|B]] (about 9%)

Absolute efficacy against both types of influenza, as measured by isolating the [[Viral culture|virus in culture]], identifying it on real-time [[polymerase chain reaction|polymerase-chain-reaction]] [[assay]], or both, was 68% (95% [[confidence interval]] [CI], 46 to 81) for the [[inactivated vaccine]] and 36% (95% CI, 0 to 59) for the [[live attenuated vaccine]]. In terms of relative efficacy, there was a 50% (95% CI, 20 to 69) reduction in laboratory-confirmed influenza among subjects who received inactivated vaccine as compared with those given live attenuated vaccine. Subjects were healthy adults. The efficacy against the influenza A virus was 72% and for the inactivated was 29% with a relative efficacy of 60%.<ref>{{harvp | Crislip |2009 }} cited {{cite journal|last1=Monto|first1=Arnold S.|last2=Ohmit|first2=Suzanne E.|last3=Petrie|first3=Joshua G.|last4=Johnson|first4=Emileigh|last5=Truscon|first5=Rachel|last6=Teich|first6=Esther|last7=Rotthoff|first7=Judy|last8=Boulton|first8=Matthew|last9=Victor|first9=John C.|title=Comparative Efficacy of Inactivated and Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccines|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|volume=361|issue=13|year=2009|pages=1260–1267|issn=0028-4793|doi=10.1056/NEJMoa0808652|pmid=19776407|s2cid=205090564 |doi-access=free}}</ref> The [[influenza vaccine]] is not 100% efficacious in preventing disease, but it is close to 100% safe, and much safer than the disease.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Gidengil |first=Courtney |last2=Goetz |first2=Matthew Bidwell |last3=Newberry |first3=Sydne |last4=Maglione |first4=Margaret |last5=Hall |first5=Owen |last6=Larkin |first6=Jody |last7=Motala |first7=Aneesa |last8=Hempel |first8=Susanne |date=2021-06-23 |title=Safety of vaccines used for routine immunization in the United States: An updated systematic review and meta-analysis |url=https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34049735 |journal=Vaccine |volume=39 |issue=28 |pages=3696–3716 |doi=10.1016/j.vaccine.2021.03.079 |issn=1873-2518 |pmid=34049735}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | last1 = Crislip | first1 = M | date = 2009-10-09 | title = Flu Vaccine Efficacy | url = http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/flu-vaccine-efficacy | publisher = [[Science-Based Medicine]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20200601042917/https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/flu-vaccine-efficacy/ | archive-date = 2020-06-01 | url-status = live }}</ref>

Since 2004, clinical trials testing the efficacy of the influenza vaccine have been slowly coming in: 2,058 people were vaccinated in October and November 2005. Influenza activity was prolonged but of low intensity; type A (H3N2) was the virus that was generally spreading around the population, which was very like the vaccine itself. The efficacy of the inactivated vaccine was 16% (95% confidence interval [CI], -171% to 70%) for the virus identification end point (virus isolation in cell culture or identification through polymerase chain reaction) and 54% (95% CI, 4%–77%) for the primary end point (virus isolation or increase in [[Serum (blood)|serum]] [[antibody titer]]). The absolute efficacies of the live attenuated vaccine for these end points were 8% (95% CI, -194% to 67%) and 43% (95% CI, -15% to 71%).<ref>{{harvp | Crislip |2009 }} cited {{cite journal|last1=Ohmit|first1=Suzanne E.|last2=Victor|first2=John C.|last3=Teich|first3=Esther R.|last4=Truscon|first4=Rachel K.|last5=Rotthoff|first5=Judy R.|last6=Newton|first6=Duane W.|last7=Campbell|first7=Sarah A.|last8=Boulton|first8=Matthew L.|last9=Monto|first9=Arnold S.|title=Prevention of Symptomatic Seasonal Influenza in 2005–2006 by Inactivated and Live Attenuated Vaccines|journal=The Journal of Infectious Diseases|volume=198|issue=3|year=2008|pages=312–317|issn=0022-1899|doi=10.1086/589885|pmid=18522501|pmc=2613648}}</ref>

<!--The information in the previous sections don't obviously point to this conclusion, at least for the non-technical readers. So, providing references for the statements below would probably make them more reliable/believable, or maybe explaining how the info in the previous sections leads directly to this is enough.-->With [[Serology|serologic]] [[Clinical endpoint|end points]] included, efficacy was demonstrated for the inactivated vaccine in a year with low influenza attack rates. [[Influenza vaccine]]s are effective in reducing cases of influenza, especially when the content predicts accurately circulating types and circulation is high. However, they are less effective in reducing cases of influenza-like illness and have a modest impact on working days lost. There is insufficient evidence to assess their impact on complications.
