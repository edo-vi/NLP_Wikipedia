'''St. Anselm's art''' is an archaic [[superstition]], in which wounds are said to be cured by barely touching the [[linen]] wherein those wounds had been covered.

[[Martin Delrio]], in his ''[[Disquisitiones Magicae]]'', observed that some Italian soldiers who practiced this art attributed its invention to [[St. Anselm]]; but assured the reader that it was invented by [[Anselm de Parma]], a celebrated [[astrologer]] and [[Magician (paranormal)|magician]].
