In  [[geology]] and [[archaeology]], '''dark earth''' is a [[substratum (geology)|substratum]], up to 1 meter (3.1 feet) thick, that indicates settlement over long periods of time. The material is high in organic matter, including charcoal, which gives it its characteristic dark colour; it may also contain fragments of pottery, tile, animal bone and other artefacts. It is interpreted as soil enriched with the sooty remains of thatched roofs from houses without chimneys, with other waste materials. In some areas it appears to give the soil added fertility.

There is no chimney on this house and the thatch becomes impregnated with soot. When the roof is replaced, the waste thatch can add fertility to the soil, resulting in dark earth.]]

London's dark earth was originally called 'black earth' by archaeologists. It was renamed 'dark earth' because of confusion with the ''[[chernozem]]'' (black earth soils in [[Russia]]), whose dark colour is traditionally (not universally)<ref>{{citation|title=The contentious nature of soil organic matter | first1 = J. | last1 = Lehmann |last2 = Kleber | first2 = M. | journal = Nature | volume = 528 | issue = 7580 | date = 2015-12-03 | doi = 10.1038/nature16069 | pmid=26595271 | pages=60–8| bibcode=2015Natur.528...60L | s2cid = 205246638 }}</ref><ref name=eckm07>{{citation |first1=Eileen |last1=Eckmeier |first2=Renate |last2=Gerlach |first3=Ernst |last3=Gehrt |first4=Michael W.I. |last4=Schmidt |title=Pedogenesis of Chernozems in Central Europe — A review |journal=Geoderma |volume=139 |issue=3–4 |year=2007 |pages=288–299 |doi=10.1016/j.geoderma.2007.01.009 |url=http://www.geo.unizh.ch/~mschmidt/downloads/Eckmeier_Geoderma_2007.pdf |bibcode=2007Geode.139..288E |access-date=2016-02-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160308210844/http://www.geo.unizh.ch/~mschmidt/downloads/Eckmeier_Geoderma_2007.pdf |archive-date=2016-03-08 |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{citation|last1=Schmidt |first1=M.W.I. |last2=Skjemstad |first2=J.O. |last3=Jäger |first3=C. |year=2002 |title=Carbon isotope geochemistry and nanomorphology of soil black carbon: Black chernozemic soils in central Europe originate from ancient biomass burning |journal=Global Biogeochemical Cycles |volume=16 |issue=4 |doi=10.1029/2002GB001939 |quote=These data challenge the common paradigm that chernozems are zonal soils with climate, parent material and bioturbation dominating soil formation, and introduce fire as a novel, important factor in the formation of these soils |bibcode=2002GBioC..16.1123S |pages=70–1–70–8|s2cid=56045817 }}</ref><ref>{{citation|last=Eckmeier|first=E.|title=Detecting prehistoric fire-based farming using biogeochemical markers|year=2007|publisher=University of Zurich, Faculty of Science.|doi=10.5167/uzh-3752|quote=It is now an open question as to whether Neolithic settlers did indeed prefer to grow crops where Chernozems occurred or if Neolithic burning formed the chernozemic soils. |url=http://www.zora.uzh.ch/3752|type=Dissertation }}</ref> thought to come from [[humus]], rather than [[soot]].

==Charred material as agricultural improver==
In the [[Hebrides]], it was customary to remove the thatch from the [[Blackhouse|"black houses"]] every spring, and spread it on the fields as fertilizer, improved by the soot which it retained. On [[Achill Island]], special smoke huts were built in the fields, stone structures with sod roofs. From October to May smoky fires burned inside them, and in spring the sods were spread on the fields.<ref>The book of masonry stoves. David Lyle. Brick House Publishing Co, Inc. Andover, Massachusetts, 1984. {{ISBN|0-931790-57-3}} (paperback edition) p.23</ref> In the Amazon basin, there are very extensive areas of dark soil, known as [[terra preta]], enriched by small particles of soot, and these areas are much more fertile than the natural soil.

== Major areas ==

=== Roman Britain ===

In [[England]], dark earth covers many areas that were built up in the Roman period, especially [[Londinium]]. In some cases, it may represent open spaces on the edge of urban centres, but can also be found in more rural settings in and around foci of settlement. In the example of London, deposits underlying the ancient city's dark earth are often dated to between the 2nd to 5th century, the middle and later Roman period. Overlying deposits are frequently dated to the 9th century when Saxon London was repopulated and began to expand. The dark earth shows little evidence of any depositional structure or 'horizons', although [[Fill (archaeology)#Tip lines|tip lines]] are sometimes recorded.

Archaeologists have debated what London's dark earth layer may indicate about human use of the city.[https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/antiquity/article/abs/future-for-dark-earth/98B789261090F933CE176B4BF4F971E5] It has been taken as evidence of refuse disposal or gardening ''during'' the Roman period on the site of previous buildings. In this case it might be evidence of a decline of [[Londinium]]'s population, or of its partial displacement outside the city walls. However, late Roman cemeteries around London do not show a population decline compared with earlier London.

Alternatively, dark earth might have formed only ''after'' abandonment at the end of the Roman period. In this interpretation, dark earth would consist of urban deposits of smoke-impregnated thatch, decayed weeds, timber, and earth floors, reworked and homogenized by worm action,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.webmesh.co.uk/darwinworms3.htm|title=Charles Darwin and his brilliant book on Earth worms chapter-3|website=www.webmesh.co.uk}}</ref> or by agricultural activities, such as ploughing, that mixed building materials from the abandoned Roman cities with material deposited later.

Latest findings in France demonstrated that dark earth may originate from a change from stone to organic building materials; timber and straw will decay and build dark earth.<ref>https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/antiquity/article/abs/future-for-dark-earth/98B789261090F933CE176B4BF4F971E5 switch in building technology</ref><ref>Macphail, R., Galinié, H., & Verhaeghe, F.

=== Sweden ===
In [[Sweden]], dark earth covering {{convert|40|hectare|acre|-1}} has been found in [[Uppåkra]], in [[Scania]], southern Sweden, where a city-like settlement existed from about the year 1 until 1000 C.E. when the settlement shifted to modern day [[Lund]]. Dark earth over {{convert|7|hectare|acre|0}} has been found in the Viking city of [[Birka|Björkö]] (today called Birka), in central Sweden, close to modern [[Stockholm]]. Dark earth has also been found in [[Köpingsvik]], on the island of [[Öland]] close to the southern Sweden east coast.

=== West Africa ===
Dark earths occur around ruins in the [[Upper Guinean forests]] of [[Ghana]], [[Guinea]], [[Liberia]] and [[Sierra Leone]].<ref name="god">{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/s10745-014-9686-0 |title=God Made the Soil, but We Made It Fertile: Gender, Knowledge, and Practice in the Formation and Use of African Dark Earths in Liberia and Sierra Leone |last1=Frausin |first1=Victoria |last2=Fraser |first2=James Angus |last3=Morrison |first3=Woulay Narmah |last4=Thomas |first4=K.

===Amazonian dark earths===
{{main|Terra preta}}

Amazonian Dark Earths (ADEs) or terra preta do índio (in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], means "black soil of the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indian]]") are a type of very dark, fertile artificial ([[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]]) [[soil]] occurring in the [[Amazon Basin]]. ADEs owe their characteristic black color to their weathered [[charcoal]] content.
