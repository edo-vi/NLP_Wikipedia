'''Biosemiotics''' (from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] βίος ''bios'', "life" and σημειωτικός ''sēmeiōtikos'', "observant of signs") is a field of [[semiotics]] and [[biology]] that studies the prelinguistic meaning-making, biological [[interpretation (logic)|interpretation]] processes, production of [[Sign (semiotics)|signs]] and [[Code (semiotics)|code]]s and [[communication]] processes in the biological realm.<ref name="DF">Favareau, Donald (ed.) 2010. ''Essential Readings in Biosemiotics: Anthology and Commentary''. (Biosemiotics 3.) Berlin: Springer.</ref>

Biosemiotics integrates the findings of biology and semiotics and proposes a [[paradigm shift|paradigmatic shift]] in the scientific view of [[life]], in which [[semiosis]] (sign process, including [[Meaning (semiotics)|meaning]] and interpretation) is one of its immanent and intrinsic features.<ref>{{cite journal

==Definition==
Biosemiotics is ''biology interpreted as a sign systems study'', or, to elaborate, a study of 
* [[Sign (semiotics)|signification]], [[communication]] and [[habituation|habit]] formation of [[life|living]] processes 
* [[semiosis]] (creating and changing sign relations) in living nature
* the biological basis of all signs and sign interpretation

==Main branches==
According to the basic types of semiosis under study, biosemiotics can be   divided into 
*vegetative semiotics (also ''endosemiotics'', or [[phytosemiotics]]),<ref>Witzany, G. 2006. Plant Communication from Biosemiotic Perspective. 
Plant Signaling & Behavior 1(4): 169-178.</ref> the study of semiosis at the cellular and molecular level (including the translation processes related to genome and the organic form or phenotype);<ref>Kull, Kalevi 2000. [https://www.academia.edu/3520416/An_introduction_to_phytosemiotics_Semiotic_botany_and_vegetative_sign_systems An introduction to phytosemiotics: Semiotic botany and vegetative sign systems.] ''Sign Systems Studies'' 28: 326–350.</ref> vegetative semiosis occurs in all organisms at their cellular and tissue level; vegetative semiotics includes prokaryote semiotics, sign-mediated interactions in bacteria communities such as [[quorum sensing]] and quorum quenching.
*[[zoosemiotics]] or animal semiotics,<ref>[[Timo Maran|Maran, Timo]]; [[Dario Martinelli|Martinelli, Dario]]; [[Aleksei Turovski|Turovski, Aleksei]] (eds.), 2011. ''Readings in Zoosemiotics.'' ([[Semiotics, Communication and Cognition]] 8.). Berlin: De Gruyter Mouton.</ref> or the study of animal forms of knowing;<ref>[[Kalevi Kull|Kull, Kalevi]] 2014. [https://www.academia.edu/6116777/Zoosemiotics_is_the_study_of_animal_forms_of_knowing Zoosemiotics is the study of animal forms of knowing]. ''Semiotica'' 198: 47–60.</ref> animal semiosis occurs in the organisms with [[neuromuscular]] system, also includes [[anthroposemiotics]], the study of semiotic behavior in humans.

According to the dominant aspect of semiosis under study, the following labels have been used: biopragmatics, biosemantics, and biosyntactics.

==History==
Apart from [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] (1839–1914) and [[Charles W. Morris]] (1903–1979), early pioneers of biosemiotics were [[Jakob von Uexküll]] (1864–1944), [[Heini Hediger]] (1908–1992), [[Giorgio Prodi]] (1928–1987), [[Marcel Florkin]] (1900–1979) and [[Friedrich S. Rothschild]] (1899–1995); the founding fathers of the contemporary interdiscipline were [[Thomas Sebeok]] (1920–2001) and [[Thure von Uexküll]] (1908–2004).<ref>Favareau, D. (ed.) (2010). [https://www.springer.com/life+sciences/book/978-1-4020-9649-5 Essential Readings in Biosemiotics: Anthology and Commentary.] Berlin: Springer.</ref>

In the 1980s a circle of mathematicians active in Theoretical Biology, [[René Thom]] ([[Institut des Hautes Etudes Scientifiques]]), Yannick Kergosien ([[Dalhousie University]] and [[Institut des Hautes Etudes Scientifiques]]), and [[Robert Rosen (theoretical biologist)|Robert Rosen]] ([[Dalhousie University]], also a former member of the Buffalo group with [[Howard H. Pattee]]), explored the relations between Semiotics and Biology using such headings as "Nature Semiotics",<ref>Kergosien, Y. (1985) Sémiotique de la Nature, IVe séminaire de l'Ecole d'automne de Biologie Théorique (Solignac, juin 1984), G. BENCHETRIT éd., C.N.R.S.</ref><ref>Kergosien, Y.

The contemporary period (as initiated by [[Copenhagen-Tartu school]])<ref>See an account of recent history in: Petrilli, Susan (2011). ''Expression and Interpretation in Language''. Transaction Publishers, pp. 85–92.</ref> include biologists [[Jesper Hoffmeyer]], [[Kalevi Kull]], [[Claus Emmeche]], [[Terrence Deacon]], semioticians [[Martin Krampen]], Paul Cobley, philosophers Donald Favareau, [[John Deely]], John Collier and complex systems scientists [[Howard H. Pattee]], [[Michael Conrad (biologist)|Michael Conrad]], [[Luis M. Rocha]],  [[Cliff Joslyn]] and [[Léon Croizat|León Croizat]].

In 2001, an annual international conference for biosemiotic research known as the ''Gatherings in Biosemiotics''<ref>Rattasepp, Silver; Bennett, Tyler (eds.) 2012. [https://www.academia.edu/19524232/Tartu_Semiotics_Library_11_Gatherings_in_Biosemiotics ''Gatherings in Biosemiotics'']. (Tartu Semiotics Library 11.) Tartu: University of Tartu Press.</ref> was inaugurated, and has taken place every year since.

In 2004, a group of biosemioticians – [[Marcello Barbieri]], [[Claus Emmeche]], [[Jesper Hoffmeyer]], [[Kalevi Kull]], and Anton Markos – decided to establish an international journal of biosemiotics. Under their editorship, the ''Journal of Biosemiotics'' was launched by [[Nova Science Publishers]] in 2005 (two issues published), and with the same five editors ''[[Biosemiotics (journal)|Biosemiotics]]'' was launched by [[Springer Science|Springer]] in 2008. The book series ''Biosemiotics'' (Springer), edited by Claus Emmeche, Donald Favareau, Kalevi Kull, and Alexei Sharov, began in 2007 and has since published 23 volumes. 

The [[International Society for Biosemiotic Studies]] was established in 2005 by Donald Favareau and the five editors listed above.<ref>Favareau, Donald 2005. Founding a world biosemiotics institution: The International Society for Biosemiotic Studies. ''[[Sign Systems Studies]]'' 33(2): 481–485.</ref> A collective programmatic paper on the basic theses of biosemiotics appeared in 2009.<ref>[[Kalevi Kull|Kull, Kalevi]]; [[Terrence Deacon|Deacon, Terrence]]; [[Claus Emmeche|Emmeche, Claus]]; [[Jesper Hoffmeyer|Hoffmeyer, Jesper]]; Stjernfelt, Frederik 2009. [http://www.zbi.ee/~kalevi/Saka.pdf Theses on biosemiotics: Prolegomena to a theoretical biology.] ''[[Biological Theory]]'' 4(2): 167–173,</ref> and in 2010, an 800 page textbook and anthology, ''Essential Readings in Biosemiotics,'' was published, with bibliographies and commentary by Donald Favareau.<ref name="DF"/>

In 2016, Springer published ''Biosemiotic Medicine: Healing in the World of Meaning,'' edited by Farzad Goli as part of Studies in Neuroscience, Consciousness and Spirituality.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Goli |first=Farzad |url=https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-35092-9 |title=Biosemiotic Medicine: Healing in the World of Meaning |series=Studies in Neuroscience, Consciousness and Spirituality |publisher=Springer International Publishing |year=2016 |volume=5 |doi=10.1007/978-3-319-35092-9 |isbn=978-3-319-35092-9 |edition=}}</ref> 

===In the humanities===
Since the work of Jakob von Uexküll and [[Martin Heidegger]], several scholars in the humanities have engaged with or appropriated ideas from biosemiotics in their own projects; conversely, biosemioticians have critically engaged with or reformulated humanistic theories using ideas from biosemiotics and complexity theory. For instance, [[Andreas Weber (writer)|Andreas Weber]] has reformulated some of [[Hans Jonas|Hans Jonas's]] ideas using concepts from biosemiotics,<ref>{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1007/s12304-018-9345-8| issn = 1875-1350| volume = 11| issue = 3| page = 324| last1 = Tønnessen| first1 = Morten| last2 = Maran| first2 = Timo| last3 = Sharov| first3 = Alexei| title = Phenomenology and Biosemiotics| journal = Biosemiotics| date = 2018-12-01| s2cid = 54020391| doi-access = free}}</ref> and biosemiotics have been used to interpret the poetry of [[John Burnside]].<ref>{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1080/14688417.2010.10589071| issn = 1468-8417| volume = 13| issue = 1| pages = 74–94| last = Bristow| first = Tom| title = Phenomenology, History, Biosemiosis: Heideggerian and Batesonian Poetics in John Burnside's Post-Romantic Process Ecology| journal = Green Letters| accessdate = 2022-01-05| date = 2010| s2cid = 171037754| url = https://doi.org/10.1080/14688417.2010.10589071}}</ref>

In 2021, the American philosopher [[Jason Josephson Storm]] has drawn on biosemiotics and empirical research on [[animal communication]] to propose ''hylosemiotics'', a theory of ontology and communication that Storm believes could allow the humanities to move beyond the [[linguistic turn]].<ref name="Storm">{{Cite book| publisher = University of Chicago Press| isbn = 978-0-226-78665-0| last = Storm| first = Jason Ananda Josephson| title = Metamodernism: The Future of Theory| location = Chicago| page= 152| date = 2021| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=pEQ6EAAAQBAJ}}</ref>

John Deely's work also represents an engagement between humanistic and biosemiotic approaches. Deely was trained as a historian and not a biologist but discussed biosemiotics and zoosemiotics extensively in his introductory works on semiotics and clarified terms that are relevant for biosemiotics.<ref>{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1007/s12304-017-9291-x| volume = 10| pages = 2–3| last1 = Cobley| first1 = Paul| last2 = Favareau| first2 = Donald| last3 = Kull| first3 = Kalevi| title = John Deely, from the point of view of Biosemiotics| journal = Biosemiotics| date = 2017| s2cid = 41549373}}</ref> Although his idea of [[physiosemiotics]] was criticized by practicing biosemioticians, Paul Cobley, Donald Favareau, and Kalevi Kull wrote that "the debates on this conceptual point between Deely and the biosemiotics community were always civil and marked by a mutual admiration for the contributions of the other towards the advancement of our understanding of sign relations."<ref>{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1007/s12304-017-9291-x| volume = 10| pages = 3| last1 = Cobley| first1 = Paul| last2 = Favareau| first2 = Donald| last3 = Kull| first3 = Kalevi| title = John Deely, from the point of view of Biosemiotics| journal = Biosemiotics| date = 2017| s2cid = 41549373}}</ref>
