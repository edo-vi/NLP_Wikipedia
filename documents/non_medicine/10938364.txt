{{Short description|China–Korea historiography disputes}}
The '''Goguryeo controversies''' are disputes between [[China]] and [[Korea]] ([[North Korea|North]] and [[South Korea|South]]) on the history of [[Goguryeo]], an ancient kingdom (37 BC – 668 AD) located in present-day [[Northeast China]] and the Korean Peninsula. At the heart of the Goguryeo controversy is which part of history the kingdom belongs to. Korean scholars have the viewpoint that Goguryeo is part of Korean history alone.<ref name=":0" />

== Overview ==
{{more citations needed section|date=September 2022}}
In 2002, the [[Northeast Project]] conducted by the [[Chinese Academy of Social Sciences]] (CASS), claimed Goguryeo as a local [[Ethnic minorities in China|ethnic minority]] state in [[Northeast China]]. This sparked a major academic and diplomatic controversy, as Korean experts on Goguryeo history accused the Chinese government of using history for political purposes. In response, in 2004 South Korea established the Goguryeo Research Foundation (renamed the Northeast Asian History Foundation in 2006), and summoned the [[Chinese Ambassador to South Korea|Chinese ambassador]]. In 2007, the Northeast Project ended, and the study of Goguryeo history in China has dramatically declined.<ref name="Chen"/> The Chinese Academy of Social Sciences continues to hold its historical perspective on its homepage.

Various analyses of the controversy have focused on external motivations for the reevaluation of history, including Korean [[irredentism]] towards adjacent Chinese territory, the possibility of [[North Korea]]n collapse, and the challenge to China from [[Ethnic separatism|transnational separatism]]. [[Nationalist historiography]] has inflamed both sides of the debate, as [[Korean nationalism]] treats the themes of a powerful Korean Goguryeo and independence from China as central (see: [[Korean nationalist historiography]]), while [[Chinese nationalism]] stresses the inviolability of its territory and the unity of its ethnic groups. Some scholars have also criticized the projection of modern-day national identities onto ancient peoples.

==History of the dispute==

===Background===
<!-- Speculation on how nationalist historiographical frames, such as Zhonghua minzu, contributed to the development are treated in a separate section dedicated to that. This is purely for describing the facts of how the scholarship unfolded. -->
As neighboring areas, northeast China and North Korea have both laid claim to the history of ancient kingdoms that occupied the region. The interpretation of history in this region has implications for contemporary territorial sovereignty.<ref name="Chung"/> During the heyday of [[Maoism]], the Chinese government line was that the history of [[Goguryeo]] (''Gaogouli'' in Chinese) was Korean history.<ref name="Chung"/> Notable statements on Goguryeo being Korean included those by Chinese Prime Minister Zhou Enlai, who said in 1963 that Korean people have lived in the northeastern region of China since ancient times and excavated relics prove that Balhae, considered a successor state of Goguryeo, is a branch of ancient Korea. The former Chinese premier's remarks have been made public through a document entitled “Premier Zhou Enlai's Dialogue on Sino-Korean Relations.<ref>周恩来总理谈中朝关系（摘自《外事工作通报》1963年第十期）1963年6月28日，周恩来总理接见朝鲜科学院代表团时，谈中朝关系 “朝鲜民族进驻朝鲜半岛和东北大陆以来，长期生活在那里。这是发掘于辽河和松花江流域及图们江和鸭绿江流域的许多遗物和碑文等史料所证明的，在许多朝鲜文献中也遗留了那些历史痕迹。” , “镜泊湖附近留有渤海遗迹，曾是渤海的首府。在这里出土的文物也证明那里也曾是朝鲜民族的一个支派。”</ref> During this time, the Chinese position was in part motivated by its good relationship with one of its key allies, [[North Korea]].<ref name="Chen"/> Since the 1980s, government control over scholarship liberalized, and more than 500 books about Goguryeo-related topics were published since then, comprising 90% of China's research since 1949.<ref name="Chung"/><ref name="Chen"/> During this time, some scholars such as [[Tan Qixiang]] questioned the state's old interpretation of history, arguing for the study of all polities within China's territory as part of Chinese history.

Another faction of historians, led by Sun Jinji ({{lang|zh-Hans-CN|孙进己}}, ''Sūn Jìnjǐ'') and Zhang Bibo ({{lang|zh-Hans-CN|张碧波}}, ''Zhāng Bìbō''), of the Heilongjiang Academy of Sciences, criticized Tan and put forth the thesis that Goguryeo should be regarded as a regional subset of Chinese history ("local Chinese history") rather than purely Korean history. They cited the traditional view in [[Chinese historiography]] that Korea was founded by the Chinese prince [[Jizi]], as well as Goguryeo's status as a [[List of tributaries of Imperial China|tributary to ancient China]]. In 2002 these scholars, mostly from northeast China themselves, established the Northeast Project of the [[Chinese Academy of Social Sciences]] to investigate this view.<ref name="Chung"/>

The establishment of the [[Northeast Project of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences|Northeast Project]] marks the beginning of the modern Goguryeo controversy. However, the Northeast Project cannot be equated with the study of Goguryeo, because it studied more topics than Goguryeo, including the history of the [[Russian Far East]], the [[Bohai Kingdom]], economic history, and local histories in ancient China and Korea.<ref name="Chen">{{cite journal|title=Domestic Politics, National Identity, and International Conflict: the case of the Koguryo controversy|first=Dingding|last=Chen|date=February 2012|journal=Journal of Contemporary China|volume=21|issue=74|pages=227–241|doi=10.1080/10670564.2012.635928|s2cid=145079682}}{{page needed|date=September 2022}}</ref>

China states that Goguryeo was an ethnic [[Tungusic peoples|Tungusic]] state and in modern-day China, Tungusic ethnicities like Manchus, Xibe, Oroqen, and Nanai are citizens of China and viewed as part of China's multi-ethnic historical civilization. The Tungusic Yemaek founded Goguryeo and it was also populated by Tungusic Mohe people.{{citation needed|date=September 2022}}

In 2003, China applied with [[UNESCO]] to register the [[Capital Cities and Tombs of the Ancient Koguryo Kingdom]] within its territory as a [[World Heritage Site]]. In December, the South Korean government published a report denying that Goguryeo could be considered part of Chinese history, and giving directions to Korean civil society groups on how to counter Chinese claims.<ref name="Chen" /> [[Korean nationalism|Korean nationalists]] groups and the South Korean popular press in [[South Korea]] expressed outrage over the Northeast Project,<ref name="Chen" /><ref>

However, the CASS's Center for Borderland History and Geography Research is underfunded, understaffed (containing only 21 researchers), and not self-sufficient; government subsidies came in response to the extremely low salaries in CASS's history and philosophy departments, in contrast to the more lucrative fields of economics and law, and the money given does not match the high strategic value of borderland research.<ref name="Chen" /> Historically, the CASS has produced research that disagreed with or is critical of government policies.<ref name="Chen" />

In March 2004, the South Korean government established the [[Goguryeo Research Foundation]] to publish research conducive to its view of Goguryeo as part of Korean history.<ref>{{cite book|title=China's Rise: Threat Or Opportunity?|first=Hebert|last=Yee|publisher=Taylor & Francis US|year=2011|page=162}}</ref> In April, China's [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] deleted references to Korea's premodern history on its website, prompting South Korea to summon its Chinese ambassador.<ref name="Chen"/> In August 2004, China sent its Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs [[Wu Dawei]] to Seoul to defuse tensions.<ref name="Chen"/> China recognized Korea's concerns and pledged not to place the Northeast Project's conclusions in its history textbooks, and both South Korea and China expressed the desire not to see the issue damage relations.<ref>{{cite news

However, China's expressed concerns that Korean [[irredentism]] towards northeast China were not addressed by the South Korean side.<ref name="Chen" /> In September, the South Korean government declared that the 1909 [[Gando Convention|Jiandao Convention]], which ceded Korean claims to northeast Chinese territory, was invalid. In 2005, South Korea conducted joint research projects with [[North Korea]] on Goguryeo relics near [[Pyongyang]]. Meanwhile, Chinese social scientists continued to publish research articles on the ancient Northeast Asian polities, including [[Guchaoxian]] (Gija Chosun), [[Fuyu (kingdom)|Fuyu]] (Puyo), Goguryeo, and Bohai, which Koreans exclusively considered their own.<ref name="Chen" />

In 2006, South Korean president [[Roh Moo-hyun]] protested this research at the 2006 [[Asia–Europe Meeting]]. That year, his government renamed the Goguryeo Research Foundation to the [[Northeast Asian History Foundation]], expanding its mandate. In 2007, the Northeast Project concluded, but neither China nor South Korea has changed their view of Goguryeo history after the dispute. In China, the diplomatic imbroglio meant that research on Goguryeo has become taboo, and former Chinese Goguryeo researchers have diverted their time and resources to other areas.<ref name="Chen" />

==Japanese and North Korean views==
During the 19th and 20th centuries, the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese Empire]] differentiated Goguryeo from the other Three Kingdoms of Korea to claim Japanese (Wa) influence in the non-Goguryeo kingdoms of [[Baekje]] and [[Silla]] in order to justify its colonization of Korea. In order to demonstrate their theories, they moved a stone monument (棕蟬縣神祠碑), which was originally located at [[Liaodong]], into Pyongyang.<ref>{{cite book|first=순진|last=리|script-title=ko:평양일대 락랑무덤에 대한 연구(A Research about the Tombs of Nangnang around Pyongyang)|publisher=중심|location=서울|isbn=89-89524-05-9|year=2001}}</ref>{{page needed|date=September 2022}}
 
Meanwhile, North Korea has glorified Goguryeo's independent qualities as part of their [[Juche]] ("self-reliance") ideology, identifying itself with Goguryeo, while equating South Korea with [[Silla]], and the [[United States]] with the [[Tang Dynasty|Tang dynasty]]. North Korea narrates their national history to conform to Juche, by denying any indication of foreign occupation of the Korean peninsula, such as the existence of any [[Four Commanderies of Han|Chinese commanderies]] there.<ref>

==Speculative motives==
Much of the scholarship on the Goguryeo controversy has focused on China's strategic intentions towards the Koreas, and presumptively overlooked the validity of Chinese scholars' historical claims.<ref name="Chen"/>

Modern [[Chinese nationalism]], which in contrast to [[Korean ethnic nationalism|Korean nationalism]], is not based on a "pure blood line" and instead stresses unity in diversity and a [[supraethnic]] "Chinese people" or ''[[Zhonghua minzu]]''. China also has an interest in promoting stability and the territorial ''status quo'' in its border territories, in order to tackle the advanced cross-border problems of [[drug trafficking]], fundamentalist religious proselytism, ethnic separatism, and [[illegal immigration]].<ref name="Chen" />{{page needed|date=November 2022}} An interpretation which suspects aggressive Chinese motivations is inconsistent with China's own [[China's peaceful rise|"peaceful rise"]] rhetoric and with its record of peacefully settling 17 of 23 of its territorial disputes with substantial compromises.<ref name="Chen" />{{page needed|date=November 2022}}

On the other hand, some Chinese scholars perceive the [[Korean nationalism|Korean nationalistic]] sentiments of some Koreans (both North and South) as threatening to its territorial integrity. In fact, there are proponents in both the Korean liberal and conservative camps advocating for the “restoration of the lost former territories.”<ref>Kim, Hui-kyo 2004,“Chunggukuitongbuk kongjonkwa hanguk minjokjuuiui chilro ( China's Northeast Project and the Course of Korean Nationalism)”, Yoksa pip’yong (History Critics) 2004, Spring, Seoul:Yoksa bip’yongsa.</ref>{{page needed|date=November 2022}} Chinese scholars are afraid of border changes when the North Korean government collapses. Because there are more than 2 million ethnic Koreans living in China's [[Jilin]] province, China fears that they might secede from China and join a newly unified Korea.<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web|url=http://hnn.us/articles/7077.html|title=The War of Words Between South Korea and China Over An Ancient Kingdom: Why Both Sides Are Misguided – History News Network|website=hnn.us}}</ref>{{page needed|date=November 2022}}

On the whole, the Goguryeo controversy is more significant to Koreans than Chinese. Reasons for this imbalance include the fact that in modern [[Korean nationalism]], Goguryeo's history is presented as a contrast to Korean history in the 19th and 20th century, during which Korea was subjugated during [[Korea under Japanese rule]] after which it became the first major battleground during the [[Cold War]]. Another founding tenet of Korean nationalism is to establish independence from China, which it had long been subordinate to as a member of the [[Tributary system of China]]. For example, in the 20th century, Koreans switched the central figure in their founding myth from [[Jizi]], a Chinese human sage, to [[Dangun]], a god.<ref name="Chen"/>{{page needed|date=November 2022}}

Li Yangfan, a researcher of international relations studies at [[Peking University]], believes that South Korean historical sensationalism, caused by the turbulent modern history of Korea, was the driving force behind the conflict. Li views that South Korean historians push for a strong selective narrative in Korean history, and that the motive for rejecting Goguryeo's Chinese connections is to establish a narrative of a continuous Korean nation-state from [[Dangun Joseon]] to [[Goryeo]] and modern Korea. As both China and South Korea are in the process of [[nation-building]], Li believes that recognizing South Korea's changes and establishing a set of compatible historiographical views are necessary for China's relations with South Korea.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=李 |first1=扬帆 |title=身份认同：韩国对中韩历史的选择性叙述与中韩关系 |journal=国际政治研究 |date=2009 |issue=1 |pages=44–46 |url=https://www.sis.pku.edu.cn/teachers/docs/20190904102720650645.pdf}}</ref>

[[Gari Ledyard]] observed that Goguryeo is also regarded as an important part of [[Northeast China|Northeast Chinese]] (Dongbei) identity by scholars from that region, just as it is prominent in modern Korean identity. Regarding the registration of the [[Capital Cities and Tombs of the Ancient Koguryo Kingdom|Koguryo UNESCO World Heritage Site]], he suggested that there was likely considerable regional pressure on China's national government, and found it understandable that "Dongbei self-respect requires better maintenance for those Koguryo cultural properties".<ref name=autogenerated3/>

== Arguments for Goguryeo as a part of Chinese history ==
Chinese scholars are divided on the issue concerning the historical place of Goguryeo. As early as the 1940s, Jin Yufu (金毓黻), a prominent scholar in Northeast Chinese history, asserted that [[Buyeo|Fuyu]] (Buyeo) and Goguryeo were indisputable members of the [[Chinese nation]].<ref>金毓黻. 东北通史: 上编. 六卷. 五十年代出版社 (1979). p. 31. "如东北民族之在古代，则有汉族肃慎族夫余族东胡族之分...然其同为构成中华民族之一份子，则任何人不能有异议者."<br /> p. 229. "而高句骊一族，为吾中华民族成分之一部..."</ref> The following arguments largely represent research work after the 1980s by Sun Jinji, Zhang Bibo, et al., who regard Goguryeo as a Chinese state first and foremost, as well as supporters of the "One History, Two Uses" view, who consider Goguryeo to be part of both Chinese and Korean history.{{citation needed|date=September 2022}}

Other Chinese historians see Goguryeo as a part of Korean history. In many contemporary Chinese publications on China's international relations, for example, the relations between Chinese dynasties and Goguryeo are treated as foreign relations or Sino-Korean relations.<ref name="姜孟山"/>

=== Arguments regarding the history of Goguryeo ===
* Goguryeo grew out of the [[Xuantu Commandery]] of the [[Han dynasty]].<ref name=autogenerated3>{{Cite web |url=http://koreaweb.ws/pipermail/koreanstudies_koreaweb.ws/2004-January.txt.gz |title=Koguryo part of China? |access-date=2007-07-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928035949/http://koreaweb.ws/pipermail/koreanstudies_koreaweb.ws/2004-January.txt.gz |archive-date=2007-09-28 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The Goguryeo state was founded in present-day [[Huanren County]], [[Liaoning]] province, and expanded to large swathes of [[Northeast China]] through a series of conquest wars against neighboring states.<ref name="姜孟山">{{cite journal |last1=姜 |first1=孟山 |title=高句丽史的归属问题 |journal=东疆学刊 |date=1999 |volume=16 |issue=4 |pages=38–41}}</ref> 
* Goguryeo's capital was located in Northeast China from 37 BC to 427 AD, which accounted for around two thirds of Goguryeo's history. Pyongyang was Goguryeo's capital only for the last one third of its history.<ref name="姜孟山"/>
* Goguryeo was under the jurisdiction of the Xuantu Commandery for a more than a century after its establishment. The ''[[Records of Three Kingdoms]]'' recorded that during the Han dynasty, the magistrate of [[Gaogouli County]] (Goguryeo County) managed household registers of Goguryeo, and Xuantu Commandery regularly granted Goguryeo ceremonial instruments and clothing. Xuantu was moved further north in the early 2nd century, leaving Goguryeo outside its boundaries. However, the ''[[Book of Later Han]]'', the ''Records of Three Kingdoms'' and the ''[[Samguk sagi]]'' all recorded the king of Goguryeo requesting to be placed under the jurisdiction of Xuantu or Liaodong commanderies on several occasions from 111 to 169 AD.<ref name="魏存成">{{cite journal |last1=魏 |first1=存成 |title=如何处理和确定高句丽的历史定位 |journal=吉林大学社会科学学报 |date=2011 |volume=51 |issue=4 |pages=5–12}}</ref>
* Goguryeo had a long and stable tributary relationship with Imperial Chinese dynasties after the 4th century. Goguryeo kings actively sought and accepted a tributary status with Chinese dynasties. From 32 BC to 666 AD Goguryeo paid 205 tributes to the Chinese Central Plains dynasties. From 32 BC to 391 AD, Goguryeo paid only 17 tributes, but between 423 AD and 666 AD, 188 tributes were paid.<ref>See Byeon Tae-seop (변태섭) (1999). 韓國史通論 (Hanguksa tongnon) (Outline of Korean history), 4th ed.. {{ISBN|89-445-9101-6}}, p. 40. See TANAKA Toshiaki:"The Rise of Goguryeo and Xuan-Tu Shire" [[:ja:田中俊明|田中俊明]]:《高句丽的兴起和玄菟郡》</ref> Subordinance, rather than independence, was the norm in Goguryeo's relations with the Chinese Empire. Furthermore, Goguryeo rulers accepted both recognition of royal titles and assignment of government posts in central or local Chinese governments, which shows a Goguryeo self-recognition as a Chinese power, and distinguishes it from foreign tributaries such as [[Joseon]] and Vietnam.<ref name="孙进己">{{cite journal |last1=孙 |first1=进己 |date=2001 |title=当前研究高句丽归属的几个问题 |journal=东疆学刊 |volume=20–25 |issue=3}}</ref>

===Arguments regarding the succession of Goguryeo===
* The Goguryeo people originated in [[Northeast China]]. As it expanded, Goguryeo absorbed other ethnic groups in the same area. The Goguryeo were likely descended from a branch of the [[Yemaek people|Maek people]] that lived in the [[Hun River (Yalu River tributary)|Hun Jiang]] basin.

There was a 250-year-long gap between the fall of Goguryeo and the founding of Goryeo. Goryeo only controlled a small proportion of Goguryeo territory. Although many Chinese scholars from the [[Song dynasty]] onward conflated the two states, this was the result of Chinese unfamiliarity with later developments in Korean history,{{Original research?|date=October 2023}}{{Example needed|date=October 2023}} as the Song was separated from Korea by the [[Khitans]] and [[Jurchens]].

In 427 AD, Goguryeo moved its capital to Pyongyang, and its political and economic center shifted to the Korean Peninsula. Therefore, Tan divided Goguryeo history into two phases: it is considered a regional Chinese power until 427, and a foreign state after moving its capital. Jiang Mengshan suggested that Goguryeo was simultaneously part of Chinese and Korean history. He compared Goguryeo to the [[Yuan dynasty]], which is important to the history of both Mongolia and China.<ref name="张碧波"/>{{Pages needed|date=October 2023}}

Critics of Tan's view criticize that the division was not based in historical reality of the time. Zhang Bibo argues that Pyongyang, part of Han dynasty's Lelang Commandery, was within the territories of Han, Wei and Jin dynasties until its conquest by Goguryeo. Prior to the [[Han conquest of Gojoseon|Han conquest]], the region was part of [[Gija Joseon]] and [[Wiman Joseon]], which successively submitted to Zhou, Qin and Han dynasties.{{Original research inline|date=October 2023}}{{Dubious - discuss|date=October 2023}} As such, there was no change in the nature of the Goguryeo state as a local Chinese power.<ref name="张碧波">{{cite journal |last1=张 |first1=碧波 |date=2000 |title=关于历史上民族归属与疆域问题的再思考——兼评"一史两用"史观 |journal=中国边疆史地研究 |issue=2}}</ref>{{Pages needed|date=October 2023}}{{Original research?|date=October 2023}}{{Unreliable source?|date=October 2023}}

=== Arguments regarding the history of Goguryeo ===
Goguryeo is a country founded by [[Buyeo kingdom|Buyeo]] ([[Yemaek]]) people, one of the major ancestors of modern-day Koreans alongside the natives of [[Samhan]]. Both [[Goguryeo]] and [[Baekje]] were successors of Buyeo. The fact that a portion of Goguryeo people were assimilated into China does not necessarily make it Chinese, not to mention that the majority were assimilated into other [[Koreans|Koreanic]] dynasties such as [[Silla]] and [[Balhae]] at the time of its fall and afterwards.<ref>Discovered of Goguryeo (고구려의 발견), Written on South Korea historian Kim Yong-man.</ref>{{full citation needed|date=September 2022}} Additionally, significant numbers of dispersed Goguryeo people taken into Tang custody would break free and escape to these neighboring states during the Khitan rebellion of 696 led by [[Li Jinzhong]].

* Korean scholars believe that the people of the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea]] shared a common ancestor; the [[Yemaek|Yemaek tribe]], which was distinct to nearby Tungusic ([[Mohe people|Mohe]]), Mongolic ([[Xianbei]]) and Turkic ([[Göktürks]]) tribes in terms of genetics, culture and language. Goguryeo's attitudes towards the Mohe people as well as its own perception of its self-identity reveal that it held a discriminatory attitude the Mohe people and held this attitude towards all groups that were culturally and ethnically different from it. As such, Koguryŏ's self-identity was based on two different perceptions; one being the existence of a shared cultural heritage with other Yemaek tribes, for instance other states such as Old Chosŏn, Puyŏ, Paekche, Silla and Parhae.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Park |first1=Kyeong-Chul |title=History of Koguryŏ and China's Northeast Asian Project |journal=International Journal of Korean History |date=2004 |volume=6 |pages=17–19 |url=https://ijkh.khistory.org/upload/pdf/6_01.pdf}}</ref>

* Along with its other counterparts, [[Silla]] and [[Baekje]], Goguryeo was traditionally considered as one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea since ancient times and was perceived as a state considered to be one of the predecessors of the Korean nation by both Koreans during the Later Silla and Goryeo Dynasties as well as by the Chinese during the Tang Dynasty and onwards.<ref name="National">{{cite web |title=고현묘지명(高玄墓誌銘) |url=http://gsm.nricp.go.kr/_third/user/frame.jsp?View=search&No=4&ksmno=7190 |website=한국금석문 종합영상정보시스템 |publisher=National Research Institute of Cultural Heritage |access-date=10 September 2018}}</ref> Hence, the inclusion of its history in historical records such as [[Samguk sagi|Samguk Sagi]] and [[Samguk yusa|Samguk Yusa]].

* Although supporters of the concept that Goguryeo is Chinese argue that many Goguryeo peoples were deported to China (appx. 28,200-38,200 out of 690,000 post-war households by official historical records/Korean sources and 78,000 by Chinese scholar Wang Zhenping)<ref name=":1">{{Cite web |title=Gaozong of Tang Disperses Goguryeo Refugees |url=https://db.history.go.kr/item/compareViewer.do?levelId=sg_022r_0020_0500 |website=Korean History Database (한국사데이터베이스)}}</ref><ref name=":2">{{Cite web |last=Cartwright |first=Mark |title=Goguryeo |url=https://www.worldhistory.org/Goguryeo/ |access-date=2023-10-30 |website=World History Encyclopedia |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=2020-06-24 |title=Tang China in Multi-Polar Asia: A History of Diplomacy and War |url=https://uhpress.hawaii.edu/title/tang-china-in-multi-polar-asia-a-history-of-diplomacy-and-war/ |access-date=2023-10-30 |website=UH Press |language=en-US}}</ref>, this arguably enhances the case that Goguryeo is Korean rather than Chinese. Whereas the victorious Tang Dynasty had to forcefully deport tens of thousands of Goguryeo civilians to China, many surviving Goguryeo remnants outright resisted Tang China's Protectorate to Pacify the East. Most Goguryeo remnants either rebelled and formed Balhae alongside the Mohe people, or fled to Silla. It is attested multiple times in Korean and Chinese historical records that Goguryeo and Baekje remnants sided with Silla, their long-time enemy and resisted Tang China's attempts to conquer the rest of the Korean Peninsula during the [[Silla-Tang War]]. For example, the Goguryeo Pretender King [[Anseung]] who was the nephew or illegitiamte son of the last Goguryeo King, rebelled against Tang rule which failed. He fled to Silla, leading 4,000 households with him, and the Sillan King bestowed upon him titles of nobility and territory to rule as a vassal. The idea that the migrants of Goguryeo voluntarily took refuge in Silla (and were rewarded) indicated that something was very different from the way they were forcibly relocated into China by the Tang. In Silla, there were also the former territories of  Goguryeo and its residents from areas such as Kaesong, a Goguryeo Stronghold. Silla's dual, contradictory policy towards Goguryeo can arguably be explained as that of a benevolent conqueror including the defeated Baekje and Goguryeo peoples as a part of a unified Samhan identity while at the same time treating them as second-class members of Silla, similar to how in many modern states, certain regional identities are prioritized with [[Prestige Dialects]] and prestige identities while lesser regional identities are still accepted within a common identity albeit with far less recognition and respect. This explains why the Goguryeo peoples maintained a collective identity despite two centuries of Sillan rule, and also explains why Goryeo ultimately did decide to mercifully spare the last remnants of Silla at the end of the Later Three Kingdoms Period.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Lee |first1=Soon Keun |title=On the Historical Succession of Goguryeo in Northeast Asia |journal=Korea Journal |date=2005 |pages=190–194 |url=https://www.dbpia.co.kr/pdf/pdfView.do?nodeId=NODE09375791&googleIPSandBox=false&mark=0&useDate=&ipRange=false&accessgl=Y&language=ko_KR&hasTopBanner=true}}</ref>

However, it cannot be ignored that Kim Bu-sik was a member of the Gyeongju Kim clan, which were the direct descendants of the last king of Silla, Gyeongsun of Silla. Korean historians have noted that Kim extensively focuses on Silla's history during the Three Kingdoms Period, and relegates much less attention to both Goguryeo and Baekje.

*Taejo of Goryeo viewed Balhae as a state constituted by his own kind, the Goguryeo people, and referred to them as 'relatives'. According to the [[Zizhi Tongjian|Zizi Tongjian]], Taejo sent emissaries accompanied by the Later Jin monk Waluo (襪囉) to [[Shi Jingtang]] in request of a joint attack on the [[Liao dynasty|Khitans]] to rescue the [[Dae Inseon|Balhae King]] as Balhae is considered a 'relative country' of Goryeo.

*Supporting the previous argument, although Goryeo arose 250 years after the fall of Goguryeo, discrimination from the ruling Sillan people, particularly through its Bone-rank System, kept Goguryeo identity alive. The Baekje and Goguryeo refugees retained their respective collective consciousnesses and maintained a deep-seated resentment and hostility toward Silla.<ref name="Seoul National University Press"/> Beginning in the late 8th century, Later Silla was undermined by instability because of political turbulence in the capital and class rigidity in the bone-rank system, leading to the weakening of the central government and the rise of the "hojok" (호족; 豪族) regional lords.

*Xu Jing (徐兢, 1091–1153) of the [[Northern Song Dynasty]] makes it clear that Goryeo was the continuation and equivalent of Goguryeo through his texts written in the Gaoli-tujing (高麗圖經).

The ondol, a traditional heating technology, was first built and practiced by the Goguryeo people. Chinese records indicate the first ondols existing in Goguryeo. Goryeo has strong claims as the cultural successor of Goguryeo, because it was during the Goryeo dynasty that Ondol technology spread across the entire Korean Peninsula.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.korea-heating.eu/_1ondol_eng.php |title=The Korean traditional heating system "ONDOL" |website=Korea Heating}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Lim |first1=Jun-Gu |title=Rethinking the Construction Period of the Ondol Heating System at Hoeamsa Monastery Site |journal=Journal of Architectural History |date=28 February 2022 |volume=31 |issue=1 |url=https://koreascience.kr/article/JAKO202210242829029.page}}</ref> This is in strong contrast with Sillan rule over the Korean Peninsula, which lasted more than two hundred years yet did not lead to the popularization of Ondol, which did happen during Goryeo.

==Perspectives by outsiders==

[[Alexander Vovin]] believes Gorguyeo was Koreanic in origin. He pointed to Koreanic loanwords in [[Jurchen language|Jurchen]] and [[Manchu language|Manchu]], as well as [[Khitan language|Khitan]] and argued that the Goguryeo language was the ancestor of Koreanic people, and spread southwards to replace the Japonic languages of the Samhan.{{sfnp|Vovin|2013|pp=224–226, 237–238}} [[James Marshall Unger|James Unger]] has proposed a similar model on historical grounds.{{sfnp|Unger|2009|p=87}}

According to John B. Duncan of UCLA: "For the last 1,000 years, Goguryeo was an important factor in helping modern Korea find its identity. Goguryeo is part of Korean history."<ref>{{cite news |last1=Bae |first1=Young-dae |last2=Lee |first2=Min-a |title=Korea finds some allies in Goguryeo history spat |url=https://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/2004/09/16/socialAffairs/Korea-finds-some-allies-in-Goguryeo-history-spat/2470382.html |work=Korea JoongAng Daily |date=September 16, 2004}}</ref>

According to Mark Byington of Harvard University, who has followed the debate since 1993, Goguryeo "was clearly not a Chinese state in any sense, as demonstrated abundantly by China's own dynastic histories". Byington says that the Chinese position is "historically indefensible" and "historically flawed", but at the same time has valid reasons, politically (e.g. territorial concerns), and is not as "sinister" as many Koreans believe (i.e., "a prelude to an active aggression against Korea").<ref name="Byington" />

Finnish linguist [[Juha Janhunen]] believes that it was likely that a "[[Tungusic languages|Tungusic-speaking]] elite" ruled Goguryeo and Balhae, describing them as "protohistorical Manchurian states" and that part of their population was Tungusic, and that the area of southern Manchuria was the origin of [[Tungusic peoples]] and inhabited continuously by them since ancient times, and Janhunen rejected opposing theories of Goguryeo and Balhae's ethnic composition.{{sfnp|Pozzi|Janhunen|Weiers|2006|p=109}}

According to scholar [[Andrei Lankov]]: "There is no doubt that the present-day dispute represents a case of retro-projection of modern identities. The real-life Koguryoans would have been surprised or even offended to learn that, in the future, they would be perceived by Koreans as members of the same community as their bitter enemies from Silla. Describing Koguryo as Chinese or Korean is as misleading as, say, describing medieval Brittany as French or English or Irish."<ref>{{cite news|last=Lankov|first=Andrei|date=September 16, 2006|title=The legacy of long-gone states|publisher=Asia Times|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Korea/HI16Dg01.html|url-status=dead|access-date=October 20, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061019074253/http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Korea/HI16Dg01.html|archive-date=October 19, 2006}}</ref>

== Validity of claims on ancient history ==
Some scholars analyze empirical evidence through the lens of nationalism and ethnocentrism. [[Yonson Ahn]] and [[Jie-Hyun Lim]] believe that projecting modern concepts of national territory and identity onto ancient nation states is self-serving.<ref name=autogenerated4/>

Yonson says that the Chinese claims on Goguryeo history tend to be centered on territory: because Goguryeo and Balhae shared territories with modern-day China, it is therefore Chinese. Korean arguments tend to stem from ancestry, a common bloodline.<ref name=autogenerated4/> Yonson argues both philosophies contradict the exclusivity claim that many scholars try to make for either Korea or China because Goguryeo possessed territories that now are within the borders of North Korea as well as China, and descendants of Goguryeo people live in both Korea and China. She also argues that the strong distinction between "self" and "other" drives many scholars to accept only exclusive possession of history and its artifacts. Disputes over such claims are often laden with terms like "stealing."<ref name="autogenerated4" />

== Recent developments ==
The Chinese city of Ji'an has built a Goguryeo museum within walking distance of the [[Yalu River]]. One of the major Goguryeo [[stele]]s is displayed there.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/world/archives/2013/12/29/2003580055|title=FEATURE: China, Koreas in modern conflict over old kingdom – Taipei Times|website=www.taipeitimes.com|date=29 December 2013}}</ref>

Professor Joon-Young Kang at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies noted that China's interpretation of Koguryo history completely reversed South Korea's positive view on China vis-à-vis the United States. From 1992 until 2015, South Korea and China experienced a surge in positive relations, as each abandoned their traditional Cold War ally (Taiwan and North Korea) and engaged in greater economic, cultural and technological ties. This was further empowered by the two nation's mutual grievances towards Japan due to the atrocities committed by the Empire of Japan during the Second World War, which often led to them jointly filing protests alongside North Korea towards Japan on topics such as the [[Rape of Nanking]] and [[Comfort Women]]. However, according to Han-Wool Jung, vice-director of the Center for Public Opinion Analysis of the East Asia Institute, the Northeast Project annihilated China's diplomatic accomplishments in South Korea with a stroke.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Dennis |first1=Hickey |title=Dancing with the Dragon: China's Emergence in the Developing World (Challenges Facing Chinese Political Development) |date=2010 |publisher=Lexington Books}}</ref>

On the celebration of the 30th anniversary of Korea-China ties, the National Museum of China presented a chronology of Ancient Korean history which only included information about kingdoms like Baekje (18 B.C.-660 A.D.) and Silla (57 B.C.-935 A.D.) which were located on the southern and central parts of the Korean Peninsula, while omitting Goguryeo and Balhae, whose main territories belonged to the current North Korea and some parts of Manchuria, the current Chinese territory. This sparked diplomatic protests and demands of apology from the Republic of Korea, which accused the National Museum of China of tampering the chronology that Korea had initially given to China.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Lim |first1=Seung-Hye |title=Chinese national museum to remove chart that excludes Korean history |url=https://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/2022/09/15/culture/koreanHeritage/korea-national-museum-of-korea/20220915175137760.html |website=Korea JoongAng Daily|date=15 September 2022 }}</ref>
