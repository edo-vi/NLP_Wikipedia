{{Distinguish|Geoheritage (journal)}}

'''Geoheritage''' (a blend of ''geological'' and ''heritage'') is the geological aspect of [[Natural heritage|natural]] and [[Cultural heritage|cultural]] heritage. A '''geosite''' is a particular geological [[heritage asset]].
It is a heritage category comparable to other forms of natural heritage, such as [[biodiversity]].

==History of the concept==
The first reference to geoheritage as such was at a 1993 conference held in the UK, the Malvern International Conference on Geological and Landscape Conservation.<ref>Joyce E B 1994a Geological Heritage Committee. In: B J Cooper & D F Branagan (eds), Rock me hard. Rock me soft. a history of the Geological Society of Australia Inc. Published by [[Geological Society of Australia]] Inc., Sydney, NSW, 30-36</ref><ref>O'Halloran D, Green C, Harley, M Stanley M, & Knill J (eds) 1994 Geological and Landscape Conservation. Proceedings of the Malvern International Conference 1993. [[Geological Society]], London, UK</ref>

The term geological heritage was first mentioned at the First International Symposium on the Conservation of our Geological Heritage at [[Digne-les-Bains|Digne]], France in 1991.<ref>Anon 1991 First International Symposium on the Conservation of our Geological Heritage, Digne, France, 11–16 June 1991: Terra Abstracts Supplement 2 to Terra Nova Volume 3, 1991, 17</ref> The matter is further discussed in 2002 by Sharples.<ref>Sharples C 2002 Concepts and principles of geoconservation. Tasmanian Parks & Wildlife Service, Hobart</ref>

Conceptually, geoheritage derives from various writings of Busby et al. 2001<ref>Busby III A B, Conrads R, Willis P & Roots D 2001 An Australian Geographic Guide to Fossils & Rocks: Australian Geographic NSW</ref> and Hallam 1989<ref>[[Hallam, Anthony]] 1989 ''Great Geological Controversies'' (2nd Ed). Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK</ref>).

In Sharples 1995<ref>Sharples C 1995 Geoconservation in forest management - principles and procedures. Tasforests 7: 37-50</ref> the original concept of geoheritage further developed to include the protection of dynamic geological processes and geodiversity.

In Sadry 2021<ref>Sadry, B.N. (Ed.) (2021) The Geotourism Industry in the 21st Century: The Origin, Principles, and Futuristic Approach; Florida: Apple Academic Press.</ref> the concept of geoheritage have more developed to include the vertical destinations: planetary(Space)geology.

==Definition==

"Geoheritage encompasses global, national, statewide, and local features of geology, at all scales that are intrinsically important sites or culturally important sites offering information or insights into the evolution of the Earth; or into the history of science, or that can be used for research, teaching, or reference."<ref>M Brocx & V Semeniuk (Journal of the Royal Society of Western Australia, 90: 53-87, 2007)</ref>

The definition of geoheritage is based on the Regulation of the Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources of the Republic of Indonesia No.1 of 2020 concerning Guidelines for the Determination of Geological Heritage (Geoheritage) is Geological Diversity (Geodiversity) which has more value as a legacy because it is a record that has happened or is happening on earth due to its value. scientifically high, rare, unique, and beautiful, so that it can be used for research and education in the earth.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Dewi|first=Tinalah|date=22 April 2021|title=ESDM Tetapkan 20 Tempat Geoheritage di Yogyakarta|url=https://www.dewitinalah.com/2021/04/20-tempat-geoheritage-yogyakarta.html}}</ref>

==Geotourism==
{{main|Geotourism}}

"Geotourism is a knowledge -based tourism, an interdisciplinary integration of the tourism industry with conservation and interpretation of abiotic nature attributes, besides considering related cultural issues, within the geosites for the general public."<ref name="revues1">Sadry, B.N.(2009)"Fundamentals of Geotourism: with special emphasis on Iran", Samt Organization publishers,Tehran.220p.(English Summary available Online at: http://physio-geo.revues.org/4873?file=1</ref> It is seen around the world through the growth of [[geopark]]s as well as independently in many natural and urban areas where tourism’s focus is on the geological environment.

==Examples of geoheritage sites==

===Australia===
In Australia, the term geoheritage appeared initially in Bradbury (1993),<ref>Bradbury J 1993 A Preliminary Geoheritage Inventory of the Eastern Tasmania Terrane. A Report to Parks and Wildlife Service, Tasmania.</ref> and Sharples (1993).<ref>Sharples C 1993 A Methodology for the identification of significant landforms and geological sites for geoconservation purposes. Report to Forestry Commission Tasmania, Hobart, Tasmania</ref>

In Australia there are sites which have natural features (such as Fossil Hill at [[Cliefden Caves]], NSW); cultural features (such as the site of the discovery of the first limestone in inland Australia at Cliefden Caves); scenically important sites such as the [[Three Sisters (Australia)|Three Sisters]] in the [[Blue Mountains (Australia)|Blue Mountains]], of [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]]; and indigenous culturally important sites such as [[Uluru]] in the [[Northern Territory]].

===Indonesia===

The Geological Agency of the Indonesian Energy and Resources Ministry has declared nine geological sites in the province of [[Special Region of Yogyakarta|Yogyakarta]] in [[Indonesia]].<ref>'[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2014/11/03/nine-unique-geo-heritage-sites-declared.html Nine unique geo-heritage sites declared'], ''The Jakarta Post'', 3 November 2014.</ref>  These are:

In [[Sleman Regency]]:

* [[Eocene]] limestone at Gamping (just to the west of [[Yogyakarta]] city).
* [[Pillow lava]] at Berbah (south of [[Prambanan]] temple area).
* Prehistoric volcanic sediment at [[Candi Ijo]] (south of [[Prambanan]] temple area).
* [[Prambanan]] temple area (east of Yogyakarta city).

In [[Bantul Regency]]:

* Sand dunes at [[Parangtritis]] beach (south of Yogyakarta city).

In [[Kulon Progo Regency]]:
* Kiskendo cave and a former site of manganese mining (over 8,000 ha) in the Kliripan area.

In [[Gunung Kidul Regency]]:

* Nglanggerang prehistoric volcano (near Patuk, east of Yogyakarta city).
* Wediombo-Siung beach (on the south coast of Java).
* A [[bioturbation]] site on the Kali Ngalang (Ngalang river) near Ngalang village north of [[Wonosari]].

===Spain===

The Geological Society of Spain and the [[Geological and Mining Institute of Spain]] have produced a list of internationally important [[geosite]]s (sites of geological interest known as LIGS in Spanish).
This work, which began in 1999, is part of the Global Geosites project promoted by the [[International Union of Geological Sciences]] in the 1990s and subsequently supported by [[UNESCO]].<ref name="Geosites">{{Cite web |url=http://www.igme.es/patrimonio/GlobalGeosites.htm#Esp |title=El Proyecto Global Geosites en España |access-date=9 August 2016 |publisher=IGME}} {{in lang|es}}</ref> Initially, geological contexts were identified (21 such contexts were listed by 2014), and then representative sites within these themes.  The list of sites is not a closed one, and there is a mechanism for considering further nominations.

[[Teide]] volcano, [[Tenerife]], has been designated a [[World Heritage Site]] in part for its geological interest.  Some other WHSs in Spain are of geological interest, but were selected for other features.  For example, Spain has one of the two sites of the WHS [[Heritage of Mercury. Almadén and Idrija]]. However, the criteria by which Almadén was assessed by [[UNESCO]] relate to its mining heritage rather than geological interest.

===Ethiopia===
With its diversified lithology, dissected landscapes and rock churches, there is a large amount of geoheritage in Ethiopia. Among the better documented geosites there is the [[Zeyi]] [[cave]]  in [[Degua Tembien |Dogu'a Tembien]]''.<ref>[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12371-020-00446-7  The Zeyi Cave Geosite in Northern Ethiopia]</ref>
