The '''Symphony of Science''' is a music project created by [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]]-based [[electronic musician]] John D. Boswell. The project seeks to "spread scientific knowledge and philosophy through musical remixes."  Boswell uses [[pitch correction|pitch-corrected]] audio and video samples from television programs featuring popular educators and scientists. The audio and video clips are mixed into [[mashup (digital)|digital mashup]]s and scored with Boswell's original compositions. Two of Boswell's music videos, "A Glorious Dawn" and "We are All Connected", feature appearances from [[Carl Sagan]], [[Richard Feynman]], [[Neil deGrasse Tyson]], [[Bill Nye]], and [[Stephen Hawking]]. The audio and video is sampled from popular science television shows including ''[[Cosmos: A Personal Voyage|Cosmos]]'', ''[[The Universe (TV series)|The Universe]]'', ''[[The Eyes of Nye]]'', ''[[The Elegant Universe]]'', and ''[[Stephen Hawking's Universe]]''.

[[Unruly Media]], a video tracking service, first charted "A Glorious Dawn" on September 21, 2009. A month later, the video had received more than a million views and was ranked in the music category on [[YouTube]] as one of the top-rated videos of all time.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}  On November 9, 2009, [[Third Man Records]] released a [[7-inch]] single of "A Glorious Dawn" for the 75th anniversary of the birth of Carl Sagan.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Discogs |date=2022-06-10 |title=Carl Sagan - A Glorious Dawn (2009, Vinyl) - Discogs |url=https://www.discogs.com/release/2009572-Carl-Sagan-A-Glorious-Dawn |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220607000000/https://www.discogs.com/release/2009572-Carl-Sagan-A-Glorious-Dawn |archive-date=2022-06-07 |access-date=2022-06-10 |website=Discogs.com}} [https://archive.org/details/a-glorious-dawn-third-man-records-melodysheep-carl-sagan Alt URL]</ref> According to ''[https://www.discogs.com/ Discogs.com]'', there were a total of 5 different vinyl records produced, including a limited edition 8-inch single given out only at South by Southwest 2010.<ref>{{Citation |last=Third Man Records |title=A Glorious Dawn - Third Man Records - 45 RPM Vinyl 8" Record (ft.

==John D. Boswell==
Composer John Boswell had been experimenting with sampling and remixing for some time before creating his first YouTube videos. Boswell had worked with [[Auto-Tune]] in the past and thought people might be interested in hearing American astronomer Carl Sagan sing. He first saw ''Cosmos'' in 2004 and soon after bought the set of DVDs. Boswell looked through these episodes for "profound quotes" that lacked music in the background.  Once he found these quotes, Boswell Auto-Tuned Sagan's voice and picked from the best ones.  After completing what became "A Glorious Dawn", Boswell posted the video on YouTube in September 2009 and to his surprise, the video went viral within a week.<ref name="GWC">{{cite podcast |url = http://www.galacticawatercooler.com/2009/10/24/gwc-podcast-191/ |title = GWC Podcast #191 |website = Galactic Watercooler |date = 2009-10-24 |access-date = 2009-10-26 |archive-date = 2009-11-03 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20091103223859/http://www.galacticawatercooler.com/2009/10/24/gwc-podcast-191/ |url-status = live }} Interview with John Boswell.

Although neither of them collaborated, both music video projects had similar themes, incorporating popularizers of science and science education set to musical melodies and inspirational themes.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Gower |first=Reid |title=Reid Gower - YouTube |url=https://www.youtube.com/c/ReidGower/videos |access-date=2022-06-09 |website=www.youtube.com}} [https://archive.org/details/reid-gower-the-sagan-series-the-feynman-series Alt URL]</ref>

==Reviews==
Musician [[Carrie Brownstein]] found the idea behind Symphony of Science "quite beautiful and amazing in both its sincerity and aims". She also enjoyed the "hip-hop stylings" of the camera angle on Bill Nye while he is moving his hands around and expressing himself on "We Are All Connected".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/monitormix/2009/10/the_symphony_of_science.html |title=The Symphony Of Science |last=Brownstein |first=Carrie |author-link=Carrie Brownstein |date=2009-10-20 |publisher=[[National Public Radio]] |access-date=2009-10-25 |archive-date=2009-10-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091024030412/http://www.npr.org/blogs/monitormix/2009/10/the_symphony_of_science.html |url-status=live }}</ref> Writer [[Nick Sagan]], son of Carl Sagan, was impressed with "A Glorious Dawn", giving it a favorable review and stamp of approval. Sagan writes, "John Boswell over at Colorpulse Music is a mad genius, sampling both ''Cosmos'' and Stephen Hawking's ''Universe'' series into three minutes and thirty-four seconds of pure, concentrated awesomeness... Love it, love it, love it. Dad would have loved it, too."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nicksagan.blogs.com/nick_sagan_online/2009/09/a-glorious-dawn.html |title=A Glorious Dawn |last=Sagan |first=Nick |author-link=Nick Sagan |date=2009-09-25 |publisher=Nick Sagan Online |access-date=2009-10-25 |archive-date=2009-10-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091011041034/http://nicksagan.blogs.com/nick_sagan_online/2009/09/a-glorious-dawn.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

Columnist Franklin Harris argues that Boswell's videos show that science can arouse the minds of artists just as much as religion and mythology have in the past. Harris calls the videos "art for the Information Age, inspired by science".<ref name="Harris">{{Cite news |title=Gap between art, science no longer so wide |last=Harris |first=Franklin |newspaper=[[The Decatur Daily]] |date=2009-10-22 |url=http://www.timesdaily.com/article/20091022/ARTICLES/910225006/1006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091029035041/http://www.timesdaily.com/article/20091022/ARTICLES/910225006/1006 |archive-date=2009-10-29 |publisher=Tennessee Valley Printing Company|url-status=dead }}</ref>

''New Music Transmission'', a podcast who featured Symphony of Science in 2009, gave "A Glorious Dawn" positive reviews and called Symphony of Science as "A thinking man's [[Pogo (electronic musician)|Pogo]]", referring to the Australian electro artist who was featured 2 weeks before.<ref name="New Music Transmission">{{Cite news |title=Featured Artist Profile: Symphony of Science |last=Hunter |first=Stephen |work=New Music Transmission |date=2010-12-18 |url=http://www.newmusictransmission.com/featured-artists/symphony-of-science/ |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714173217/http://www.newmusictransmission.com/featured-artists/symphony-of-science/ |archive-date=2011-07-14 }}</ref>

Christopher Jion, of ''Dirgefunk Records'', has praised Symphony of Science saying, <blockquote>"When I first heard John Boswell's "A Glorious Dawn," it brought tears to my eyes, it was life-changing. The original idea was to release a compilation of space and science-themed tracks from a handful of artists I like (of course, including some Symphony Of Science tracks). But as John kept releasing new Symphony Of Science material it became very obvious that it deserved its own album, and, as it's an ongoing project, perhaps there will be more volumes to follow. This CD is a gift from me to anyone listening who has a passion for music and science. It was paid for out of my own pocket with nothing expected in return. It's free to anyone who'll appreciate its ideas and messages. Dirgefunk Records does not exist for profit Its sole existence is to release material for the enjoyment of myself and likeminded persons. So, enjoy. (April, 2012)"</blockquote>Jion released a limited edition music CD compilation<ref>{{Cite web |title=John Boswell – Symphony Of Science from DIRGEFUNK RECORDS |url=https://dirgefunkrecords.storenvy.com/products/20003654-john-boswell-symphony-of-science |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220628000000/https://dirgefunkrecords.storenvy.com/products/20003654-john-boswell-symphony-of-science |archive-date=2022-06-28 |access-date=2022-06-28 |website=Storenvy |language=en}} [https://archive.org/details/symphony-of-science-john-boswell-dirgefunk-records-2012 Alt URL]</ref> in 2012 featuring 15 Symphony of Science tracks, listed below:
