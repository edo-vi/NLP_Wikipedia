==Content==
The original [[Spanish language]] music video, with English subtitles,<ref name="star bulletin">[http://starbulletin.com/2008/02/29/features/screentime.html Honolulu Star Bulletin: "Music video on Obama has Hawaii ties"]</ref> was the creation of a volunteer network of Obama supporters known as [[United For Obama]]. The creation and release of the video was originally intended to influence Spanish-speaking voters in the [[Texas Democratic primary and caucuses, 2008|Texas democratic primary]].<ref>[http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Blogs/Screens?oid=oid:596141 Austin Chronicle: "Andres Useche Sings for 'Change'. The Obama Kind"]</ref> The video, and song, criticizes the Bush administration while presenting Obama as the candidate for change in the [[2008 United States presidential election|2008 election]]. The video features footage of Useche singing and performing on [[acoustic guitar]], intercut with images critical of Bush—images intended to exemplify some of his failed policies, such as [[Iraq War|soldiers in Iraq]] and victims of [[Hurricane Katrina]], and images in support of Obama, such as volunteers at work for his campaign, and supporters at his political rallies. Personalities who appear in the video include [[California State Senate|California State Senator]] [[Gil Cedillo]], [[Wendy Carrillo]], and actors [[Kelly Hu]], [[Ken Leung]] and [[Kal Penn]].
