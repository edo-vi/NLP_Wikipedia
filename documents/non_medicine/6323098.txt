February was a difficult month for Özil, as he struggled to reach the heights he showed in his first few months at the club. The German playmaker pulled off a brilliant piece of skill to win a penalty against Bayern Munich in the [[2013–14 UEFA Champions League knockout phase|Champions League knockout phase]], but his spot-kick was saved by [[Manuel Neuer]].
