The '''Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks footy supplements saga''' was a sports controversy which began in 2011. The [[Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks]], a professional [[rugby league]] club playing in the [[National Rugby League]] (NRL). The NRL later offered all five players a one-year ban, backdated to an effective six-month suspension, if they pleaded guilty to taking a banned substance. Sports scientist Stephen Dank provided sworn testimony about what involvement he had at Cronulla and which Staff and coaches were involved.

Dank publicly admitted to overseeing a regimen that involved the administration of two growth hormone-releasing peptides, CJC-1295 and GHRP-6. Dank has never faced criminal charges in relation to dealing in or administering the aforementioned peptides. Both substances are banned by the World Anti-Doping Code, Dank admits both were injected into Cronulla players.

==Drug Injections==
The admission is significant, both for the 12 players who pleaded guilty claiming they had no knowledge of what they were given and for five players who refused the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority’s plea deal and were waiting for their cases to be resolved.

Central figures in the Cronulla saga entered the witness box — head coach and head of the football department Shane Flanagan, head trainer and close friend of Flanagan Mark Noakes, former club doctor David Givney, physiotherapist Konrad Schultz, high-performance manager Trent Elkin and football manager Darren Mooney

The Cronulla players were introduced to Stephen Dank by Shane Flanagan, Mark Noakes and Trent Elkin and told to work with him and trust him. They were given false assurances by Dank, Flanagan and Elkin about the substances they were given and that they were permitted for use in sport.

What records were kept of players being injected? None

Dank told the court that every week he had provided Elkin with a list of all the treatments administered. “I suspect the records were there, like I left at every football club,’’ he said. Elkin said no such records were kept. Dank’s work at Cronulla was loosely managed and undocumented.

When Givney asked for details about what the players were given, he received a vague reply about amino acids and vitamins. Givney raised concern with Shane Flanagan regarding the practices of Dank however he was dismissed and eventually stood back and accepted the practices. The similarity with how Dank operated at Essendon a year later is striking.
The process had serious ramifications and adverse effects on the football club as a whole. A number of senior staff were either dismissed or resigned, matches were played at a sub-par standard as players were physically, emotionally and socially affected, and it partially played a role in the club winning the [[Australian rugby league wooden spooners|wooden spoon]] in [[2014 NRL season|2014]].<ref>[http://www.theroar.com.au/2014/09/13/mastermind-season-review-cronulla-sharks/ Mastermind season review: Cronulla Sharks], ''The Roar'', 13 September 2014</ref> Several senior club members, including senior coach [[Shane Flanagan]] and trainer Trent Elkin, received penalties and suspensions. Darren Mooney is no longer registered to be involved with the sport.

Senior staff no longer at the club due to the controversy include Damian Irvine (former chairman) who stood down on learning of the malpractice and process failings of Flanagan and his off-field team, Bruno Cullen (former CEO), Darren Mooney (former football manager), Mark Noakes (head trainer) and Trent Elkin (former club trainer), among others.<ref name="Irvine">[http://www.theaustralian.com.au/sport/nrl/sharks-chairman-damian-irvine-set-to-quit/story-fnca0von-1226596138146 Cronulla Sharks chairman Damian Irvine quits club], ''The Australian'', 13 March 2013</ref>

Shane Flanagan's suspension expired on 31 October 2014, whilst Trent Elkin is not allowed to work at another NRL club as part of his punishment.<ref name="suspension-expired"/><ref name="NRL"/><ref name="Elkin"/>

==Background==
In February 2013, the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks were implicated in the Australian Crime Commission (ACC)'s report "Organised Crime and Drugs in Sport". The club conducted its own investigation into allegations of illegal performance-enhancing substance use but also awaited findings from [[Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority]] (ASADA)'s investigation.<ref name="asada-report">[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-02-12/cowboys2c-panthers2c-raiders-step-into-the-spotlight/4513474 NRL clubs step into spotlight in doping probe], ''ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation)'', 12 February 2013</ref> This came a week after the [[Australian Football League|AFL]]'s [[Essendon Football Club]] asked ASADA to investigate concerns over the club's possible use of prohibited supplements during the [[2012 AFL season]].<ref name="essendon">{{cite web|last=Bowen|first=Nick|title=Dons in ASADA probe|url=http://www.afl.com.au/news/2013-02-05/speculation-swirls-around-dons|publisher=AFL.com.au|accessdate=14 February 2013}}</ref>

In the wake of the report by the ACC, the Sharks then launched an investigation into a brief period of their [[2011 Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks season|2011 season]], and afterward claimed that none of its players had illegally taken any performance-enhancing drugs during that season.<ref name="2011season">[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-02-13/sharks-reveal-probe-into-their-2011-season/4517204 Sharks reveal probe into their 2011 season], ''ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation)'', 13 February 2013</ref> Shane Flanagan and Darren Mooney made statements to the board of the club that Stephen Dank had no involvement or contact with players during a short period of time in 2011. The board launched an investigation to verify those statements however Flanagan and Mooney retracted them and altered their story 3 days after the investigation was launched. This led to the sacking of Mooney and suspension of Flanagan by the Board and the resignation of Chairman Damian Irvine who was let down by the two men he employed who lied to him.

In March, it was revealed that up to 14 unnamed Sharks players were interviewed by ASADA in relation to the distribution of banned substances during the aforementioned 2011 season. They were offered a voluntary six-month ban if they pleaded guilty to unknowingly being administered with a banned substance as they were told by Stephen Dank that they were being administered "vitamins and amino acids", but if found guilty they would have risked a maximum two-year ban from the sport.<ref name="asada">[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-03-06/asada-probe-pushes-sharks-into-crisis-mode/4557346 ASADA probe pushes Sharks into crisis mode], ''ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation)'', 6 March 2013</ref><ref name="players">[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-03-07/sharks-players-warned-to-come-forward/4558948 Sharks players warned to come forward], ''ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation)'', 7 March 2013</ref> Afterwards, just two days before the club's [[2013 NRL season|season]]-opening match against the [[Gold Coast Titans]], head coach [[Shane Flanagan]] was suspended indefinitely pending the investigation by ASADA.<ref name="flanno">[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-03-08/sharks-ban-flanagan2c-sack-mooney/4561680 Sharks stand down Flanagan], ''ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation)'', 8 March 2013</ref> At the same time, former [[Brisbane Broncos]] CEO Bruno Cullen was hired by the club as its interim CEO.<ref name="cullen">[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-03-08/sharks-clean-house-amid-asada-fallout/4561834 Sharks clean house amid ASADA fallout], ''ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation)'', 8 March 2013</ref>

Flanagan and Elkin both lodged their appeals to the findings in early 2014,<ref name="provisional"/> but both were dismissed and their suspensions stood.<ref name="dismissed">[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-03-05/nrl-dismisses-shane-flanagan-and-cronulla-appeals-relating-to-sh/5300612?section=sport NRL dismisses Shane Flanagan and Cronulla appeals relating to Sharks supplements scandal], ''ABC Grandstand Sport (Australian Broadcasting Corporation)'', 5 March 2014</ref> At the time, no players or other club officials were officially implicated in the findings,<ref name="initial-penalties"/> however, on 20 August 2014, several players, notably those from the club's 2011 season and five players from the current squad, were issued show cause notices offering them twelve-month bans backdating to 21 November 2013 if they admitted to taking illegal substances during the 2011 season.<ref name="showcauses"/> Without hesitation, most of these players accepted the bans, including captain [[Paul Gallen]]; for the former, it ruled him out of the upcoming [[2014 Rugby League Four Nations]] tournament at the end of the season.<ref name="bans"/>

*[[Jeremy Smith (rugby league, born 1980)|Jeremy Smith]]
*[[Luke Douglas]]
*[[Albert Kelly]]

It was later announced by the National Rugby League that each of the players implicated in the supplements scandal would be barred from receiving awards at the [[2014 Dally M Awards]] ceremony in September; in addition, captain Paul Gallen was also ruled ineligible for the [[Brad Fittler]] Medal for being the best performed [[New South Wales rugby league team|New South Wales]] player during their victorious [[2014 State of Origin series|State of Origin]] series campaign.<ref>[http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/nrl/paul-gallen-and-all-suspended-cronulla-sharks-players-banned-by-nrl-from-dally-m-awards/story-fni3gol8-1227039764391 Paul Gallen and all suspended Cronulla Sharks players banned by NRL from Dally M awards ], ''The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)'', 28 August 2014</ref>

Five players further players alleged to have been involved in the program, but who were not part of the group which admitted guilt and accepted suspensions in 2014, were issued violation notices by the NRL on 8 March 2016. These players were: [[Colin Best]], [[Paul Aiton]], [[Ben Pomeroy]], [[John Williams (rugby league, born 1985)|John Williams]] and [[Stuart Flanagan]].<ref name="forgottenfive" /> All five pleaded guilty, and were given twelve month suspensions; but, with backdating caused in part by the delays in prosecuting the case, the suspensions had already expired.<ref name="forgottenfivepenalties" />
