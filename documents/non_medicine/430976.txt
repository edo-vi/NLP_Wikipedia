[[File:Mori Uncanny Valley.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|Hypothesized emotional response of subjects is plotted against [[anthropomorphism]] of a robot, following [[Masahiro Mori (roboticist)|Masahiro Mori]]'s statements. The uncanny valley is the region of negative emotional response towards robots that seem "almost" human. Movement amplifies the emotional response.]]

In [[aesthetics]], the {{Nihongo|'''uncanny valley'''|不気味の谷|bukimi no tani|lead=yes}} is a hypothesized relation between an object's degree of resemblance to a human being and the emotional response to the object. The concept suggests that [[humanoid]] objects that imperfectly resemble actual human beings provoke [[uncanny]] or strangely familiar feelings of uneasiness and revulsion in observers. "Valley" denotes a dip in the human observer's affinity for the replica—a valence that otherwise increases with the replica's human likeness.

Examples of the phenomenon exist among [[robotics]], [[3D computer animation]]s and lifelike [[doll]]s. The rising prevalence of technologies (e.g., [[virtual reality]], [[augmented reality]], and [[Unbiased rendering|photorealistic]] computer animation) has propagated discussions and citations of the "valley"; such conversation has enhanced the construct's [[verisimilitude]]. The uncanny valley hypothesis predicts that an entity appearing almost human will risk eliciting cold, eerie feelings in viewers.

Mori's original hypothesis states that as the appearance of a robot is made more human, some observers' emotional response to the robot becomes increasingly positive and [[empathy|empathetic]], until it reaches a point beyond which the response quickly becomes strong revulsion. However, as the robot's appearance continues to become less distinguishable from a human being, the emotional response becomes positive once again and approaches human-to-human empathy levels.<ref name=mori33>

</ref> When plotted on a graph, the reactions are indicated by a deep trough (hence the "valley" part of the name) in the areas where anthropomorphism is closest to reality.

This area of repulsive response aroused by a robot with appearance and motion between a "somewhat human" and "fully human" entity is the uncanny valley. The name captures the idea that an almost human-looking robot seems overly "strange" to some human beings, produces a feeling of [[uncanniness]], and thus fails to evoke the empathic response required for productive [[human–robot interaction]].<ref name=mori33/>

==Theoretical basis==

A number of theories have been proposed to explain the cognitive mechanism underlying the phenomenon:
* ''Mate selection:'' Automatic, stimulus-driven appraisals of uncanny stimuli elicit aversion by activating an evolved [[cognitive]] mechanism for the avoidance of [[Mate choice|selecting mates]] with low [[fertility]], poor [[Endocrine system|hormonal health]], or ineffective [[immune system]]s based on visible features of the face and body that are predictive of those traits.<ref name="Rhodes, G. 2002">Rhodes, G. & [[Leslie Zebrowitz|Zebrowitz, L. A.]] (eds) (2002). Facial Attractiveness: Evolutionary, Cognitive, and Social Perspectives, Ablex Publishing.</ref>
* ''[[Mortality salience]]:'' {{citation needed span|date=June 2023|text=Viewing an "uncanny" robot elicits an innate fear of death and culturally supported defenses for coping with death's inevitability.... {{Not a typo|[P]artially}} disassembled androids...play on subconscious fears of reduction, replacement, and annihilation: (1) A mechanism with a human façade and a mechanical interior plays on our subconscious fear that we are all just soulless machines. (2) Androids in various states of mutilation, decapitation, or disassembly are reminiscent of a battlefield after a conflict and, as such, serve as a reminder of our mortality. (3) Since most androids are copies of actual people, they are [[doppelgänger]]s and may elicit a fear of being replaced, on the job, in a relationship, and so on. (4) The jerkiness of an android's movements could be unsettling because it elicits a fear of losing bodily control.}}
* ''[[Pathogen]] avoidance:'' Uncanny stimuli may activate a cognitive mechanism that originally evolved to motivate the avoidance of potential sources of pathogens by eliciting a disgust response. "The more human an organism looks, the stronger the aversion to its defects, because (1) defects indicate disease, (2) more human-looking organisms are more closely related to human beings genetically, and (3) the probability of contracting disease-causing bacteria, [[viruses]], and other [[parasite]]s increases with genetic similarity."<ref name="Rhodes, G. 2002"/> The visual anomalies of androids, robots, and other animated human characters cause reactions of alarm and revulsion, similar to corpses and visibly diseased individuals.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Roberts|first1=S.

* ''[[Sorites paradox]]es:'' Stimuli with human and nonhuman traits undermine our sense of human identity by linking qualitatively different categories, human and nonhuman, by a quantitative metric: degree of human likeness.<ref>Ramey, 2005.</ref>
* ''Violation of human norms:'' If an entity looks sufficiently nonhuman, its human characteristics are noticeable, generating empathy. However, if the entity looks almost human, it elicits our model of a human other and its detailed normative expectations. The nonhuman characteristics are noticeable, giving the human viewer a sense of strangeness. In other words, a robot stuck inside the uncanny valley is no longer judged by the standards of a robot doing a passable job at pretending to be human, but is instead judged by the standards of a human doing a terrible job at acting like a normal person. This has been linked to perceptual uncertainty and the theory of predictive coding.<ref name = "SayginSCAN">{{cite journal| last=Saygin| first=A.P.|title=The Thing That Should Not Be: Predictive Coding and the Uncanny Valley in Perceiving Human and Humanoid Robot Actions. |journal=Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience| year=2011 | volume = 7| issue=4| pages = 413–22| doi=10.1093/scan/nsr025| pmid=21515639| pmc=3324571}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ho |first1=C. |last2=MacDorman |first2=K.

* ''Conflicting perceptual cues:'' The negative effect associated with uncanny stimuli is produced by the activation of conflicting cognitive representations. Perceptual tension occurs when an individual perceives conflicting cues to [[Categorization|category]] membership, such as when a humanoid figure moves like a robot, or has other visible robot features. This cognitive conflict is experienced as psychological discomfort (i.e., "eeriness"), much like the discomfort that is experienced with [[cognitive dissonance]].<ref name="Ferrey2015">{{cite journal | last1 = Ferrey | first1 = A.

* ''Threat to humans' distinctiveness and identity:'' Negative reactions toward very humanlike robots can be related to the challenge that this kind of robot leads to the categorical human – non-human distinction. Kaplan<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kaplan|first1=F.|title=Who is afraid of the humanoid? Investigating cultural differences in the acceptance of robots.|journal=International Journal of Humanoid Robotics|year=2004|volume=1|issue=3 |pages=465–480|doi=10.1142/s0219843604000289 |citeseerx=10.1.1.78.5490}}</ref> stated that these new machines challenge human uniqueness, pushing for a redefinition of humanness.

The more a robot resembles a real person, the more it represents a challenge to our social identity as human beings.
* ''Religious definition of human identity:'' The existence of artificial but humanlike entities is viewed by some as a threat to the concept of human identity. An example can be found in the theoretical framework of psychiatrist [[Irvin Yalom]]. Yalom explains that humans construct psychological defenses to avoid existential anxiety stemming from death. One of these defenses is 'specialness', the irrational belief that aging and death as central premises of life apply to all others but oneself.<ref>Yalom, Irvin D. (1980) "Existential Psychotherapy", Basic Books, Inc., Publishers, New York</ref> The experience of the very humanlike "living" robot can be so rich and compelling that it challenges humans' notions of "specialness" and existential defenses, eliciting existential anxiety. In folklore, the creation of human-like, but soulless, beings is often shown to be unwise, as with the [[golem]] in Judaism, whose absence of human empathy and spirit can lead to disaster, however good the intentions of its creator.<ref>{{cite web |author=Cathy S.

* ''Uncanny valley of the mind or AI:'' Due to rapid advancements in the areas of [[artificial intelligence]] and [[affective computing]], cognitive scientists have also suggested the possibility of an "uncanny valley of mind".<ref>{{Cite journal|date=1 October 2012|title=Feeling robots and human zombies: Mind perception and the uncanny valley|journal=Cognition|volume=125|issue=1|pages=125–130 |doi=10.1016/j.cognition.2012.06.007|pmid=22784682 |issn=0010-0277|last1=Gray|first1=Kurt|last2=Wegner |first2=Daniel M.|s2cid=7828975}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|date=1 March 2017|title=Venturing into the uncanny valley of mind—The influence of mind attribution on the acceptance of human-like characters in a virtual reality setting|journal=Cognition|volume=160|pages=43–50 |doi=10.1016/j.cognition.2016.12.010 |pmid=28043026|issn=0010-0277|last1=Stein|first1=Jan-Philipp|last2=Ohler |first2=Peter|s2cid=2944145}}</ref> Accordingly, people might experience strong feelings of aversion if they encounter highly advanced, emotion-sensitive technology. Among the possible explanations for this phenomenon, both a perceived loss of human uniqueness and expectations of immediate physical harm are discussed by contemporary research.

===Research===
[[File:Uncanny valley.png|thumb|350px|An empirically estimated uncanny valley for static robot face images<ref name="Mathur2016"/>]]
A series of studies experimentally investigated whether uncanny valley effects exist for static images of robot faces. Mathur MB & Reichling DB<ref name="Mathur2016"/> used two complementary sets of stimuli spanning the range from very mechanical to very human-like: first, a sample of 80 objectively chosen robot face images from Internet searches, and second, a morphometrically and graphically controlled 6-face series set of faces. They asked subjects to explicitly rate the likability of each face. To measure trust toward each face, subjects completed a one-shot investment game to indirectly measure how much money they were willing to "wager" on a robot's trustworthiness. Both stimulus sets showed a robust uncanny valley effect on explicitly-rated likability and a more context-dependent uncanny valley on implicitly-rated trust. Their exploratory analysis of one proposed mechanism for the uncanny valley, perceptual confusion at a category boundary, found that category confusion occurs in the uncanny valley but does not mediate the effect on social and emotional responses.

One study conducted in 2009 examined the evolutionary mechanism behind the aversion associated with the uncanny valley. A group of five monkeys were shown three images: two different 3D&nbsp;monkey faces (realistic, unrealistic), and a real photo of a monkey's face. The monkeys' eye-gaze was used as a proxy for preference or aversion. Since the realistic 3D&nbsp;monkey face was looked at less than either the real photo, or the unrealistic 3D&nbsp;monkey face, this was interpreted as an indication that the monkey participants found the realistic 3D&nbsp;face aversive, or otherwise preferred the other two images. As one would expect with the uncanny valley, more realism can lead to less positive reactions, and this study demonstrated that neither human-specific cognitive processes, nor human culture explain the uncanny valley. In other words, this aversive reaction to realism can be said to be evolutionary in origin.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Kitta MacPherson |date=13 October 2009 |url=http://www.princeton.edu/main/news/archive/S25/53/99A37/index.xml?section=topstories |title=Monkey visual behavior falls into the uncanny valley |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=106|issue=43|pages=18362–18366|publisher=Princeton University |pmid=19822765 |pmc=2760490 |access-date=20 March 2011 |bibcode=2009PNAS..10618362S |doi=10.1073/pnas.0910063106|doi-access=free}}</ref>

==Design principles==
A number of design principles have been proposed for avoiding the uncanny valley:
* Design elements should match in human realism. A robot may look uncanny when human and nonhuman elements are mixed. For example, both a robot with a synthetic voice or a human being with a human voice have been found to be less eerie than a robot with a human voice or a human being with a synthetic voice.<ref name="Mitchell et al., 2011">Mitchell et al., 2011.</ref> For a robot to give a more positive impression, its degree of human realism in appearance should also match its degree of human realism in behavior.<ref name="Goetz, Kiesler, & Powers, 2003">Goetz, Kiesler, & Powers, 2003.</ref> If an animated character looks more human than its movement, this gives a negative impression.<ref>Vinayagamoorthy, Steed, & Slater, 2005.</ref> Human neuroimaging studies also indicate matching appearance and motion kinematics are important.<ref name="SayginSCAN" /><ref name="Saygin2010">Saygin et al., 2010.</ref><ref name="Saygin2011">Saygin et al., 2011.</ref>
* Reducing conflict and uncertainty by matching appearance, behavior, and ability. In terms of performance, if a robot looks too appliance-like, people expect little from it; if it looks too human, people expect too much from it.<ref name="Goetz, Kiesler, & Powers, 2003"/> A highly human-like appearance leads to an expectation that certain behaviors are present, such as humanlike motion dynamics. This likely operates at a sub-conscious level and may have a biological basis. Neuroscientists have noted "when the brain's expectations are not met, the brain...generates a 'prediction error'. As human-like artificial agents become more commonplace, perhaps our perceptual systems will be re-tuned to accommodate these new social partners. Or perhaps, we will decide 'it is not a good idea to make [robots] so clearly in our image after all'."<ref name="SayginSCAN" /><ref name="Saygin2011" /><ref>{{cite news|last=Gaylord|first=Chris|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/Innovation/Tech/2011/0914/Uncanny-Valley-Will-we-ever-learn-to-live-with-artificial-humans|title=Uncanny Valley: Will we ever learn to live with artificial humans?|newspaper=[[The Christian Science Monitor]]|date=14 September 2011}}</ref>
* Human facial proportions and photorealistic texture should only be used together. A photorealistic human texture demands human facial proportions, or the computer generated character can fall into the uncanny valley. Abnormal facial proportions, including those typically used by artists to enhance attractiveness (e.g.,&nbsp;larger eyes), can look eerie with a photorealistic human texture.

==Criticism==
A number of criticisms have been raised concerning whether the uncanny valley exists as a unified phenomenon amenable to scientific scrutiny:
* The uncanny valley is a [[wikt:heterogeneous|heterogeneous]] group of phenomena. Phenomena labeled as being in the uncanny valley can be diverse, involve different sense modalities, and have multiple, possibly overlapping causes. People's cultural backgrounds may have a considerable influence on how androids are perceived with respect to the uncanny valley.<ref>Bartneck Kanda, Ishiguro, & Hagita, 2007.</ref>
* The uncanny valley may be generational. Younger generations, more used to [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]], robots, and such, may be less likely to be affected by this hypothesized issue.<ref>{{cite web|first=Annalee |last=Newitz |url=http://io9.com/is-the-uncanny-valley-a-myth-1239355550 |title=Is the 'uncanny valley' a myth? |website=[[Gizmodo]] |date=3 September 2013|access-date=4 September 2013}}</ref>
* The uncanny valley is simply a specific case of [[information processing]] such as categorization and frequency-based effects. In contrast to the assumption that the uncanny valley is based on a heterogeneous group of phenomena, recent arguments have suggested that uncanny valley-like phenomena simply reflect the products of information processing such as categorization. Cheetham et al.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Cheetham | first1 = Marcus | last2 = Suter | first2 = Pascal | last3 = Jäncke | first3 = Lutz | date = 24 November 2011 | title = The human likeness dimension of the 'uncanny valley hypothesis': behavioral and functional MRI findings | journal = Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | publisher=Clarivate Analytics|location=London, England|volume = 5 | page = 126 | doi = 10.3389/fnhum.2011.00126 | pmid = 22131970 | pmc = 3223398 | doi-access = free }}</ref> have argued that the uncanny valley can be understood in terms of categorization processes, with a category boundary defining 'the valley'. Extending this argument, Burleigh and Schoenherr<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Burleigh | first1 = T. J. | last2 = Schoenherr | first2 = J. R. | year = 2014 | title = A reappraisal of the uncanny valley: categorical perception or frequency-based sensitization? | journal = Frontiers in Psychology | volume = 5 | page = 1488 | doi = 10.3389/fpsyg.2014.01488 | pmid = 25653623 | pmc = 4300869 | doi-access = free }}</ref> suggested that the effects associated with the uncanny valley can be divided into those attributable to the category boundary and individual exemplar frequency. Namely, the negative affective responses attributed to the uncanny valley were simply a result of the frequency of exposure, similar to the [[mere-exposure effect]]. By varying the frequency of training items, they were able to demonstrate a dissociation between cognitive uncertainty based on the category boundary and affective uncertainty based on the frequency of training exemplars. In a follow-up study, Schoenherr and Burleigh<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Schoenherr | first1 = J. R. | last2 = Burleigh | first2 = T. J. | year = 2020 | title = Dissociating affective and cognitive dimensions of uncertainty by altering regulatory focus | journal = Acta Psychologica | volume = 205 | page = 103017 | doi = 10.1016/j.actpsy.2020.103017| pmid = 32229317 | s2cid = 214749038 }}</ref> demonstrated that an instructional manipulation affected categorization accuracy but not ratings of negative affect. Thus, generational effects and cultural artifacts can be accounted for with basic information processing mechanisms.<ref name="Uncanny sociocultural categories"/> These and related findings have been used to argue that the uncanny valley is merely an artifact of having greater familiarity with members of human categories and does not reflect a unique phenomenon.
* The uncanny valley appears at any degree of human likeness. Hanson has also pointed out that uncanny entities may appear anywhere in a spectrum ranging from the abstract (e.g.,&nbsp;[[MIT]]'s robot Lazlo) to the perfectly human (e.g.,&nbsp;cosmetically atypical people).<ref name="Hanson, 2005"/> [[Capgras delusion]] is a relatively rare condition in which the patient believes that people (or, in some cases, things) have been replaced with duplicates. These duplicates are rationally accepted as identical in physical properties, but the irrational belief is held that the "true" entity has been replaced with something else. Some people with Capgras delusion claim that the duplicate is a robot. Ellis and Lewis argue that the delusion arises from an intact system for overt recognition coupled with a damaged system for covert recognition, which leads to conflict over an individual being identifiable but not familiar in any emotional sense.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Ellis | first1 = H. | last2 = Lewis | first2 = M. | year = 2001 | title = Capgras delusion: A window on face recognition | journal = Trends in Cognitive Sciences | volume = 5 | issue = 4| pages = 149–156 | doi=10.1016/s1364-6613(00)01620-x| pmid = 11287268 | s2cid = 14058637 }}</ref> This supports the view that the uncanny valley could arise due to issues of categorical perception that are particular to the way the brain processes information.<ref name="Saygin2011" /><ref>{{cite journal|first=Frank E.|last=Pollick|title=In Search of the Uncanny Valley. Analog communication: Evolution, brain mechanisms, dynamics, simulation|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|journal=The Vienna Series in Theoretical Biology|year=2009|url=https://www.psy.gla.ac.uk/~frank/Documents/InSearchUncannyValley_v-1.pdf}}</ref>
* Good design can lift human-looking entities out of the uncanny valley. [[David Hanson (robotics designer)|David Hanson]] has criticized Mori's hypothesis that entities approaching human appearance will necessarily be evaluated negatively.<ref name="Hanson, 2005">{{cite journal | last1 = Hanson | first1 = David | last2 = Olney | first2 = Andrew | last3 = Pereira | first3 = Ismar A. | last4 = Zielke | first4 = Marge | year = 2005 | title = Upending the Uncanny Valley | journal = Proceedings of the National Conference on Artificial Intelligence | volume = 20 | pages = 1728–1729 }}</ref> He has shown that the uncanny valley could be flattened out by adding [[Neoteny|neotenous]], cartoonish features to the entities that had formerly fallen into the valley.<ref name="Hanson, 2005"/> This approach incorporates the idea that humans find characteristics appealing when they are reminiscent of the young of our own (as well as many other) species, as used in cartoons.

==Similar effects==
If the uncanny valley is the result of general cognitive processes, there should be evidence in evolutionary history and cultural artifacts.<ref name="Uncanny sociocultural categories"/> An effect similar to the uncanny valley was noted by [[Charles Darwin]] in 1839:

{{Blockquote|The expression of this <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[Lachesis muta|Trigonocephalus]]<nowiki>]</nowiki> snake's face was hideous and fierce; the pupil consisted of a vertical slit in a mottled and coppery iris; the jaws were broad at the base, and the nose terminated in a triangular projection. I do not think I ever saw anything more ugly, excepting, perhaps, some of the [[vampire bat]]s. I imagine this repulsive aspect originates from the features being placed in positions, with respect to each other, somewhat proportional to the human face; and thus we obtain a scale of hideousness.|Charles Darwin|''[[The Voyage of the Beagle]]''<ref>Charles Darwin. ''The Voyage of the Beagle ''. New York: Modern Library. 2001. p. 87.</ref>}}

A similar "uncanny valley" effect could, according to the ethical-futurist writer Jamais Cascio, show up when humans begin modifying themselves with [[transhuman]] enhancements (cf. [[body modification]]), which aim to improve the abilities of the human body beyond what would normally be possible, be it [[eyesight]], [[muscle]] strength, or [[cognition]].<ref name=openthefuture>{{Cite web

However, according to this theory, once such technologies gain further distance from human norms, "[[transhuman]]" individuals would cease to be judged on human levels and instead be regarded as separate entities altogether (this point is what has been dubbed "[[posthuman]]"), and it is here that acceptance would rise once again out of the uncanny valley.<ref name=openthefuture /> Another example comes from "pageant retouching" photos, especially of children, which some find disturbingly doll-like.<ref>{{cite web|author=Erinhurt |url=http://viz.cwrl.utexas.edu/node/235 |title=Retouching memories? |publisher=University of Texas |date=26 February 2008 |access-date=20 March 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120226082858/http://viz.cwrl.utexas.edu/node/235 |archive-date=26 February 2012}}</ref>

==In visual effects==
A number of films that use [[computer-generated imagery]] to show characters have been described by reviewers as giving a feeling of revulsion or "creepiness" as a result of the characters looking too realistic. Examples include the following:

* According to roboticist [[Dario Floreano]], the baby character Billy in [[Pixar]]'s groundbreaking 1988 animated short film ''[[Tin Toy]]'' provoked negative audience reactions, which first led the film industry to take the concept of the uncanny valley seriously.<ref>{{cite web | author=Dario Floreano | url=http://moodle.epfl.ch/mod/resource/view.php?inpopup=true&id=41111 | title=Bio-Mimetic Robotics |author-link = Dario Floreano}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}</ref><ref>[[École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne|EPFL]]. http://moodle.epfl.ch/mod/resource/view.php?inpopup=true&id=41121{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}</ref>

* Reviewers had mixed opinions regarding whether the 2011 animated film ''[[The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn]]'' was affected by the uncanny valley. Daniel D. Snyder of ''[[The Atlantic]]'' wrote, "Instead of trying to bring to life Herge's beautiful artwork, Spielberg and co. have opted to bring the movie into the 3D era using trendy motion-capture technique to recreate Tintin and his friends. Tintin's original face, while barebones, never suffered for a lack of expression. It's now outfitted with an alien and unfamiliar visage, his plastic skin dotted with pores and subtle wrinkles." He added, "In bringing them to life, Spielberg has made the characters dead.".<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Snyder|first=Daniel D.|date=26 December 2011|title='Tintin' and the Curious Case of the Dead Eyes|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2011/12/tintin-and-the-curious-case-of-the-dead-eyes/250432/|magazine=[[The Atlantic]]|access-date=20 March 2016}}</ref> N.B. of ''[[The Economist]]'' called elements of the animation "grotesque", writing, "Tintin, Captain Haddock and the others exist in settings that are almost photo-realistic, and nearly all of their features are those of flesh-and-blood people.

===Virtual actors===
An increasingly common practice is to feature [[virtual actor]]s in films: CGI likenesses of real actors used because the original actor either looks too old for the part or is deceased. Sometimes a virtual actor is created with involvement from the original actor (who may contribute motion capture, audio, etc.), while at other times the actor has no involvement. Reviewers have often criticized the use of virtual actors for its uncanny valley effect, saying it adds an eerie feeling to the movie. Examples of virtual actors that have received such criticism include replicas of [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] in ''[[Terminator Salvation]]'' (2009)<ref>{{cite web|last=Somma|first=Ryan|date=15 October 2009|title=Will James Cameron's Avatar Escape the Uncanny Valley?|url=http://ideonexus.com/2009/10/15/will-james-camerons-avatar-escape-the-uncanny-valley/|access-date=20 March 2016|publisher=Ideonexus.com|quote=''Terminator: Salvation'' took advantage of the spooky effect, intentionally or not, with a computer animated Arnold Schwarzenegger cameo.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Wadsworth|first=Kyle|date=7 December 2009|title=Scaling the Uncanny Valley|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/blogs/members/b/shootist2600_blog/archive/2009/12/07/scaling-the-uncanny-valley.aspx|access-date=20 March 2016|publisher=[[Gameinformer.com]]|quote=This would be a welcome counterpoint to the relatively poor rendering of a virtual Arnold Schwarzenegger in Terminator Salvation.}}</ref> and ''[[Terminator Genisys]]'' (2015),<ref>{{cite news|last=Mungenast|first=Eric|date=2 July 2015|title='Terminator Genisys' more than adequate|newspaper=[[East Valley Tribune]]|url=http://www.eastvalleytribune.com/get_out/movies/article_7657c5c0-2103-11e5-b073-1fba99814591.html|access-date=20 March 2016|quote=One notable technological problem stems from the attempt to make old Schwarzenegger look young again with some digital manipulation — it definitely doesn't cross over the uncanny valley.}}</ref> [[Jeff Bridges]] in ''[[Tron: Legacy]]'' (2010),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/tron-legacy-reviews-vic-92655/|title='TRON: Legacy' Review – Screen Rant|last=Holtreman|first=Vic|date=16 December 2010|publisher=Screenrant.com|access-date=20 March 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Dargis|first=Manohla|author-link=Manohla Dargis|date=16 December 2010|title=Following in Father's Parallel-Universe Footsteps|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/17/movies/17tron.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=20 March 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Biancolli|first=Amy|date=16 December 2010|title=TRON: Legacy |url=http://www.chron.com/entertainment/movies/article/TRON-Legacy-1712822.php|newspaper=[[Houston Chronicle]]|access-date=20 March 2016}}</ref> [[Peter Cushing]] and [[Carrie Fisher]] in ''[[Rogue One]]'' (2016),<ref>{{cite news |last=McMillan |first=Graeme |date=18 December 2016|work=The Hollywood Reporter|title='Rogue One': That Familiar Face Isn't Familiar Enough|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/rogue-one-grand-moff-tarkins-familiar-face-isnt-familiar-957178|access-date=19 December 2016 |quote=The Tarkin that appears in Rogue One is a mix of CGI and live-action, and it... doesn't work. — In fact, for a special effect that's still stuck in the depths of the uncanny valley, it's surprising just how much of the movie Tarkin appears in, quietly undermining every scene he's in by somehow seeming less real than the various inhuman aliens in the movie.}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Lawler|first=Kelly|date=19 December 2016|title=How the 'Rogue One' ending went wrong|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/entertainthis/2016/12/19/how-rogue-one-ending-went-wrong/95519816/|newspaper=USA Today|access-date=19 August 2017 |quote="the Leia cameo is so jarring as to take the audience completely out of the film at its most emotional moment.

The use of virtual actors is in contrast with [[de-aging in film|digital de-aging]], which can involve simply removing wrinkles from actors' faces. This practice has generally not faced uncanny valley criticism. One exception is the 2019 film ''[[The Irishman]]'', in which [[Robert De Niro]], [[Al Pacino]] and [[Joe Pesci]] were all de-aged to try to make them look up to 50 years younger: one reviewer wrote that the actors' "hunched and stiff" body language stood in marked contrast to their facial appearance,<ref>{{cite web |title=The Irishman: De-aging De Niro was a waste of money |url=https://www.cnet.com/news/the-irishman-de-aging-robert-de-niro-was-a-waste-of-money/ |first=Richard |last=Trenholm |date=1 December 2019 |publisher=CNET}}</ref> while another wrote that when De Niro's character was in his 30s, he looked like he was 50.<ref name="some deepfaker">{{cite web |title=Some Deepfaker on YouTube Spent Seven Days Fixing the ###### De-Aging in The Irishman |url=https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/movies/a30432647/deepfake-youtube-video-fixes-the-irishman-de-aging/ |work=Esquire |first=Matt |last=Miller |date=7 January 2020}}</ref>

[[Deepfake]] software, which first began to be widely used in 2017, uses [[machine learning]] to graft one person's facial expressions onto another's appearance, thus providing an alternate approach to both creating virtual actors and digital de-aging. Various individuals have created web videos that use deepfake software to re-create some of the notable previous uses of virtual actors and de-aging in film.<ref name="some deepfaker" /><ref name="this video">{{cite web |title=This Video Uses the Power of Deepfakes to Re-Capture This Character's Cameo Appearance in Rogue One |url=https://io9.gizmodo.com/this-video-uses-the-power-of-deepfakes-to-re-capture-th-1828907452 |date=8 September 2018 |first=Julie |last=Muncy |work=Gizmodo}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=OCCLUSION VFX - Tron DeepFake |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tO_mg-Z4XWQ | archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211118/tO_mg-Z4XWQ| archive-date=18 November 2021 | url-status=live|via=YouTube |date=16 August 2019}}{{cbignore}}</ref> Journalists have tended to praise these deepfake imitations, calling them "more naturalistic"<ref name="this video" /> and "objectively better"<ref name="some deepfaker" /> than the originals.
