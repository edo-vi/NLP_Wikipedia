==Synopsis==
{{Original research section|date=May 2022|reason=Much of this extends beyond the realm of simple plot synopsis and into band minutiae.}}

The film begins with an extreme close-up of a television, switching between channels while odd gibberish noises play in the background. The film title is superimposed over the television screen.

The scene fades to a shot of a factory (filmed at the [[Goodyear World of Rubber]] in [[Akron, Ohio]]). Members of Devo in its quartet stage are seen in blue workmen's suits, operating machinery, until one notices it is time to go. All the band members wear clear face masks, except for [[Mark Mothersbaugh]], who appears in his [[Booji Boy]] mask. The members leave work and get into a car. They pull up in front of the burned out Kent bar The Water Street Saloon which was two buildings down from JB's in [[Kent, Ohio]]. The next clip shows them entering the front door of JB's, carrying instruments. A sign on the door reads "Tonight: 15-60-75", a reference to [[the Numbers Band]], which [[Gerald Casale]] played bass for at one point. The "Secret Agent Man" performance begins, featuring [[Bob Mothersbaugh]] on guitar, Gerald Casale on bass, [[Jim Mothersbaugh]] on electric bongos, and [[Mark Mothersbaugh]]/Booji Boy on synthesizers. The performance routinely cuts away to bizarre visuals, such as two men in monkey masks spanking a woman with [[Table tennis|ping-pong]] paddles, or a punk playing a double-neck guitar plugged into a space heater. The segment ends with a fadeout of Mark Mothersbaugh in a [[John F. Kennedy]] mask with a painted on bullet wound.

The "Jocko Homo" segment begins with Booji Boy running through a parking lot off of Front Street in [[Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio|Cuyahoga Falls]]. He enters a building through the fire escape to meet with [[General Boy]]. They exchange papers, and General Boy makes a statement: "In the past this information has been suppressed, but now it can be told. Every man, woman, and mutant on this planet shall know the truth about de-evolution." Booji replies with "Oh, dad, we're all devo!"

A series of rapid-fire cuts of the letters in "DEVO" appears (with the music of "Mechanical Man" found on ''[[Hardcore Devo: Volume One]]''), and then we cut to Mark Mothersbaugh in a [[Kent State University]] classroom (actually the Governance Chambers), delivering a lecture. As Mothersbaugh delivers the lyrics to "Jocko Homo" (this version can also be found on ''Hardcore Devo: Volume One''), the classroom enters a frenzy of excitement, ending in a near riot.

The film ends with a scene of Booji Boy being stabbed and his mask removed. Then the credits play in a style similarly to the title with an extremely distorted cover of "[[Because (Beatles song)|Because]]" by [[the Beatles]] playing. The film ends with a shot of the word "DEVO" in neon flashing off.

==In popular culture==
''The Truth About De-Evolution'' was included in a collection of film shorts that toured the country. On the west coast, [[Slash magazine]], [[Search & Destroy (punk zine)]] reprinted photos that they took off theater screens and television stations were provided copies for broadcast as publicity.<ref name="metrotimes-2466508">{{cite news |last1=Salant |first1=Shelley |title=Mutate, don’t stagnate: Mark Mothersbaugh in conversation |url=https://www.metrotimes.com/music/mutate-dont-stagnate-mark-mothersbaugh-in-conversation-2466508 |access-date=11 August 2022 |work=Detroit Metro Times |date=September 28, 2016 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=A Conversation with Artist & Musician Mark Mothersbaugh |url=https://computerhistory.org/blog/a-conversation-with-artist-musician-mark-mothersbaugh/ |website=[[Computer History Museum]] |access-date=11 August 2022 |language=en |date=11 March 2019}}</ref> Devo began sending videotapes to [[Saturday Night Live]], after Truth About De-Evolution, but until their new manager, Elliott Roberts, also Neil Young's manager arranged a musical performance and a broadcast of a clip from ''The Truth About De-Evolution''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Neil Young News: How Neil Young* Got DEVO on ‘Saturday Night Live’ in 1978 |url=http://neilyoungnews.thrasherswheat.org/2018/01/how-neil-young-got-devo-on-saturday.html |website=Thrasher's Wheat |access-date=11 August 2022 |language=en}}</ref>
