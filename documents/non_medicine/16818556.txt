January 2018 marked the beginning of the integration of AODME within AACOM. The integration bridges the gap between undergraduate and graduate medical education (GME) by providing leadership for the full continuum of osteopathic medical education. As part of the integration AODME will be renamed as the Assembly of Osteopathic Graduate Medical Educators (AOGME). <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.aacom.org/news-and-events/news-detail/2017/11/29/aacom-and-aodme-join-forces-to-strengthen-the-full-ome-continuum|title=AACOM and AODME Join Forces to Strengthen the Full OME Continuum|website=www.aacom.org|access-date=2018-01-22}}</ref>
