It was broadcast during the 1980s when the concept of the [[music video]] was being defined by record label's promotion and advertising departments, producers, directors and the TV channels who broadcast these short films.  Music videos before 1986, featured primarily rock and pop musicians.  When the Kendall Ross Bean Chopin: Polonaise in A flat classical music video was broadcast on the [[A&E (TV channel)|Arts and Entertainment Network]], it was not as fancy or as expensively produced as the major recording label's rock and pop videos.  But, it served the same function of promoting a classical pianist, as the rock music videos served in promoting rock artists.  It captured the interest of newscasters, Arts and Entertainment Network and the [[ACE Award]]s because of its novelty, and the camera shots revealing the usually hidden innards of the piano in performance.

==Live piano music for silent films sets the stage==
In the days of [[silent film]], a pianist, would play live music for theatre audiences to accompany the film for each showing.  Music was considered important in interpreting emotions, pacing and meaning of the film.<ref name="Silent Film">

[[Kendall Ross Bean]]'s grandmother, Knell Bean, was one of the many pianists across the country who played live piano for the silent movies. At the age of 4, Kendall was introduced to the piano and taught by his grandmother, who was his first piano teacher.<ref name="Pianist a Gem - highbeam">

==Early music performances on TV in the 1940s and 1950s==

In the 1940s, musicians and filmmakers created movie shorts known as Soundies. These films featured jazz or pop performers singing popular tunes in a studio or nightclub setting.<ref name="Pianist a Gem - wisegeek">

NBC had telecast a Metropolitan Opera presentation of ''[[Pagliacci]]'' on 10 March 1940, and all three major networks, [[NBC]], [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] and [[CBS]] featured classical music and opera on a semi-regular basis.<ref name="MusicOnTV">

[[Tony Terran]] played the trumpet in the first filmed television sitcom ''[[I Love Lucy]]'' and he was a trumpet player in the [[Desi Arnaz]] Orchestra, one of the first Rhythm and Blues combo bands on TV to use horns in the 1950s.

Through the 1970s live performance broadcasts of both classical, jazz, rock and pop music broadcasts of live performances continued to evolve.  But, they did not develop into the art form we know today as the music video until the 1980s.

==The Emergence of the Music Video in the 1980s==

Although music has been important to film and television from its inception, the music video of the 1980s placed the performer and the highly edited visuals in the spotlight with the definition of the music video as its own art form.

[[Music video]]s began as promotional films created by a music label's publicity department or an artist's management team. They showcased the artist performing an upcoming single from an unreleased album or a live performance of a current hit and involved camera editing techniques that were more elaborate than a typical live performance recording.

[[MTV]] was one of the first TV channels to broadcast a wide variety of rock and pop videos in the early 1980s.  "[[Video Killed the Radio Star]]" by the Buggles, was the first music video broadcast by MTV.  During the 1980s and 1990s, rock and pop music videos broadcast on television were being defined by MTV.<ref name="First MTV Video">

Rock and pop music videos and were often featured on [[primetime]] national and local news stations when they caught the public interest.  The media attention that MTV and its music videos received, led to the public associating the music video art form with the genre of rock and pop featuring major label's music stars.  When Arts and Entertainment Network, [[A&E (TV channel)|A&E]], aired the Kendall Ross Bean classical music video to 18 million people on July 23, 1986, the concept of a music video featuring an independent record label's classical pianist performing, was considered a novelty.<ref name="TV News">{{cite web|last=Jennings|first=Cheryl|title=ABC Evening News|url=http://abcnews.go.com|publisher=KGO Channel 7 TV|date=1 July 1986}}</ref><ref name="TV Entertainment Magazine" /><ref name="MusicOnTV" />  In the 1980s, there were very few outlets for [[Independent record label]]s because the market was dominated by the [[major label]]s.

Upon the airing of the Kendall Ross Bean Chopin Polonaise in A Flat on A&E, excerpts of this classical music video were also featured on TV stations during primetime news, TV magazine shows and in major newspapers while Kendall Bean was on tour in 1986.<ref name="TV News" /><ref name="TV Entertainment Magazine" /><ref name="Orlando group" /><ref name="Examiner group" />  This was one of the first times that a classical music video served the same promotional and publicity purpose for an independent classical pianist as the rock music videos were serving for rock stars on tour during the 1980s.<ref name="MTVkilledRadioStar" />

Since there were no dedicated classical music video TV broadcast channels in the 1980s, classical music videos were featured in between regular programming of various television stations along with  [[Public service announcement]]s.  A&E was one of the many networks that followed MTV's <ref name="MTVkilledRadioStar" /> example and began playing music videos.  A&E aired this classical music video in between its regular programming. Christina Haselfeld, spokeswomen for A&E in 1986, reported to the ''Orlando Sentinel'' that A&E's programing was geared primarily to features an hour or a half-hour in length.  She stated that it was A&E's plan to air the Bean classical music video for three years along with other compatible classical music programs.<ref name="Orlando group" />

The first showing of the Kendall Ross Bean Chopin Polonaise in A Flat on Arts and Entertainment Network was paired with the re-broadcast of the 1938 Masterpiece sound film, ''[[Alexander Nevsky (film)|Alexander Nevsky]]''.  In the Nevsky film, [[Sergei Eisenstein]] used an editing technique called "montage" that is used by filmmakers and music video directors to this day.<ref name="Nevsky">

==Bean Classical Music Video Description==

The video is 6 minutes and 55 seconds long.  It was a created in a partnership arranged by producer Karen Earle Lile<ref name="Film/TV Industry Listings">{{cite web|last=Imdb.com|title=Karen Lile, Producer|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm5277007|work=TV Broadcast Listings|publisher=Amazon|access-date=September 17, 2012}}</ref>   between Polara, and Independent Record label, and [[Tele-Communications Inc.]] doing business as Televents of Contra Costa in Lafayette, CA.<ref>{{cite web|title=Agenda|url=http://www.co.contra-costa.ca.us/archive.aspx?AMID=&Type=&ADID=589|publisher=Contra Costa County Board of Supervisors|access-date=November 30, 2004|author=Contra Costa County Board of Supervisors|page=C.150|quote=Televents, Inc. dba TCI Cablevision}}</ref>

It was created in the Original Local Programming Studio of Televents in Lafayette, California.  The video was created with two cameras and cut and dissolve edits.  Lile had the piano action removed and a glass box built around it so that the camera could film the hammers and action mechanism working.  [[Kendall Ross Bean]], a master piano rebuilder, rebuilt the Vintage Mason and Hamlin piano featured in the video and designed the glass box that the action was put in for the filming.<ref name="TV News" /><ref name="TV Entertainment Magazine" />

The music video features a piano performance of Frédéric Chopin's A flat Polonaise.  The sound used for the video was from a LP record album recorded by Kendall Ross Bean a couple of years before.  Bean finger-synced the music for each video shot by listening to the audio recording and duplicating the performance on the keyboard in the glass box first and then on the piano.  The video was shot from a story board and Bean had to finger sync for each section of the storyboard. It took several hours to film the video and Bean had to play for a moment or so to get up to speed every time a new camera angle was featured.<ref name="TV News" /><ref name="TV Entertainment Magazine" />
