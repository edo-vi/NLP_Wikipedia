{{Short description|1980 letter published in The New England Journal of Medicine}}

"'''Addiction Rare in Patients Treated with Narcotics'''" is the title of a [[letter to the editor]] written by Jane Porter and [[Hershel Jick]] and published in the January 10, 1980, issue of ''[[The New England Journal of Medicine]]''. The letter analyzed data on patients who had been treated with [[opioid]]s in a hospital setting, and concluded that addiction was uncommon among such patients. It has since been frequently misrepresented to claim that opioids are not addictive when prescribed for use at home, which has been blamed for contributing to the [[opioid epidemic in the United States]].

==Content==
The letter reported on an examination of medical files of patients who had been hospitalized and treated with small doses of [[opioid]]s. The authors concluded that of the 11,882 patients who received at least one narcotic drug, only four of them had developed a "reasonably well documented" addiction among patients who had no history of addiction. Its text read, in its entirety: {{blockquote|Recently, we examined our current files to determine the incidence of narcotic addiction in 39,946 hospitalized medical patients who were monitored consecutively. Although there were 11,882 patients who received at least one narcotic preparation, there were only four cases of reasonably well documented addiction in patients who had no history of addiction. The addiction was considered major in only one instance. The drugs implicated were meperidine in two patients, Percodan in one, and hydromorphone in one. We conclude that despite widespread use of narcotic drugs in hospitals, the development of addiction is rare in medical patients with no history of addiction.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Addiction Rare in Patients Treated with Narcotics|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|date=10 January 1980|volume=302|issue=2|pages=123|doi=10.1056/NEJM198001103020221|pmid=7350425|last1=Porter|first1=J.|last2=Jick|first2=H.|doi-access=free}}</ref>}}

==Influence==
The article has been cited extensively as evidence that addiction was very rare among patients who were prescribed narcotics (more specifically, opioids).<ref name=business>{{cite web | url=http://www.businessinsider.com/porter-and-jick-letter-launched-the-opioid-epidemic-2016-5 | title=This one-paragraph letter may have launched the opioid epidemic | work=Business Insider | date=26 May 2016 | accessdate=24 June 2017 | author=Jacobs, Harrison}}</ref><ref name=cnn>{{cite web | url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/06/01/health/opioid-epidemic-1980-letter-origins-study/index.html | title=One short letter's huge impact on the opioid epidemic | work=CNN | date=1 June 2017 | accessdate=24 June 2017 | author=Kounang, Nadia}}</ref> It became so well known that it is sometimes referred to simply as '''Porter and Jick'''.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2017/06/02/how-the-opioid-crisis-traces-back-to-a-five-sentence-scholarly-letter-from-1980/ | title=How a short letter in a prestigious journal contributed to the opioid crisis | newspaper=The Washington Post | date=2 June 2017 | accessdate=24 June 2017 | author=Hawkins, Derek}}</ref>

===Methodological limitations===
Methodological limitations from which the letter suffered included that the patients it reported on were all given opioids in small doses in a hospital.<ref name=business/><ref name=cnn/> Additionally, in 2003, Jick told ''[[The New York Times]]'' that the study did not follow patients after they left the hospital.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/11/25/science/the-delicate-balance-of-pain-and-addiction.html | title=The Delicate Balance Of Pain and Addiction | work=The New York Times | date=25 November 2003 | accessdate=24 June 2017 | author=Meier, Barry}}</ref>

===Misrepresentation===
In 2017, the letter attracted renewed interest because the ''New England Journal of Medicine'' published a bibliographic analysis of the letter showing that it had been cited 608 times since it was published. In comparison, the other letters to the editor in the same issue of the ''Journal'' as Porter and Jick's letter had been cited a median of 11 times.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.latimes.com/science/sciencenow/la-sci-sn-opioid-addiction-letter-20170531-story.html | title=How a 5-sentence letter helped fuel the opioid addiction crisis | work=Los Angeles Times | date=31 May 2017 | accessdate=25 June 2017 | author=Kaplan, Karen}}</ref> Of these 608 citations, the analysis also showed that 72.2% of them cited it in support of the claim that patients treated with opioids rarely developed addiction, and 80.8% did not mention that the letter only included data on prescriptions given to hospitalized patients.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Leung|first1=Pamela T.M.|last2=Macdonald|first2=Erin M.|last3=Stanbrook|first3=Matthew B.|last4=Dhalla|first4=Irfan A.|last5=Juurlink|first5=David N.|title=A 1980 Letter on the Risk of Opioid Addiction|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|date=June 2017|volume=376|issue=22|pages=2194–2195|doi=10.1056/NEJMc1700150|pmid=28564561}}</ref> It was also misrepresented in the popular media; a 1990 ''[[Scientific American]]'' article described it as an "extensive study," and a 2001 ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' story dubbed it a "landmark study" showing that concerns about opioid addiction were "basically unwarranted."<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2017/06/nejm-letter-opioids/528840/ | title=The One-Paragraph Letter From 1980 That Fueled the Opioid Crisis | work=The Atlantic | date=2 June 2017 | accessdate=24 June 2017 | author=Zhang, Sarah}}</ref> In addition, [[Purdue Pharma]], the manufacturer of [[OxyContin]], trained its sales representatives to say that the risk of addiction among patients using the drug was less than 1 percent, citing Porter and Jick's letter as one of their sources.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Van Zee|first1=Art|title=The Promotion and Marketing of OxyContin: Commercial Triumph, Public Health Tragedy|journal=American Journal of Public Health|date=February 2009|volume=99|issue=2|pages=221–227|doi=10.2105/AJPH.2007.131714|pmid=18799767|pmc=2622774}}</ref>

===Role in the opioid epidemic===
Because the letter has been frequently misrepresented to argue that opioids were rarely addictive, these misrepresentations have been blamed for contributing to the opioid epidemic.<ref name=cnn/><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2017/06/how_bad_footnotes_helped_cause_the_opioid_crisis.html | title=Bad Footnotes Can Be Deadly | work=Slate | date=11 June 2017 | accessdate=24 June 2017 | author=Engber, Daniel}}</ref> For example, a co-author of the 2017 bibliographic analysis, [[David Juurlink]], has stated that he thinks the letter's appearance in a prestigious journal helped convince doctors that opioids were safe, saying, "I think it's fair to say that this letter went quite a long way."<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-40136881 | title=Opioid crisis: The letter that started it all | work=BBC News | date=3 June 2017 | accessdate=24 June 2017}}</ref> Jick, who wrote the letter, has since said that "The letter wasn't of value to health and medicine in and of itself. So if I could take it back—if I knew then what I know now, I would never have published it. It wasn't worth it."<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2017/06/16/533060031/doctor-who-wrote-1980-letter-on-painkillers-regrets-that-it-fed-the-opioid-crisi | title=Doctor Who Wrote 1980 Letter On Painkillers Regrets That It Fed The Opioid Crisis | work=NPR | date=16 June 2017 | accessdate=24 June 2017 | author=Haney, Taylor}}</ref>
