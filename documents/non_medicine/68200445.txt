'''Intersex''' is a general term for an organism that has [[sex]] characteristics that are between [[male]] and [[female]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=intersex {{!}} Definition & Facts|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/intersex|access-date=2021-07-10|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|quote=Intersex, in biology, an organism having physical characteristics intermediate between a true male and a true female of its species.}}</ref> It typically applies to a minority of members of [[gonochoric]] animal species such as mammals (as opposed to [[hermaphroditic]] species in which the majority of members can have both male and female sex characteristics).<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3bsgS125KH0C&q=gonochoric+intersex+encyclopedia&pg=PP3932|title=Encyclopedia of Fish Physiology: From Genome to Environment|vauthors=Farrell A|date=2011-06-01|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0-08-092323-9|language=en|quote=Thus, strictly speaking, all hermaphrodites are intersex at one time point, but not all intersexes are hermaphrodites.

Intersexuality can occur due to both genetic and environmental factors<ref name="crust"/> and has been reported in [[Mammal|mammals]], [[Fish|fishes]], [[Nematode|nematodes]], and  [[Crustacean|crustaceans]].

== Mammals ==
Intersex can also occur in mammals such as hunans and [[pig]]s, with it being estimated that 0.1% to 1.4% of pigs are intersex.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Hunter|first1=R. H.

At least six different mole species have an intersex adaption where by the female mole has an [[ovotestis]], "a hybrid organ made up of both ovarian and testicular tissue. This effectively makes them intersex, giving them an extra dose of testosterone to make them just as muscular and aggressive as male moles". The ovarian part of the ovotestis is reproductively functional.<ref>https://www.cbc.ca/radio/quirks/oct-17-coronavirus-and-pain-sampling-an-asteroid-intersex-moles-and-more-1.5763905/female-moles-are-intersex-they-have-testicle-like-tissue-that-helps-them-grow-big-and-tough-1.5763925,''CBC Radio'', accessed 2023-04-13</ref><ref>https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aaz2582, Francisca M.

Intersexuality in humans is relatively rare. Depending on the definition, the [[prevalence]] of [[intersex]] among humans have been reported to range from 0.018%<ref>{{Cite Q | Q34163911 }}</ref><ref name=witchel>{{cite journal |author=Selma Feldman Witchel |title=Disorders of Sex Development |journal=Best Practice & Research.

== Nematodes ==
Intersex is known to occur in all main groups of  [[nematode]]s. Most of them are functionally female. Male intersexes with female characteristics have been reported but are less common.<ref>{{Cite book|last=El-Bawab|first=Fatma|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m_rKDwAAQBAJ&dq=gonochorism+invertebrates&pg=PA293|title=Invertebrate Embryology and Reproduction|date=2020-01-18|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0-12-814115-1|pages=431|language=en}}</ref>

== Fishes ==
Gonadal intersex also occurs in fishes, where the individual has both ovarian and testicular tissue. Although it is a rare anomaly among gonochoric fishes, it is a transitional state in fishes that are [[protandric]] or [[protogynous]].<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Norris|first1=David O.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HKv3mC5Eb34C&dq=intersex+fishes&pg=PA250|title=Hormones and Reproduction of Vertebrates|last2=Lopez|first2=Kristin H.|date=2010-11-25|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0-08-095809-5|pages=249–251|language=en}}</ref> Intersexuality has been reported in 23 fish families.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Pandian|first=T.

== Crustaceans ==
