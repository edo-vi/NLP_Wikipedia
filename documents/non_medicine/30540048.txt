'''Cocooning''', also known as '''the Cocoon Strategy''',<ref name=cocooning>{{Cite journal | last1 = Healy | first1 = C. M. | last2 = Rench | first2 = M. A. | last3 = Baker | first3 = C. J. | doi = 10.1093/cid/ciq001 | title = Implementation of Cocooning against Pertussis in a High-Risk Population | journal = Clinical Infectious Diseases | volume = 52 | issue = 2 | pages = 157–162 | year = 2010 | pmid = 21288837 | doi-access = free }}</ref> is a [[vaccination]] strategy to protect infants and other vulnerable individuals from infectious diseases by vaccinating those in close contact with them. If the people most likely to transmit an infection are [[Immunity (medical)|immune]], their immunity creates a "cocoon" of protection around the newborn (or other vulnerable person).

Cocooning is especially commonly used for [[pertussis]]. It aims to protect newborn infants from becoming infected with [[pertussis]] by administering [[DTaP]]/Tdap (tetanus, [[diphtheria]] and acellular pertussis) [[booster vaccine]] to parents, family members and any individuals who would come into regular contact with the newborn infant. By vaccinating these individuals with a pertussis booster, a pool of persons is established around the newborn who are themselves protected from getting pertussis and passing it on to the infant, thereby creating a "cocoon" of protection around the newborn. Young infants have the highest rate of pertussis; in 87-100% of all deaths caused by pertussis, the victim is an infant of less than 6 months of age, too young to have finished acquiring vaccine-induced immunity. Adolescents and young adults whose immunity has just worn off are often infected, but very unlikely to die. They can, however, infect others.<ref name=cocooning/><ref name="Spain">{{cite journal |last1=Campins |first1=Magda |last2=Moreno-Pérez |first2=David |last3=Gil-de Miguel |first3=Angel |last4=González-Romo |first4=Fernando |last5=Moraga-Llop |first5=Fernando A. |last6=Arístegui-Fernández |first6=Javier |last7=Goncé-Mellgren |first7=Anna |last8=Bayas |first8=José M. |last9=Salleras-Sanmartí |first9=Lluís |title=[Whooping cough in Spain.

==Rationale==
[[File:HumanNewborn.JPG|thumb|250px|A newborn has very little [[Immunity (medical)|immunity]] to [[virus]]es]]

Some people cannot be fully protected from vaccine-preventable diseases by direct vaccination. These are often people with weak immune systems, who are more likely to get seriously ill. Their risk of infection can be significantly reduced if those who are most likely to infect them get the appropriate vaccines.{{citation needed|date=May 2020}}

Vaccination works by training the immune system to react promptly to an infection, warding off illness ([[acquired immunity]]). People with weak immune systems may have difficulty acquiring and retaining immunity.{{medref-inline|date=May 2019}}

A baby's [[immune system]] is not yet fully developed. Babies are more likely to have serious complications or die from diseases, even diseases that have milder effects in adults.<ref name=babyproofing/><ref name=tiles/> A baby can use some antibodies from the mother, transmitted in the womb. For this reason, it is recommended that people who are expecting to become pregnant get some vaccines, and those who are pregnant get others.<ref name="CIDclinguide"/><ref name=babyproofing/><ref name=tiles/> However, this maternal protection wears off after a few months.<ref name=babyproofing>{{cite web |title=Ultimate Babyproofing Plan {{!}} Parents {{!}} Vaccines {{!}} CDC |url=https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/parents/resources/ultimate-babyproofing-plan.html |website=www.cdc.gov |publisher=US Centers for Disease Control |access-date=19 May 2019 |language=en-us |date=6 December 2018}}</ref><ref name=tiles>{{cite web |title=Vaccine-Preventable Disease Tile Infographics {{!}} CDC |url=https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/parents/infographics/vaccine-preventable-disease-tiles.html |website=www.cdc.gov |publisher=US Centers for Disease Control |language=en-us |date=6 December 2018}}</ref> Breastfeeding also offers protection, but is not as effective as vaccination at preventing some diseases.<ref name=babyproofing/>

Some people have [[immuno-compromised|compromised immune systems]]. The [[immune system]] can be compromised by [[congenital medical conditions]], infectious diseases, non-infectious conditions such as cancer, and [[immunosuppressive]] medications or treatments (for instance, people with [[organ transplant]]s take drugs to prevent their immune system from killing the transplant). People who are severely immuno-compromised may not be able to take some vaccines; on the other hand, they may be much more severely affected by an infection.<ref name="immunocomp">{{cite web |title=MODULE 2 – Immunizing the immunocompromised - WHO Vaccine Safety Basics |url=https://vaccine-safety-training.org/immunizing-the-immunocompromised.html |website=vaccine-safety-training.org |publisher=World Health Organisation |access-date=19 May 2019}}</ref><ref name="CIDclinguide">{{cite journal |last1=Kang |first1=Insoo |last2=Keyserling |first2=Harry |last3=Sung |first3=Lillian |last4=Dhanireddy |first4=Shireesha |last5=Bousvaros |first5=Athos |last6=Tomblyn |first6=Marcie |last7=Avery |first7=Robin |last8=Davies |first8=E.

They benefit when their housemates get all the recommended [[inactivated vaccine]]s. They also benefit if their housemates get many [[attenuated vaccine]]s. However, some attenuated vaccines are not recommended for people living with immuno-compromised people, depending on the vaccine and cause of immune suppression.<ref name="CIDclinguide"/>

Some vaccines require multiple doses, spaced over time, to be effective. Those who have not yet received all the doses (including all young babies) are not yet fully immune, and rely on the immunity of those around them.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.immunize.org/catg.d/p4039.pdf| title=Cocooning Protects Babies}}</ref> Some vaccines also require [[booster shots|booster doses]] in later life; those who have not received their booster doses can be infected and infect others.<ref name=cocooning/>

ACIP states that cocooning provides maximum protection to the infant beyond what is provided by maternal vaccination. ACIP is recommending that all relatives and caregivers get vaccinated against pertussis at least two weeks before coming into contact with infants.<ref name=CDC/> While acceptance of cocooning is high, implementation in not yet widespread as of 2012.<ref name="concept">{{cite journal |last1=Grizas |first1=Alexandra P. |last2=Camenga |first2=Deepa |last3=Vázquez |first3=Marietta |title=Cocooning: a concept to protect young children from infectious diseases |journal=Current Opinion in Pediatrics |date=2012 |volume=24 |issue=1 |pages=92–97 |doi=10.1097/MOP.0b013e32834e8fe9 |pmid=22157361 |s2cid=27726049 |issn=1531-698X}}</ref>
