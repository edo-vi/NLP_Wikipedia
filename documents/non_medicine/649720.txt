An '''aside''' is a [[Glossary of theater terms|dramatic device]] in which a [[Character (arts)|character]] speaks to the [[audience]]. By convention, the audience is to realize that the character's speech is unheard by the other characters on stage. It may be addressed to the audience expressly (in character or out) or represent an unspoken thought. An aside is usually a brief comment rather than a speech, such as a [[monologue]] or [[soliloquy]]. 

The aside was used by [[Ian Richardson]]'s character [[Francis Urquhart]] in the 1990 [[BBC]] mini-series ''[[House of Cards (UK TV series)|House of Cards]]'', as well as by [[Kevin Spacey]]'s character Frank Underwood in the 2013 [[Netflix]] [[House of Cards (U.S. TV series)|original series of the same name]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Zach Seward|work=medium.com|url=https://medium.com/house-of-cards/b54a60143519|title=House of Cards' fourth wall|date=May 10, 2013}}</ref> It can be used to explain the often complex politics on the show, describe what the character's plans/emotions are or simply for humorous effect.

It was also used by [[Michaela Coel]]â€™s character Tracey in the Channel 4 comedy series [[Chewing Gum (TV series)|''Chewing Gum'']]; and by the titular character in ''[[Fleabag]]'', written and played by [[Phoebe Waller-Bridge]].<ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Hunt |first=El |date=2019-03-29 |title='Fleabag' proves that Phoebe Waller-Bridge is the master of the monologue |url=https://www.nme.com/blogs/fleabags-phoebe-waller-bridge-master-monologue-2468797 |magazine=NME |language=en-GB}}</ref>
