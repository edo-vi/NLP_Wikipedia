Tarasova/Morozov took gold in both of their Grand Prix outings, entering the Grand Prix Final in joint first place with the reigning World champions [[Sui Wenjing]] / [[Han Cong]]. A personal best in the short program placed them a very close second to [[Aliona Savchenko]] / [[Bruno Massot]], but a sixth-place result in the free skate dropped them to fifth overall, 2.10 points behind bronze medalists [[Megan Duhamel]] / [[Eric Radford]]. At the [[2018 European Figure Skating Championships|2018 European Championships]], they placed fifth in the short program, keeping them out of the final flight in the final segment. A personal best in the free skate allowed them to climb to first and win their second consecutive European title, leading a Russian sweep of the podium.

At the [[2018 Winter Olympics]] in [[Pyeongchang]], Tarasova/Morozov skated the short program portion of the [[Figure skating at the 2018 Winter Olympics - Team event|team event]], placing first over both Duhamel/Radford and Savchenko/Massot. This helped the Olympic Athletes of Russia to a silver medal. Their short program in [[Figure skating at the 2018 Winter Olympics - Pairs|the individual event]] put them in position for a possible gold medal, as they were second, less than a point out of the lead. However, skating last, they committed two major errors during the free skate and dropped out of the medals into fourth place.<ref name=Oly2018/> After the event, Morozov indicated that he felt that they had failed to control their nerves.<ref name=TASS180215/>

Tarasova/Morozov concluded their season at the [[2018 World Figure Skating Championships|2018 World Championships]] in [[Milan]].

In May 2018, Mozer announced that she would take a break from coaching until September and that [[Maxim Trankov]] and [[Robin Szolkowy]] would serve as Tarasova/Morozov's coaches.<ref name=IFS180516/><ref name=GS180728/>

===2018–2019 season===

Following the free skate, Tarasova said, "overall, the skate was done well, the program was done well. Some points of the program, I was a little clumsy, but today I am happier with my skating than I was yesterday."<ref name=GS181209/>

At the [[2019 Russian Figure Skating Championships|2019 Russian Championships]], Tarasova/Morozov led the short program, with Tarasova stepping out of the exit on the pairs spin, which she described as a "control issue."<ref name=GS181220/>  They also won the free skate, skating cleanly for the first time that season and securing their second national title.  Morozov said, "we're happy with the result and with our performance. It was hard after the Final, but we managed."<ref name=GS181222/>

Competing next at the [[2019 European Figure Skating Championships|2019 European Championships]], Tarasova/Morozov placed second in the short program, behind [[Vanessa James]] / [[Morgan Ciprès]], after Tarasova underrotated her triple toe loop jump. They had returned to their acclaimed [[Sergei Rachmaninoff|Rachmaninoff]] short program from the 2017–18 season for the remainder, at the insistence of their coaches, with Tarasova noting that it was "more powerful to skate."<ref name=GS190123/>  They placed second in the free skate, with Tarasova underrotating and stepping out of their three-jump combination, but otherwise without issues, and took the silver medal overall.  Morozov said they were "obviously very disappointed by this defeat, by losing the gold medal. Like yesterday, the whole skate was good except one jump element. Without that, all the rest was good. We gave it away ourselves today."<ref name=GS190124/>

At their final event of the season, the [[2019 World Figure Skating Championships|2019 World Championships]], Tarasova/Morozov led after the short program, setting a new world record.<ref name=GS190320/>  They came second in the free skate, being a returning Sui/Han, and won their second consecutive silver medal.  Tarasova reflected on the event: "We skated both programs clean. There were some minor mistakes in our free program. It was difficult to skate today; I had to fight with myself. I managed to perform all the elements, and I was happy for that. To tell the truth, I felt the same as during the Olympics Games. I had some mistakes at the training session, and I felt rather the same. I managed to overcome my emotions and skate well."<ref name=GS190321/>

===2019–2020 season===
Following the end of the 2018–19 season, Tarasova and Morozov announced that they were moving to train in the United States under coach [[Marina Zoueva]].  Morozov later explained that they "went to Marina to work with her on what we were lacking."<ref name=IFS190917/>

In their first competition of the season, Tarasova/Morozov competed at the [[2019 CS U.S. International Figure Skating Classic|2019 U.S. Classic]].  Errors in both programs, including an aborted lift in the free skate, caused them to finish second, behind American champions [[Ashley Cain-Gribble|Cain-Gribble]]/[[Timothy LeDuc|LeDuc]].<ref name=NBC191018/>  Continuing onto the [[2019-20 ISU Grand Prix of Figure Skating|Grand Prix]], their first assignment was [[2019 Skate Canada International]].  Morozov popped their planned side-by-side triple toe loop in the short program, causing them to place third in that segment.<ref name=GS191026/>  In the free skate, Tarasova's popping a planned triple Salchow and then a failed lift kept them in third.  Morozov deemed it "not the best performance of our team."<ref name=GS191027/>  At the [[2019 Rostelecom Cup]], competing for the second time against countrymen [[Aleksandra Boikova|Boikova]]/[[Dmitrii Kozlovskii|Kozlovskii]], the gold medalists at Skate Canada, Tarasova/Morozov were second in the short program after errors by Morozov on the side-by-side spins and the step sequence.<ref name=GS191115/>  Second in the free skate as well, they won the silver medal.<ref name=GS191116/>

Tarasova/Morozov placed first in the short program at the [[2020 Russian Figure Skating Championships|2020 Russian Championships]], skating cleanly for the first time that season.<ref name=GS191226/>  Second in the free skate, with Tarasova doubling a planned triple jump, they lost the gold medal by 0.47 points.  She called the result "a bit upsetting, but the result was to be expected after my mistake. The most important competitions are still to come."<ref name=GS191227/>

In what would prove to be Tarasova/Morozov's final event of the season, they competed at the [[2020 European Figure Skating Championships|2020 European Championships]].  After successfully landing their jumps and throw in the short program, Morozov stumbled in their lift, requiring them to abort it, and placed third in that segment.  Tarasova remarked afterward, "I was not frightened — Vladimir held me tight. It’s an annoying nuisance."<ref name=GS200122/>  Second in the free program, they won the silver medal despite jump errors.<ref name=GS200124/>  They had been assigned to compete at the [[2020 World Figure Skating Championships|World Championships]] in [[Montreal]], but they were cancelled as a result of the [[2019-20 COVID-19 pandemic|coronavirus pandemic]].<ref name=CBC200311/>

With the pandemic complicating international travel, Tarasova/Morozov had planned to compete in the first two stages of the domestic [[Russian Figure Skating Cup|Russian Cup]] series before returning to the United States to train for [[2020 Skate America|Skate America]].  This plan was disrupted by Morozov's contracting [[COVID-19]].  Coach [[Maxim Trankov]] expressed hope that "the form is mild."<ref name=IFS200920/> On October 8, Trankov announced that Tarasova and Morozov would be skipping the Grand Prix series due to a lack of training time and would be concentrating on the Russian Cup series.<ref name=RS201008/>  They did not appear at the senior Russian test skates in early September.<ref name=IFS200914/>

After recovery, Tarasova/Morozov had three weeks to prepare to compete at the [[2021 Russian Figure Skating Championships|2021 Russian Championships]].<ref name=GS210106/>  There they won the short program with a clean skate while the other top teams made errors.<ref name=GS201224/>  Winning the free skate as well, despite Tarasova falling on their final throw jump and an error on their pair spin, they reclaimed the Russian national title from Boikova/Kozlovskii.<ref name=GS201226/> Morozov later remarked that they had "mixed feelings about our program" due to the late errors, but overall they were pleased by the progress they had made. They were assigned to compete at the [[2021 World Figure Skating Championships|2021 World Championships]] in [[Stockholm]].<ref name=GS210106/>
