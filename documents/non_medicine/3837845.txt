Freud first introduced the concept of identification in his 1921 book ''[[Group Psychology and the Analysis of the Ego]]'', where he referred to it as “the original form of emotional tie with an object”.<ref name=":0" /> He initially detected the occurrence of identification whilst analysising his patient's dreams for therapeutic purposes.<ref name=":1" /> In his later works, he isolated three separate modes of identification: primary identification, hysterical identification, and narcissistic identification.<ref name=":0" />

In Freudian psychoanalysis, identification is largely considered a process "in which something previously experienced as external becomes internal".<ref>{{Cite book |author=Moore, Burness E. Fine, Bernard D. |url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/47011054 |title=Psychoanalysis : the major concepts |date=1995 |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=0-585-35103-1 |oclc=47011054}}</ref> Primary identification, however, is defined by psychoanalysts as a "state" of experienced oneness with the object, where the distinction between the self and non-self is suspended.<ref name=":0" /> According to Freud, hysterical identification is a secondary form of identification, denoting a process whereby a change occurs in the self-concept of the subject so that they become more like the object.<ref name=":0" /> Furthermore, narcissistic identification is an aggressive form of identification which follows on from hysterical identification, in which the subject wishes to become the object in order to take its place. Freud states that narcissistic identification is the beginning of the [[Oedipus complex]], in which the child desires to replace their same-sex parent.<ref name=":32">{{Cite journal |last=Chase |first=Cynthia |date=1979 |title=Oedipal Textuality: Reading Freud's Reading of Oedipus |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/464700 |journal=Diacritics |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=54–68 |doi=10.2307/464700 |issn=0300-7162 |jstor=464700}}</ref>

{{Main articles|Psychoanalytic literary criticism}}
[[Psychoanalytic literary criticism]] is a method of reading and analysing texts through the lens of [[Psychoanalytic theory|psychoanalytic]] principles.<ref name=":22" /> It is largely informed by [[Psychoanalysis|Freudian]] psychoanalysis, but has since grown into its own field in literary theory, influenced by the work of psychoanalysts such as [[Carl Jung]], [[Melanie Klein]], and [[Jacques Lacan]].<ref name=":2">{{Cite book |last=Ellmann |first=Maud |url=https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/9781317896784 |title=Psychoanalytic Literary Criticism |date=2014-01-14 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-317-89678-4 |edition=0 |language=en |doi=10.4324/9781315845074}}</ref>

Identification is a key concept in psychoanalytic literary criticism.<ref name=":2" /> Drawing upon the large body of [[psychoanalytic theory]], Merav Roth identified seven forms of identification which can occur whilst reading literature.<ref name=":22" /> Among these are; internalised identification, where parts of a character are internalised to become parts of the reader, internalised identification with ‘good’ objects or characters is part of the pleasure of reading and can repair the individuals sense of internal goodness; projective identification, where an individual projects an aspect of themselves onto an object, used to distance oneself from anxiety, readers can project traits onto a character in order to work through them; and intrusive identification, whereby a character penetrates the psyche of the reader, momentarily suspending the reader within the narrative as an extreme form of empathy.<ref name=":22" />

{{See also|Carl Jung|Jungian archetypes|Joseph Campbell}}[[Archetypal literary criticism]] is a critical framework for literary analysis which draws on the principles of [[analytical psychology]] by interpreting texts through the lens of recurring [[myth]]s and [[archetype]]s.<ref name=":3" /> Archetypal literary criticism draws heavily on the work of psychoanalyst [[Carl Jung]], a friend and colleague of Freud’s who branched out from Freudian psychoanalysis to establish the field of [[analytical psychology]].<ref name=":3">{{Citation |last=Gill |first=Glen Robert |title=Archetypal Criticism: Jung and Frye |date=2018-04-16 |url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781118958933.ch32 |work=A Companion to Literary Theory |pages=396–407 |editor-last=Richter |editor-first=David H. |place=Chichester, UK |publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Ltd |language=en |doi=10.1002/9781118958933.ch32 |isbn=978-1-118-95893-3 |access-date=2022-05-08}}</ref> In archetypal criticism, identification occurs between the reader and the archetype which a character is modelled from, either knowingly or unknowingly by the author.<ref name=":3" /> For the reader to identify with the [[Hero's journey|hero archetype]], for example, is a cathartic experience as they are freed from the worries and emotions of their everyday life to momentarily become a powerful hero operating inside a contained fantasy.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Jauss |first1=Hans Robert |last2=Bennett |first2=Benjamin |last3=Bennett |first3=Helga |date=1974 |title=Levels of Identification of Hero and Audience |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/468397 |journal=New Literary History |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=283 |doi=10.2307/468397|jstor=468397 }}</ref>

[[Northrop Frye]] was considered to be one of the most influential literary critics of the 20th century and a pioneering figure of archetypal criticism after Jung.<ref name=":3" /> In his 1990 book ''Words with Power'', Frye proposed the literary device of [[metaphor]] to be a method of inciting identification in the reader.<ref name=":3" /> Frye said that a metaphor not only identifies one thing with another, but both things with the reader, creating an experience of identification which merges the reader with the text.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.3138/9781442677852/html |title=Northrop Frye: Eastern and Western Perspectives |date=2003-12-31 |publisher=University of Toronto Press |isbn=978-1-4426-7785-2 |editor-last=Ning |editor-first=Wang |doi=10.3138/9781442677852 |editor-last2=O'Grady |editor-first2=Jean }}</ref>

In Lacanian theory, the [[Mirror Phase|mirror phase]] is the most important occurrence of identification, and is partially re-lived through all subsequent identifications, such as those experienced when watching a film or reading literature.<ref name=":5">{{Cite book |last=Metz |first=Christian |url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/809571210 |title=Psychoanalysis and cinema : the imaginary signifier |date=1997 |publisher=Macmillan |isbn=0-333-27805-4 |oclc=809571210}}</ref> The mirror phase identification is the moment of separation of the ideal fantasy self, similar to Freud’s [[Ego psychology|ego]], with the real self, or in other words, the concept of self with the actual self.

[[File:Alfred Hitchcock 1955.jpg|thumb|[[Alfred Hitchcock]] the "master of suspense", circa 1955]]
{{Main article|Alfred Hitchcock}}
Alfred Hitchcock was an English [[New Wave cinema|new wave]] filmmaker, considered to be one of the most distinguished directors in the history of cinema and nicknamed the 'Master of Suspense' for his long career of making [[Thriller film|thriller]] films, many of which are critically regarded as masterpieces, such as ''[[Rear Window]]'' (1954), ''[[Vertigo]]'' (1958), and [[Psycho (1960 film)|''Psycho'']] (1960).<ref>{{Cite book |last=Freedman |first=Jonathan |url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/931996736 |title=The Cambridge companion to Alfred Hitchcock |date=2015 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-1-107-10757-1 |oclc=931996736}}</ref> Hitchcock used the process of viewer identification as a technique to establish suspense, stating that the more invested the audience is in the fate of the character, the more "urgent and keen" a viewing experience.<ref name=":7">{{Cite book |last=Hitchcock |first=Alfred |url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/909139700 |title=Hitchcock on Hitchcock: selected writings and interviews. |year=1899–1980 |isbn=978-0-520-27958-2 |oclc=909139700}}</ref>

One way in which Hitchcock established viewer identification in his films was through camera work.<ref name=":8" /> Hitchcock pioneered the use of frequent protagonist [[point-of-view shot]]s, combined with [[shot/reverse shot]] sequences between the protagonist's eyes or profile and the object, which worked to keep the audience inside the protagonist's consciousness, thus providing a strong basis for identification.<ref name=":8">{{Cite book |first1=David |last1=Boyd |first2=R.

Hitchcock subverted traditional Hollywood films by inciting viewer identification with flawed characters.<ref name=":8" /><ref name=":6" /> The "Shower Scene" in Hitchcock's 1960 film ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' is one of the most iconic scenes in the history of cinema.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Kumar |first=Arun |date=2022-02-28 |title=50 Most Famous Movie Scenes Of All Time |url=https://flickside.com/famous-movie-scenes/ |access-date=2022-05-28 |website=Flickside |language=en-US}}</ref> Critics have argued that this is due to Hitchcock's exploitation of viewer identification.<ref name=":8" /> The audience identifies and sympathises with Marion, the female lead, up until the point of her brutal murder in the shower by [[Norman Bates]], in which, according to critic [[Robin Wood (critic)|Robin Wood]], "Hitchcock uses all the resources of identification to make [the viewer] 'become' Norman".<ref name=":9" /> Wood argues that this use of identification is central to Hitchcock's work due to his interest in the "potential for abnormality".<ref name=":9" /> Likewise, critic Laura Mulvey stated that Hitchcock used identification to expose the perverted aspects of the audience's consciousness.<ref name=":6" />
