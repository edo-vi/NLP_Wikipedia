In [[gridiron football]] and its variants, [[American football]] and [[Canadian football]], the [[quarterback]] position is often considered the most important on the team. While there have been a growing number of players of African or minority descent throughout the history of collegiate and professional football, black players have historically faced difficulty in landing and retaining quarterback roles due to a number of factors. In addition, some black quarterbacks claim to have experienced bias towards or against them due to their race. Black players as a whole are disproportionately over represented in the NFL, being only ~13% of the U.S. population yet 67% of NFL players are black, with 17% of quarterbacks being black.<ref name="Undefeated1" />

== History ==
Since the earliest days of professional and college football, the number of black players, let alone quarterbacks, has been on the rise. The first black quarterback to start professionally was [[Bernie Custis]] for the [[Hamilton Tiger-Cats]] of the [[Canadian Football League]] in 1951.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/football/bernic-custis-pro-footballs-first-black-quarterback-dies-at-age-88/article34122046/ |title=Bernie Custis, pro football's first black quarterback, dies at 88 |last=Maki |first=Allan |date=May 17, 2018 |work=The Globe and Mail |access-date=February 13, 2019}}</ref> The first two in the United States were [[Marlin Briscoe]] and [[James Harris (quarterback)|James Harris]], both of the [[American Football League]], in 1968 and 1969, respectively.<ref name = WaPostHarris>{{Cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/made-by-history/wp/2018/02/02/the-quarterback-who-paved-the-way-for-colin-kaepernicks-protests/ |title=The quarterback who paved the way for Colin Kaepernick's protests |last=Friedman |first=Samuel G. |date=February 2, 2018 |newspaper=The Washington Post |access-date=February 13, 2019 |language=en}}</ref>{{efn|[[Willie Thrower]] played a game for the [[Chicago Bears]] of the NFL in 1953.

The CFL was [[History of African Americans in the Canadian Football League#Black quarterbacks|more welcoming]] to black quarterbacks than its American counterparts during the mid-twentieth century.

Holloway was drafted into the NFL by the [[New England Patriots]], but he was drafted as a defensive back not a quarterback. As such Holloway chose to play in Canada where he could play quarterback and had a very successful career including being on the roster of the championship teams of the [[64th Grey Cup]] and the [[71st Grey Cup]], as well as be chosen as an all-star and winning the CFL [[CFL's Most Outstanding Player Award|equivalent of league MVP]] in 1982.<ref>{{cite web|title=Conredge Holloway Jr. and the Barriers He Broke For African Americans

There is some controversy over how white and black quarterbacks tend to be described by the media, especially with NFL draft prospects. Draft experts and scouts have a history of describing black quarterbacks in ways that perpetuate racial stereotypes and hurt those prospects' chances of making it to the NFL as a quarterback.<ref name="Bigler 2008">{{Cite journal|last1=Bigler|first1=Matthew|last2=Jeffries|first2=Judson L.|date=2008-03-04|title="An Amazing Specimen": NFL Draft Experts' Evaluations of Black Quarterbacks|journal=Journal of African American Studies|language=en|volume=12|issue=2|pages=120–141|doi=10.1007/s12111-008-9036-7|s2cid=144737851|issn=1559-1646}}</ref> Even those who make it to the NFL allegedly continue to face this narrative.<ref name="Tyrod debate ESPN">{{cite web | url=http://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/21251222/the-great-debate-buffalo-bills-quarterback-tyrod-taylor | title=The great Tyrod Taylor debate | publisher=[[ESPN]] | date=November 2, 2017 | author=Kimes, Mina}}</ref>

An empirical study published in ''The Howard Journal of Communications'' supported this hypothesis. The researchers analyzed the written descriptions of quarterback prospects in the NFL Draft section of the ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' website from 1998 to 2007. They looked at each player's description for words or phrases about athleticism and intelligence and sorted them into categories based on whether they were positive or negative. A significant difference was found between how black and white quarterbacks are described by ''SI''. Black quarterbacks tend to be praised for their athleticism and criticized for a lack of intelligence. Meanwhile, white quarterbacks are often praised for their intelligence and criticized for a lack of athleticism.<ref name="Mercurio 2010">{{Cite journal|last1=Mercurio|first1=Eugenio|last2=Filak|first2=Vincent F.|date=2010-01-29|title=Roughing the Passer: The Framing of Black and White Quarterbacks Prior to the NFL Draft|journal=Howard Journal of Communications|language=en|volume=21|issue=1|pages=56–71|doi=10.1080/10646170903501328|s2cid=144208873|issn=1064-6175}}</ref> For example, [[Daunte Culpepper]] and [[Tee Martin]], both black quarterbacks, were described with terms such as "physical specimen" and "impressive specimen," respectively.

===Wonderlic testing===
Until 2022, players were given the [[Wonderlic Personnel Test]], a test of mental aptitude, at the [[NFL Scouting Combine]]. As of 2018, the average score of active Super Bowl winning quarterbacks was 30.7 which is particularly salient given the fact that a score of 22 is average and the position average is about 24. This list of winning quarterbacks included [[Russell Wilson]], who got a score of 28. Of all positions, quarterbacks and offensive linemen, particularly centers, had the highest average scores as well as the greatest percentage of white players. [[Tight end]], the position with the next highest position average, also had a greater percentage of white players relative to the league average.<ref name="Undefeated1">{{Cite web |url=https://andscape.com/features/the-nfls-racial-divide/ |title=The NFL's racial divide |last=Jane McManus and Jason Reid |website=[[Andscape]]|date=2017-04-26 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.outkickthecoverage.com/nfl-quarterback-wonderlic-scores-matter-a-great-deal-042417/ | date=April 24, 2017 | author=Clay Travis | title=NFL Quarterback Wonderlic Scores Matter A Great Deal| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170427110423/https://www.outkickthecoverage.com/nfl-quarterback-wonderlic-scores-matter-a-great-deal-042417/ | archive-date=2017-04-27 }}</ref>

=== Marlin Briscoe ===
After a successful college career as a quarterback, the [[Denver Broncos]] drafted [[Marlin Briscoe]] in the 14th round of the [[1968 NFL/AFL draft]], with plans to shift him to the defensive secondary.

=== James Harris ===
[[James Harris (quarterback)|James "Shack" Harris]] became the first black quarterback to start for the Bills and was the second overall to start for a team in NFL history. After being released by the Bills and signing with the [[Los Angeles Rams]], Harris stepped in for injured Rams starter [[John Hadl]] in 1974, and head coach [[Chuck Knox]] made him the permanent starter, a first for any black quarterback and second overall since the AFL–NFL merger after [[Joe Gilliam]] briefly replaced [[Terry Bradshaw]] earlier that season for the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]].

===Kordell Stewart===
After spending his first years in the NFL as a backup quarterback and [[utility player]], [[Kordell Stewart]], nicknamed "Slash" due to his versatility, won the starting position for the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] in 1997. After a productive 1997 season at quarterback, Stewart struggled after his offensive coordinator [[Chan Gailey]] left to become head coach of the [[Dallas Cowboys]], and at one point in 1998 was ordered by head coach [[Bill Cowher]] to attend wide receiver meetings instead of quarterback meetings, though he would eventually return to the quarterback position in 1999. During this time, rumors surfaced that Stewart had been arrested after being caught doing sexual acts with another man in [[Schenley Park]], leading to ongoing rumors of Stewart's sexuality to this day. Stewart himself acknowledged that he believed the rumors were race-based and no such police report exists on Stewart's arrest, confirming that the rumors were false.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Hall |first=Jason |date=2021-02-05 |title=Former NFL Quarterback Opens Up About Rumors He Was Gay |url=https://foxsportsradio.iheart.com/content/2021-02-05-former-nfl-quarterback-opens-up-about-rumors-he-was-gay/ |access-date=2021-11-04 |website=FOX Sports Radio |language=en}}</ref><ref name="Kordell Player">{{Cite web |last=Stewart |first=Kordell |date=2021-02-04 |title="You Know What I Heard About Kordell Stewart???" |url=https://www.theplayerstribune.com/posts/kordell-stewart-nfl-football-pittsburgh-steelers |access-date=2021-11-04 |website=The Players' Tribune |language=en-US}}</ref>

He opened up about his experiences with Pittsburgh in a piece published by ''[[The Players' Tribune]]''.<ref name="Kordell Player" /> Following the essay's publication, numerous journalists, including Ron Cook of 
the ''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]'', expressed sympathy for Stewart and also confirmed witnessing the racism and homophobia displayed toward him during his tenure with the Steelers.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Cook |first=Ron |date=2021-02-05 |title=Ron Cook: Kordell Stewart deserved better during his time with Steelers |url=https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/ron-cook/2021/02/05/pittsburgh-steelers-kordell-stewart-players-tribune-slash-ron-cook/stories/202102070067 |access-date=2021-11-04 |website=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette |language=en}}</ref>

=== Donovan McNabb ===
In 2003, conservative radio talk show host [[Rush Limbaugh]] claimed that the media was biased in favor of [[Donovan McNabb]], a prominent black quarterback at the time. Limbaugh stated that "the media has been very desirous that a black quarterback do well… he got a lot of credit for the performance of this team that he really didn't deserve."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/nfl/news/story?id=1627887|title=McNabb's performance: A Rush to judgment?|date=2003-10-01|website=ESPN.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-23}}</ref> In a study of news coverage of white and black quarterbacks, political scientist David Niven of [[Florida Atlantic University]] disputed Limbaugh's claim, and found that black quarterbacks, including McNabb, did not receive preferential treatment by the media, yet neither did white quarterbacks, noting there were "minor" and "inconsistent" differences.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Niven|first=David|date=2005|title=Race, Quarterbacks, and the Media: Testing the Rush Limbaugh Hypothesis|journal=Journal of Black Studies|volume=35|issue=5|pages=684–694|jstor=40034343|doi=10.1177/0021934704266083|s2cid=141115237}}</ref>

=== Tyrod Taylor ===
[[File:Tyrod Taylor against the Texans.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Tyrod Taylor pictured in a 2016 game]]
In a 2017 interview published by ''[[The Buffalo News]]'', then-[[Buffalo Bills]] quarterback [[Tyrod Taylor]] stated that he always knew he would be criticized more than his white counterparts, a sentiment also echoed by Michael Vick and Cam Newton, but that it drives him to be a better player.<ref name="Tyrod debate ESPN" /><ref name="TT unfiltered BN">{{cite news | url=https://buffalonews.com/2017/10/14/tyrod-taylor-unfiltered-win-everythings-great-lose-want-crucify/ | title=Tyrod Taylor unfiltered: 'When we win, everything's great.

=== Deshaun Watson ===
Despite his ability to both pass and run effectively, [[Cleveland Browns]] signal-caller [[Deshaun Watson]] prefers not to be called a [[dual-threat quarterback]] as he believes the term is often used to stereotype black quarterbacks.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/2017/01/08/alabama-jalen-hurts-clemson-deshaun-watson-dual-threat-qb/96322194/|title=Deshaun Watson, Jalen Hurts see 'dual-threat QB' in different light|publisher = USA Today|date = January 8, 2017|access-date = August 24, 2018}}</ref> In 2018, Watson, then playing for the [[Houston Texans]], was the subject of racist remarks echoing these stereotypes after making a bad decision in a game. The superintendent of the [[Onalaska school district]] outside of Houston, Lynn Redden, came under fire and later resigned for saying that “when you need precision decision making you can't count on a black quarterback."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/Onalaska-ISD-superintendent-apologizes-for-13236285.php|title=Superintendent apologizes for comment about black quarterbacks|date=2018-09-17|work=Houston Chronicle|access-date=2018-10-23}}</ref>

===Lamar Jackson===
Despite a prolific college career as [[Louisville Cardinals football|Louisville]]'s quarterback, [[Lamar Jackson]] received suggestions to switch to receiver by pundits including [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] [[general manager]] [[Bill Polian]] due to his athleticism. Jackson adamantly fought off the notion leading up to the [[2018 NFL Draft]], even refusing to run drills such as the [[40-yard dash]] at the [[NFL Scouting Combine]] in order to focus on displaying his passing skills.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/columnist/bell/2018/03/02/insulting-louisville-quarterback-lamar-jackson-switch-wide-receiver/391256002/ | title=It's insulting to suggest Louisville quarterback Lamar Jackson should switch to wide receiver | publisher=USA Today Sports | date=2 March 2018 | access-date=27 December 2018 | author=Bell, Jarrett}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.sun-sentinel.com/sports/fl-sp-lamar-jackson-nfl-draft-20180424-story.html |title=Former Boynton Beach quarterback Lamar Jackson out to silence NFL doubters |last=Richardson |first=Shandel |work=Sun-Sentinel.com |access-date=2018-10-29 |language=en-US}}</ref> During Jackson's 2019 season as starting quarterback for the [[Baltimore Ravens]], in which he won the MVP award, Polian recanted his previous statement, saying he was wrong for suggesting a positional switch for Jackson.<ref>{{cite news |author=Bell, Jarrett |title=Bill Polian: 'I was wrong' for saying Lamar Jackson should be a wide receiver or running back in NFL |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/ravens/2019/11/06/lamar-jackson-bill-polian-wide-receiver-nfl-draft-ravens/4169975002/ |website=USAToday.com |date=November 6, 2019 |access-date=December 28, 2019}}</ref> At one point, Jackson was quoted as saying about his own performance, "not bad for a running back."<ref>{{Cite web |date=2019-09-08 |title=Lamar Jackson destroys his critics: 'Not bad for a running back.' |url=https://ftw.usatoday.com/2019/09/lamar-jackson-destroys-critics-running-back-quote |access-date=2020-12-20 |website=For The Win |language=en-US}}</ref>

===Kyler Murray===
Before the [[Arizona Cardinals]]' [[2022 Arizona Cardinals season|2022 season]], quarterback [[Kyler Murray]] engaged in a lengthy contract dispute with the Cardinals.<ref>{{cite web|title=Kyler Murray rejoins Cardinals for OTAs amid contract dispute|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/cardinals/2022/06/01/kyler-murray-rejoins-arizona-cardinals-otas/7471360001/|website=USA Today|access-date=8 July 2023 |date=1 June 2022}}</ref> Eventually, Murray and the Cardinals agreed to a 5-year, $230.5 million extension in July, but the new contract contained a film study clause that required Murray to study film for four hours a week. Several observers intensely criticized the Cardinals organization for the inclusion of the clause, including Hall of Fame quarterback [[Warren Moon]], who perceived the clause as stereotypical towards black quarterbacks. Specifically, Moon elaborated that "it's something we were always accused of back in the day when they didn't let us (black quarterbacks) play...that we were lazy, that we didn't study, that we couldn't be leaders, that we weren't smart. So all those different things just kind of came to surface after we put all that stuff to bed over the years and just because of this deal that's going on between Arizona and Kyler." In response to the criticism, the team removed the clause a week later.<ref>{{cite web|title=Warren Moon calls Kyler Murray's film study clause a 'slap in the face' to Black quarterbacks|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/cards/2022/07/31/kyler-murray-cardinals-contract-clause-slap-face-warren-moon/10196869002/ |website=USA Today|access-date=7 July 2023 |date=31 July 2022}}</ref>
