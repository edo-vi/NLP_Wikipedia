'''Morgan Ciprès''' (born 24 April 1991) is a French former competitive [[pair skater]]. With partner [[Vanessa James]], born in Scarborough, Ontario, Canada, he is the [[2019 European Figure Skating Championships|2019 European Champion]], the [[2018 World Figure Skating Championships|2018 World]] bronze medalist, the [[2017 European Figure Skating Championships|2017 European]] bronze medalist, the [[2018–19 Grand Prix of Figure Skating Final|2018 Grand Prix Final]] champion and a six-time [[French Figure Skating Championships|French national]] champion. They have also won medals in [[ISU Grand Prix of Figure Skating|Grand Prix]] and [[ISU Challenger Series|Challenger Series]] competitions.  James and Ciprès represented France at the [[2014 Winter Olympics|2014]] and [[2018 Winter Olympics]].

== Early career ==
Born in Melun, France in 1991, Ciprès began learning to skate in 1995.<ref name=ISU-1617/> He initially competed in [[single skating]], debuting on the [[ISU Junior Grand Prix]] in 2004. An adductor muscle injury caused him to miss the 2007–08 season.<ref name=ISU-0910/> He placed 13th at the [[2010 World Junior Figure Skating Championships|2010 World Junior Championships]].

== Pair skating career ==
In September 2010, Ciprès teamed up with Canadian/American [[Vanessa James]] to compete in [[pair skating]] for France.<ref name=ISU-1112/><ref name=LP111118/> They made no competitive appearances in their first season as Ciprès learned pairs elements.<ref name=masters/>  Eight years later, James recalled the beginning of her partnership:  "I remember our 3-day-trial and it was so fun. He was so funny, because he had never done pairs before, so he was really nervous and saying 'oh my gosh, oh my gosh' every time he threw me. I knew that we were going to be good friends."<ref name=GS180323/>

=== 2011–2012 season ===
James/Ciprès made their competitive debut in late September 2011, finishing fifth at the [[2011 Ondrej Nepela Memorial]]. After placing fifth at the [[2011 Coupe de Nice]], the pair finished eighth at their first Grand Prix together, the [[2011 Trophee Eric Bompard]]. At the [[2012 French Figure Skating Championships|2012 French Championships]], they ranked first in the short program and second in the free skate. With a total score 8.92 points lower than [[Daria Popova]] / [[Bruno Massot]], James/Ciprès received the silver medal.

Finishing sixth overall, James/Ciprès were the best French pair (outscoring Popova/Massot by almost 12 points) at the [[2012 European Figure Skating Championships|2012 European Championships]] in [[Sheffield]], England. They were granted France's lone spot in pairs at the [[2012 World Figure Skating Championships|2012 World Championships]] in [[Nice]], France. In Nice, the two qualified to the final segment and finished sixteenth overall.

=== 2012–2013 season ===
James/Ciprès won the bronze medal at the [[2012 Nebelhorn Trophy]]&nbsp;— it was their first international medal as a pair.<ref name=GS120930/> Their 2012 Grand Prix assignments were [[2012 Skate America|Skate America]], where they placed fourth, and the [[2012 Trophee Eric Bompard|Trophee Eric Bompard]], where they came in sixth. James/Ciprès won another international medal at the [[2012 NRW Trophy]] and followed that in December with their first French national title.

In January, James/Ciprès came in fourth at the [[2013 European Figure Skating Championships|2013 European Championships]] in [[Zagreb]], Croatia. After taking gold at the [[2013 International Challenge Cup]], they placed eighth at the [[2013 World Figure Skating Championships|2013 World Championships]] in [[London, Ontario]]. Due to their result in Canada, they [[Figure skating at the 2014 Winter Olympics – Qualification|qualified]] a spot for France in the pairs' event at the 2014 Winter Olympics in [[Sochi]], Russia.

=== 2013–2014 season: Sochi Olympics ===
James/Ciprès were again assigned to [[2013 Skate America|Skate America]] and the [[2013 Trophee Eric Bompard|Trophee Eric Bompard]]. After Ciprès underwent surgery to correct a wrist injury, he had to avoid lifts for a period, causing the pair to withdraw from Skate America.<ref name=FFSG130930/><ref name=IN131112/> They were able to compete at the Trophee Eric Bompard and placed fifth. The pair  successfully defended their national title, winning in 2013.

At the [[2014 European Figure Skating Championships|2014 Europeans]], James/Ciprès set personal best scores in both segments of the competition and came in fifth. They were named to the French team to the [[Figure skating at the 2014 Winter Olympics|2014 Winter Olympics]] in [[Sochi]]. There they placed tenth in the pairs event and sixth in the team event.

=== 2014–2015 season ===
James/Ciprès finished fourth at the [[2014 CS Nebelhorn Trophy]] and fifth at both of their Grand Prix assignments, the [[2014 Skate Canada International]] and [[2014 Trophée Éric Bompard]]. They placed fifth at the [[2015 European Figure Skating Championships|2015 European Championships]] in [[Stockholm]] and ninth at the [[2015 World Figure Skating Championships|2015 World Championships]] in [[Shanghai]].

=== 2015–2016 season: First Grand Prix medal ===
James/Ciprès began their season with a bronze medal at the [[2015 CS Nebelhorn Trophy]]. They placed second in the short program at the [[2015 Trophée Éric Bompard]]. The remainder of the event was cancelled following the [[November 2015 Paris attacks]] by terrorists. The ISU deemed those placements to be the final results, and awarded James/Ciprès silver as their first Grand Prix medal. The pair finished fourth at the [[2016 European Figure Skating Championships|2016 European Championships]] in [[Bratislava]] and tenth at the [[2016 World Figure Skating Championships|2016 World Championships]] in [[Boston]]. At the end of the season, they concluded that they needed a major change if they were to continue competing.<ref name=GS170526/>  James said "either we improve, or we stop. There was no point in anything else."<ref name=NBC181206/>

=== 2016–2017 season: European bronze medal ===
In June 2016, James/Ciprès relocated to [[Coral Springs, Florida]], to be coached by [[John Zimmerman (figure skater)|John Zimmerman]] and [[Jeremy Barrett (figure skater)|Jeremy Barrett]], both former competitive skaters.<ref name=IN170125/><ref name=Smith170127/><ref name=ISU-1617/> After taking silver at the [[2016 CS Autumn Classic International]], the pair competed at two [[2016–17 ISU Grand Prix of Figure Skating|Grand Prix]] events; they finished fourth at the [[2016 Skate America]] and won the bronze medal at the [[2016 Trophée de France]].

In January 2017, James/Ciprès won the bronze medal at the [[2017 European Figure Skating Championships|European Championships]] in [[Ostrava]], Czech Republic.<ref name=Lequipe170127/><ref name=AS170206/> They were the first French pair in fourteen years to medal at the event.<ref name=IN170126/> (In [[2003 European Figure Skating Championships|2003]], [[Sarah Abitbol]] / [[Stéphane Bernadis]] took silver).

In March, James/Ciprès placed tenth in the short program, sixth in the free skate, and eighth overall at the [[2017 World Figure Skating Championships|2017 World Championships]] in [[Helsinki]], Finland. The following month, they competed as part of Team France at the [[2017 ISU World Team Trophy in Figure Skating|2017 World Team Trophy]] in [[Tokyo]], Japan. While the French team finished sixth overall, the pair scored personal bests and placed first in both segments of the pairs' event, ahead of Russia's [[Evgenia Tarasova]] / [[Vladimir Morozov (figure skater)|Vladimir Morozov]].

Reflecting on their progress as a team, James said, "Our main problem [before] was that we were two different people on the ice. We needed to change that and to increase the connection between the two of us."<ref name=IN171118/>

=== 2017–2018 season: PyeongChang Olympics and World bronze medal ===
James/Ciprès began their season with gold at the [[2017 CS Autumn Classic International]]. They won medals at both of their Grand Prix assignments, taking bronze at the [[2017 Skate Canada International]] and silver at the [[2017 Internationaux de France]]. They finished as the first alternates for the [[2017–18 Grand Prix of Figure Skating Final|Grand Prix Final]]. At the [[2018 European Figure Skating Championships|2018 European Championships]] in [[Moscow]], the pair placed first in the short program, fourth in the free skate, and fourth overall — 0.01 shy of the podium. They received a small gold medal for their short program.

James/Ciprès were named to France's delegation to the [[2018 Winter Olympics]], which took place in February in [[Pyeongchang]], South Korea.<ref name=Oly2018/> During the [[Figure skating at the 2018 Winter Olympics – Team event|team event]], they placed sixth in their segment and Team France finished tenth. In the regular [[Figure skating at the 2018 Winter Olympics – Pairs skating|pairs event]], they placed sixth in the short, fifth in the free, and fifth overall. In March, they became the first French pair since [[2000 World Figure Skating Championships|2000]] to stand on the World podium, winning the bronze medal at the [[2018 World Figure Skating Championships|2018 World Championships]] in [[Milan]], Italy.  James, reflecting on the start of her partnership, remarked "I'm so glad I made that choice because we're a really good team today. It's been bumpy, but amazing with Morgan."<ref name=GS180323/>

=== 2018–2019 season ===
The duo's programs were both choreographed by ice dancers. [[Charlie White (figure skater)|Charlie White]], a retired Olympic gold medalist, worked on the free skate, and fellow French Olympian [[Guillaume Cizeron]] developed the short programme.<ref name=NBC181206/>

James/Ciprès won gold at their first event of the season, the [[2018 CS Autumn Classic International]] and obtained their first victory at a Grand Prix event, at [[2018 Skate Canada International]], setting a new world record in the free skate.  James said that they "gave so much emotion, and at the end, it was just magic for us."<ref name=GS181027/>  In mid-November they competed at the [[2018 Internationaux de France]], where they won their second Grand Prix gold medal of the season, albeit with a somewhat rockier performance in the short program. They ranked third before winning the free skate.  These results qualified them for their first [[2018–2019 Grand Prix of Figure Skating Final|Grand Prix Final]], for 2018–19.

Ciprès said "it's the first time for us to win two Grand Prix in the season and to go to the Grand Prix Final. We have a lot of work to do for these next two weeks."<ref name=GS181124/>  In fourth after the short program in the Final, they again set a world record to win the free skate and the gold medal.  James expressed the hope that "having this long program so solid and strong will just help when we have a good short program. I know we have to fight every time after our short program to make up the points, but feeling more free and not having to try and try to make a comeback, I think will just liberate us a little bit more, I am hoping."<ref name=GS181209/>

After winning another national title, their sixth, James/Ciprès competed at the [[2019 European Figure Skating Championships|2019 European Championships]] in [[Minsk]]. After a first-place finish in the short program, they were ahead of Tarasova/Morozov.<ref name=GS190123/>  They won the free skate as well, taking the European pairs title. They were only the second French team to do so, and the first since [[1932 European Figure Skating Championships|1932]], when [[Andrée Joly]] and [[Pierre Brunet (figure skater)|Pierre Brunet]] won it.  James called the result "a dream come true", saying that it was "a dream when we were children to be here one day."<ref name=GS190124/>

In March at the [[2019 World Figure Skating Championships|2019 World Championships]] in [[Saitama (city)|Saitama]], during the short program warm-up, James had a collision with Italy's [[Matteo Guarise]], in which both skaters fell onto the ice.<ref name=ES190320/> James/Ciprès placed a very unexpected seventh in the short program after additional mishaps. James fell on her throw triple flip, and Ciprès doubled his planned triple toe loop. In the free program they placed third, and fifth overall. They did not make the 'top of podium' for the first time that season, but took a small bronze medal for the free program. At the end of their free program, James/Ciprès announced that they would continue to keep skating until they won the World title.<ref name=ISUT190320/> To finish the season, they competed at the [[2019 ISU World Team Trophy in Figure Skating|2019 World Team Trophy]] in [[Fukuoka]], Japan. They earned a new personal best in the free skate to earn first in the pairs event and fourth overall with the French team.<ref name=GS190507/>

Following the 2018–19 season, James/Ciprès were initially given two assignments on the [[2019-20 ISU Grand Prix of Figure Skating|2019–20 Grand Prix circuit]], the [[2019 NHK Trophy]] and [[2019 Internationaux de France]].  At the same time, it was announced that James would be appearing on the revival of the Canadian [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] skating competition program ''[[Battle of the Blades]]'' in the fall of 2019, partnered with retired [[NHL]] player [[Brian McGrattan]]. James/Ciprès subsequently withdrew from their Grand Prix assignments, concluding they could not practically do both.<ref name=CBC190924/>

===Sexual abuse allegations, and retirement===

On 10 December 2019, ''[[USA Today]]'' journalist [[Christine Brennan]] reported that Ciprès was under investigation by the [[United States Center for SafeSport]], which investigates sexual abuse in Olympic sports, for [[Sexting|having sent a picture of his penis]] to a 13-year-old girl who was a student at their training center. She reported that coaches Zimmerman and Silvia Fontana were accused of having known about this and attempted to cover it up in the runup to the 2018 Olympics.<ref name=USAT-191210/> Zimmerman — who coached the 13-year-old as well as Cipres — was suspended by SafeSport in March 2021 for covering up the 2017 abuse, and for shaming and threatening the girl after he found out about the incident.<ref name="auto">{{cite web| url = https://www.cbc.ca/sports/olympics/winter/figureskating/vanessa-james-unaware-of-abuse-allegations-former-partner-morgan-cipres-1.6220285| title = Canadian figure skater says she was unaware of abuse allegations against former partner {{!}} CBC Sports}}</ref>

James/Ciprès did not compete again during the remainder of the season. The allegations against Ciprès subsequently factored into the scandals that forced the resignation of controversial [[French Federation of Ice Sports|FFSG]] chief [[Didier Gailhaguet]] in the spring of 2020.<ref name=EN200208/><ref name=USAT-191210/> In July 2020, the FFSG's disciplinary committee declined to take action against Ciprès, claiming that it was not aware of the alleged victim's complaint, and that there was a lack of "objective [elements] (photographs, messages, letters) that could establish proof of any offense."<ref name=YS-200722/>

On 25 September 2020, it was announced that James would return to ''Battle of the Blades'' for its sixth season, this time partnered with [[Akim Aliu]].<ref name=CBC200925/> Four days later, the FFSG announced that James and Ciprès would both be retiring from competition.<ref name=USAT-200929/>

On 8 December 2020, the Florida [[state attorney]]'s office filed a third-degree [[felony]] charge against Ciprès for the transmission of material harmful to a minor by electronic device, which carries up to a five-year prison sentence, and issued a warrant for his arrest.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2021/03/09/former-olympic-skater-suspended-after-accusation-sex-abuse-cover-up/4635608001/|title=Former Olympic skater John Zimmerman suspended following accusation of sex abuse cover-up|first=Christine|last=Brennan|website=USA Today}}</ref><ref name=USAT-201208/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2020/12/08/sexual-abuse-french-figure-skater-morgan-cipres-charged-florida/6490137002/|title=French figure skater charged in Florida following sexual abuse allegations|first=Christine|last=Brennan|website=USA Today}}</ref> The investigation had been reopened in June; the U.S. SafeSport investigation remains ongoing.<ref name=USAT-200630/>

James announced in April 2021 that she was coming out of retirement.<ref name="auto"/> She has partnered with Canadian pairs skater Eric Radford.
