== Definitions ==
Definitions of literature have varied over time.<ref name="Leitch ''et al.'', ''The Norton Anthology of Theory and Criticism'', 28">Leitch ''et al.'', ''The Norton Anthology of Theory and Criticism'', 28</ref> In [[Western Europe]], prior to the 18th century, literature denoted all books and writing. Literature can be seen as returning to older, more inclusive notions, so that [[cultural studies]], for instance, include, in addition to [[Western canon|canonical works]], [[Genre fiction|popular and minority genres]]. The word is also used in reference to non-written works: to "[[oral literature]]" and "the literature of [[preliterate]] culture".

A [[value judgment]] definition of literature considers it as consisting solely of high quality writing that forms part of the ''[[belles-lettres]]'' ("fine writing") tradition.{{sfn|Eagleton|2008|p=9}} An example of this is in the [[Encyclopedia Britannica Eleventh Edition|1910–1911 ''Encyclopædia Britannica'']], which classified literature as "the best expression of the best thought reduced to writing".<ref name="Biswas, ''Critique of Poetics'', 538">Biswas, ''Critique of Poetics'', 538</ref>

The Judeo-Christian Bible reveals its oral traditional roots; medieval European manuscripts are penned by performing scribes; geometric vases from archaic Greece mirror Homer's oral style. (...) Indeed, if these final decades of the millennium have taught us anything, it must be that oral tradition never was the other we accused it of being; it never was the primitive, preliminary technology of communication we thought it to be.

Controversial, religious, political and instructional literature proliferated during the European [[Renaissance]] as a result of the [[Johannes Gutenberg]]'s invention of the [[printing press]]<ref>Elizabeth L.

=== Publishing ===
[[File:Jingangjing.jpg|thumb|The intricate frontispiece of the [[Diamond Sutra]] from [[Tang dynasty]] China, the world's earliest dated printed book, AD 868 ([[British Library]])]]
Publishing became possible with the [[history of writing|invention of writing]] but became more practical with the [[History of printing|invention of printing]]. Prior to printing, distributed works were copied manually, by [[scribe]]s.

The Chinese inventor [[Bi Sheng]] made [[movable type]] of earthenware c.1045. In c.1450, [[Johannes Gutenberg]] independently invented movable type in Europe. This invention gradually made books less expensive to produce and more widely available.

Early printed books, single sheets, and images created before 1501 in Europe are known as [[incunable]]s or ''incunabula''. "A man born in 1453, the year of the fall of Constantinople, could look back from his fiftieth year on a lifetime in which about eight million books had been printed, more perhaps than all the scribes of Europe had produced since Constantine founded his city in A.D. 330."<ref>[[Michael Clapham (industrialist)|Clapham, Michael]], "Printing" in ''A History of Technology'', Vol 2. ''From the Renaissance to the Industrial Revolution'', edd. Charles Singer ''et al.'' (Oxford 1957), p. 377. Cited from [[Elizabeth L. Eisenstein]], ''The Printing Press as an Agent of Change'' (Cambridge University, 1980).</ref>

Eventually, printing enabled other forms of publishing besides books. The [[history of newspaper publishing]] began in Germany in 1609, with the [[magazine#History|publishing of magazines]] following in 1663.

In England in the late 1820s, growing political and social awareness, "particularly among the [[utilitarians]] and [[Jeremy Bentham|Bentham]]ites, promoted the possibility of including courses in English literary study in the newly formed [[London University]]".

The [[King James Version]] of the Bible has been called "the most influential version of the most influential book in the world, in what is now its most influential language", "the most important book in English religion and culture", and "the most celebrated book in the [[English-speaking world]]"{{citation needed|date=February 2022}} - principally because of its literary style and widespread distribution. Prominent [[Atheism|atheist]] figures such as the late [[Christopher Hitchens]] and [[Richard Dawkins]] have praised the King James Version as being "a giant step in the maturing of English literature" and "a great work of literature", respectively, with Dawkins then adding, "A native speaker of English who has never read a word of the King James Bible is verging on the barbarian".<ref>{{cite magazine|url= https://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2011/05/hitchens-201105?currentPage=all|title= When the King Saved God|year= 2011|magazine= [[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]|access-date= 10 August 2017|archive-date= 24 December 2020|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20201224153506/https://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2011/05/hitchens-201105?currentPage=all|url-status= live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/may/19/richard-dawkins-king-james-bible|title= Why I want all our children to read the King James Bible|date= 20 May 2012|newspaper= [[The Guardian]]|access-date= 10 August 2017|archive-date= 29 November 2020|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20201129234923/https://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/may/19/richard-dawkins-king-james-bible|url-status= live}}</ref>

Societies in which [[preaching]] has great importance, and those in which religious structures and [[clergy|authorities]] have a near-monopoly of [[literacy|reading and writing]] and/or a censorship role, may impart a religious gloss to much of the literature those societies produce or retain - as for example in the [[European Middle Ages]]. The traditions of [[textual criticism|close study]] of religious texts has furthered the development of techniques and theories in [[literary studies]].

==Types==

=== Poetry ===

[[File:Calligramme.jpg|thumb|left|A [[calligram]] by [[Guillaume Apollinaire]]. These are a type of poem in which the written words are arranged in such a way to produce a visual image.]]

[[Poetry]] has traditionally been distinguished from [[prose]] by its greater use of the [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]] qualities of language, including [[music]]al devices such as [[assonance]], [[alliteration]], [[rhyme]], and [[rhythm]], and by being set in [[Line (poetry)|lines]] and [[Verse (poetry)|verses]] rather than paragraphs, and more recently its use of other [[Typography|typographical]] elements.<ref name=oedpoetry>{{cite web|title=poetry, n.|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/146552|work=Oxford English Dictionary|publisher=OUP|access-date=13 February 2014|archive-date=30 June 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200630003156/https://www.oed.com/view/Entry/146552|url-status=live}}{{subscription required}}</ref>{{sfn|Preminger|1993|p=938}}{{sfn|Preminger|1993|p=939}} This distinction is complicated by various hybrid forms such as [[digital poetry]], [[sound poetry]], [[concrete poetry]] and [[prose poem]],{{sfn|Preminger|1993|p=981}} and more generally by the fact that prose possesses rhythm.{{sfn|Preminger|1993|p=979}} Abram Lipsky refers to it as an "open secret" that "prose is not distinguished from poetry by lack of rhythm".<ref name=lipsky>{{cite journal|last=Lipsky|first=Abram|title=Rhythm in Prose|journal=The Sewanee Review|year=1908|volume=16|issue=3|pages=277–289|jstor=27530906}} {{subscription required}}</ref> 

Prior to the 19th century, poetry was commonly understood to be something set in metrical lines: "any kind of subject consisting of {{sic|hide=y|Rhythm}} or Verses".<ref name=oedpoetry /> Possibly as a result of [[Aristotle]]'s influence (his ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]''), "poetry" before the 19th century was usually less a technical designation for verse than a normative category of fictive or rhetorical art.{{clarify|date=October 2020}}<ref name="Ross, The Emergence of Literature: Making and Reading the English Canon in the Eighteenth Century, 398">Ross, "The Emergence of 'Literature': Making and Reading the English Canon in the Eighteenth Century", 398</ref> As a form it may pre-date [[literacy]], with the earliest works being composed within and sustained by an oral tradition;<ref>{{cite book|last=Finnegan|first=Ruth H.|title=Oral poetry: its nature, significance, and social context|year=1977|publisher=Indiana University Press|page=66}}</ref><ref name=magoun>{{cite journal|last=Magoun|first=Francis P.

=== Prose ===
As noted above, [[prose]] generally makes far less use of the aesthetic qualities of language than poetry.{{sfn|Preminger|1993|p=938}}{{sfn|Preminger|1993|p=939}}<ref>{{cite web|title=Glossary: P|url=http://www.wwnorton.com/college/english/litweb10/glossary/P.aspx|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110318074151/http://www.wwnorton.com/college/english/litweb10/glossary/P.aspx|url-status=dead|archive-date=18 March 2011|work=LitWeb, the Norton Introduction to Literature Studyspace|access-date=15 February 2014|author=Alison Booth|author2=Kelly J. Mays }}</ref> However, developments in modern literature, including [[free verse]] and [[prose poetry]] have tended to blur the differences, and American poet [[T.S. Eliot]] suggested that while: "the distinction between [[Verse (poetry)|verse]] and prose is clear, the distinction between [[poetry]] and prose is obscure".<ref>Eliot T.S. 'Poetry & Prose: The Chapbook. Poetry Bookshop: London, 1921.</ref> There are [[verse novel]]s, a type of narrative poetry in which a novel-length narrative is told through the medium of poetry rather than prose. ''[[Eugene Onegin]]'' (1831) by [[Alexander Pushkin]] is the most famous example.<ref>For discussion of the basic categorical issues see {{harv|Preminger|1993|loc="Narrative Poetry"}}.</ref>

On the historical development of prose, Richard Graff notes that "[In the case of [[ancient Greece]]] recent scholarship has emphasized the fact that formal prose was a comparatively late development, an "invention" properly associated with the [[Classical antiquity|classical period]]".<ref name=graff>{{cite journal|last=Graff|first=Richard|title=Prose versus Poetry in Early Greek Theories of Style|journal=Rhetorica|year=2005|volume=23|issue=4|pages=303–335|jstor=10.1525/rh.2005.23.4.303|doi=10.1525/rh.2005.23.4.303|s2cid=144730853 }} {{subscription required}}</ref>

[[Latin]] was a major influence on the development of prose in many European countries. Especially important was the great Roman orator [[Cicero]].<ref>"Literature", ''Encyclopaedia Britannica''. online</ref> It was the ''[[lingua franca]]'' among literate Europeans until quite recent times, and the great works of [[Descartes]] (1596 – 1650), [[Francis Bacon]] (1561 – 1626), and [[Baruch Spinoza]] (1632 – 1677) were published in Latin. Among the last important books written primarily in Latin prose were the works of [[Emanuel Swedenborg|Swedenborg]] (d. 1772), [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]] (d. 1778), [[Leonhard Euler|Euler]] (d. 1783), [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]] (d. 1855), and [[Isaac Newton]] (d. 1727).

====Novel====
[[File:Printing3 Walk of Ideas Berlin.JPG|thumb|Sculpture in [[Berlin]] depicting a stack of books on which are inscribed the names of great German writers]]
{{See also|Genre fiction|Hypertext fiction}}

A novel is a long [[fictional]] prose narrative. In English, the term emerged from the [[Romance language]]s in the late 15th century, with the meaning of "news"; it came to indicate something new, without a distinction between fact or fiction.<ref name=sommerville>{{cite book|last=Sommerville|first=C. J.|year=1996|title=The News Revolution in England: Cultural Dynamics of Daily Information|location=Oxford|publisher=OUP|page=18}}</ref> The romance is a closely related long prose narrative. [[Walter Scott]] defined it as "a fictitious narrative in prose or verse; the interest of which turns upon marvelous and uncommon incidents", whereas in the novel "the events are accommodated to the ordinary train of human events and the modern state of society".<ref>"Essay on Romance", ''Prose Works'' volume vi, p.&nbsp;129, quoted in "Introduction" to Walter Scott's ''Quentin Durward'', ed. Susan Maning. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1992, p.&nbsp;xxv. Romance should not be confused with [[Harlequin Romance]].</ref> Other European languages do not distinguish between romance and novel: "a novel is ''le roman'', ''der Roman'', ''il romanzo''",<ref name="Doody 1996, p. 15">Doody (1996), p.&nbsp;15.</ref> indicates the proximity of the forms.<ref name=brooklyn>{{cite web|title=The Novel|url=http://academic.brooklyn.cuny.edu/english/melani/cs6/novel.html|work=A Guide to the Study of Literature: A Companion Text for Core Studies 6, Landmarks of Literature|publisher=[[Brooklyn College]]|access-date=22 February 2014|archive-date=22 February 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222161435/http://academic.brooklyn.cuny.edu/english/melani/cs6/novel.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

Although there are many historical prototypes, so-called "novels before the novel",{{sfn|Goody|2006|p=19}} the modern novel form emerges late in cultural history—roughly during the eighteenth century.{{sfn|Goody|2006|p=20}} Initially subject to much criticism, the novel has acquired a dominant position amongst literary forms, both popularly and critically.<ref name=brooklyn />{{sfn|Goody|2006|p=29}}<ref>{{cite book|title=The Novel, Volume 2: Forms and Themes|year=2006|publisher=Princeton UP|location=Princeton|isbn=978-0-691-04948-9|page=31|editor=Franco Moretti|chapter=The Novel in Search of Itself: A Historical Morphology}}</ref>

====Novella====

The publisher [[Melville House Publishing|Melville House]] classifies the [[novella]] as "too short to be a novel, too long to be a short story".<ref name=antrim>{{Cite news|last=Antrim|first=Taylor|title=In Praise of Short|journal=The Daily Beast|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2010/08/04/the-novella-is-making-a-comeback.html|access-date=15 February 2014|year=2010|archive-date=18 February 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140218182635/http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2010/08/04/the-novella-is-making-a-comeback.html|url-status=live}}</ref> Publishers and literary award societies typically consider a novella to be between 17,000 and 40,000 words.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sfwa.org/awards/faq.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090319043837/http://sfwa.org/awards/faq.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=2009-03-19|title=What's the definition of a "novella," "novelette," etc.?|website=[[Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America]]}}</ref>

====Short story====

A dilemma in defining the "[[short story]]" as a literary form is how to, or whether one should, distinguish it from any short narrative and its contested origin,<ref name=boyd>{{cite web|last=Boyd|first=William|title=A short history of the short story|url=http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/magazine/william-boyd-short-history-of-the-short-story/#.Uxr1EoVVO-c|publisher=Prospect Magazine|access-date=8 March 2014|archive-date=3 July 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140703204216/https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/magazine/william-boyd-short-history-of-the-short-story/#.Uxr1EoVVO-c|url-status=live}}</ref> that include the [[Bible]], and [[Edgar Allan Poe]].<ref name=colibaba>{{cite journal|last=Colibaba|first=Ştefan|title=The Nature of the Short Story: Attempts at Definition|journal=Synergy|year=2010|volume=6|issue=2|pages=220–230|url=http://synergy.ase.ro/issues/2010-vol6-no2/14-the-nature-of-the-short-story-attempts-at-definition.pdf|access-date=6 March 2014|archive-date=21 March 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140321144131/http://synergy.ase.ro/issues/2010-vol6-no2/14-the-nature-of-the-short-story-attempts-at-definition.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref>

Nonfiction can fall within the broad category of literature as "any collection of written work", but some works fall within the narrower definition "by virtue of the excellence of their writing, their originality and their general aesthetic and artistic merits".{{sfn|Cuddon|1998|p=472}}

=== Drama ===
[[File:Libretto Cover Andrea Chenier.jpg|left|thumb|Cover of a 1921 libretto for [[Umberto Giordano|Giordano]]'s opera ''[[Andrea Chénier]]'']]
[[Drama]] is literature intended for [[performance]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Elam|first1=Kier|title=The Semiotics of Theatre and Drama|url=https://archive.org/details/semioticsoftheat0000elam|url-access=registration|date=1980|publisher=Methuen|location=London and New York|isbn=978-0-416-72060-0|page=[https://archive.org/details/semioticsoftheat0000elam/page/98 98]}}</ref> The form is combined with music and dance in [[opera]] and [[musical theatre]] (see [[libretto]]). A [[Play (theatre)|play]] is a written dramatic work by a [[playwright]] that is intended for performance in a theatre; it comprises chiefly [[dialogue]] between [[character (arts)|character]]s. A [[closet drama]], by contrast, is written to be read rather than to be performed; the meaning of which can be realized fully on the page.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Cody|first1=Gabrielle H.|title=The Columbia Encyclopedia of Modern Drama|date=2007|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York City|page=271|edition=Volume 1}}</ref> Nearly all drama took verse form until comparatively recently.

The earliest form of which there exists substantial knowledge is [[Greek theatre|Greek drama]]. This developed as a performance associated with [[religion|religious]] and civic [[festival]]s, typically enacting or developing upon well-known [[history|historical]], or [[mythology|mythological]] themes,

In the twentieth century [[Screenplay|script]]s written for non-stage media have been added to this form, including [[radio drama|radio]], television and film.

Literary works have been protected by copyright law from unauthorized reproduction since at least 1710.<ref>The Statute of Anne 1710 and the Literary Copyright Act 1842 used the term "book". However, since 1911 the statutes have referred to literary works.</ref> Literary works are defined by copyright law to mean "any work, other than a dramatic or musical work, which is written, spoken or sung, and accordingly includes (a) a table or compilation (other than a database), (b) a computer program, (c) preparatory design material for a computer program, and (d) a database."<ref>{{Cite web |title=Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 |work=legislation.gov.uk |access-date=11 October 2021 |url=https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/48/part/I/chapter/I/crossheading/descriptions-of-work-and-related-provisions |archive-date=29 October 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211029171417/https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/48/part/I/chapter/I/crossheading/descriptions-of-work-and-related-provisions |url-status=live }}</ref>

Literary works are all works of literature; that is all works expressed in print or writing (other than dramatic or musical works).<ref>"University of London Press v. University Tutorial Press" [1916]</ref>

==== United States ====
The [[copyright law of the United States]] has a long and complicated history, dating back to colonial times. It was established as federal law with the Copyright Act of 1790. This act was updated many times, including a [[Copyright Act of 1976|major revision in 1976]].

==== European Union ====
The [[copyright law of the European Union]] is the copyright law applicable within the [[European Union]]. Copyright law is largely harmonized in the Union, although country to country differences exist. The body of law was implemented in the EU through a number of [[Directive (European Union)|directives]], which the member states need to enact into their national law. The main copyright directives are the [[Copyright Term Directive]], the [[Information Society Directive]] and the [[Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market]]. Copyright in the Union is furthermore dependent on international conventions to which the European Union is a member (such as the [[TRIPS Agreement]] and conventions to which all Member States are parties (such as the [[Berne Convention]])).

====Copyright in communist countries====

====Copyright in Japan====
[[Copyright in Japan|Japan]] was a party to the original [[Berne convention]] in 1899, so its copyright law is in sync with most international regulations. The convention protected copyrighted works for 50 years after the author's death (or 50 years after publication for unknown authors and corporations). However, in 2004 Japan extended the copyright term to 70 years for cinematographic works. At the end of 2018, as a result of the [[Trans-Pacific Partnership]] negotiations, the 70 year term was applied to all works.<ref name="Agency for Cultural Affairs Text">{{cite web |url=http://www.bunka.go.jp/seisaku/chosakuken/hokaisei/kantaiheiyo_hokaisei/pdf/r1408266_02.pdf |script-title=ja:環太平洋パートナーシップ協定の法律） |language=ja |author=Agency for Cultural Affairs |publisher=Agency for Cultural Affairs |access-date=2019-01-04 |archive-date=19 January 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210119052833/https://www.bunka.go.jp/seisaku/chosakuken/hokaisei/kantaiheiyo_hokaisei/pdf/r1408266_02.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref> This new term is not applied retroactively; works that had entered the public domain between 1999 and 2018 by expiration would remain in the public domain.

=== Censorship ===

Censorship of literature is employed by states, religious organizations, educational institutions, etc., to control what can be portrayed, spoken, performed, or written.{{sfn|Cuddon|1998|pp=118–122|loc="Censorship"}} Generally such bodies attempt to ban works for [[sedition|political reasons]], or because they deal with other controversial matters such as race, or [[obscenity|sex]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ala.org/bbooks/about|title=About Banned & Challenged Books|work=ala.org|date=25 October 2016|access-date=28 October 2020|archive-date=8 April 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140408084921/http://www.ala.org/bbooks/about|url-status=live}}</ref>

A notorious example of censorship is [[James Joyce]]'s novel [[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]], which has been described by Russian-American novelist [[Vladimir Nabokov]] as a "divine work of art" and the greatest masterpiece of 20th century prose.<ref>Nabokov, pp. 55, 57{{full citation needed|date=September 2022}}</ref> It was [[Obscenity trial of Ulysses in The Little Review|banned in the United States from 1921 until 1933]] on the grounds of obscenity. Nowadays it is a central literary text in English literature courses, throughout the world.<ref>''Ulysses'' has been called "the most prominent landmark in modernist literature", a work where life's complexities are depicted with "unprecedented, and unequalled, linguistic and stylistic virtuosity". ''The New York Times guide to essential knowledge'', 3d ed. (2011), p. 126.</ref>

== Awards ==

There are numerous [[Literary award|awards]] recognizing achievement and contribution in literature. Given the diversity of the field, awards are typically limited in scope, usually on: form, [[genre]], language, nationality and output (e.g. for first-time writers or [[debut novel]]s).<ref>{{Cite news|title=Man Booker 2013: Top 25 literary prizes|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/bookprizes/10139413/Man-Booker-2013-Top-25-literary-prizes.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131015075047/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/bookprizes/10139413/Man-Booker-2013-Top-25-literary-prizes.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=15 October 2013|publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group|The Telegraph]]|access-date=8 March 2014|author=John Stock|author2=Kealey Rigden |date=15 October 2013}}</ref>

The [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] was one of the six [[Nobel Prizes]] established by the will of [[Alfred Nobel]] in 1895,<ref name=nobelfacts>{{cite web|title=Facts on the Nobel Prize in Literature|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/facts/literature/index.html|work=Nobelprize.org|publisher=Nobel Media AB|access-date=8 March 2014|archive-date=8 March 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140308200013/http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/facts/literature/index.html|url-status=live}}</ref> and is awarded to an author on the basis of their body of work, rather than to, or for, a particular work itself.{{refn|group=note|However, in some instances a work has been cited in the explanation of why the award was given.}} Other literary prizes for which all nationalities are eligible include: the [[Neustadt International Prize for Literature]], the [[Man Booker International Prize]], [[Pulitzer Prize for Drama|Pulitzer Prize]], [[Hugo Award for Best Novel|Hugo Award]], [[Guardian First Book Award]] and the [[Franz Kafka Prize]].
