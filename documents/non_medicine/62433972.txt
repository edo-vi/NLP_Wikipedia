{{2019 Southeast Asian Games}}
There were numerous concerns and controversies about the [[2019 SEA Games]], which was hosted in the [[Philippines]].

== Accommodations and transportation ==
* Similar cases of delays and inadequacies in transportation and accommodations occurred upon the arrivals of the [[Cambodia national under-23 football team|Cambodia]], [[Myanmar national under-23 football team|Myanmar]], [[Thailand national under-23 football team|Thailand]], and [[Timor-Leste national under-23 football team|Timor-Leste]] national football teams, who were among the first set of athletes to arrive in the country ahead of the tournament, during the weekend of 23–24 November 2019:
** Pictures surfaced on social media of the Timor-Leste national football team waiting for their team bus to fetch them from [[Ninoy Aquino International Airport]], upon their arrival on 23 November. Their bus reportedly fetched them two and a half hours later than scheduled, which then transported them to the incorrect hotel they were billeted at.<ref>{{cite web |author=Harigovind |title=Timor-Leste football team left stranded at airport, taken to wrong hotel by SEA Games 2019 organisers – Report |url=https://www.foxsportsasia.com/sea-games/1201918/timor-leste-football-team-stranded-airport-wrong-hotel-sea-games-2019-organisers-report/ |website=Fox Sports Asia |access-date=24 November 2019 |date=24 November 2019}}</ref>
** The Myanmar national football team, who arrived in [[Manila]] a few hours after the Timorese team, reportedly also waited excessively for their bus to fetch them at the airport. In addition, they complained that their bus, a [[minibus]], was "cramped" and uncomfortable.<ref>{{cite web |last=Sharma |first=Sarthak |title=Myanmar football team unhappy with cramped team buses provided by SEA Games 2019 organisers – Report |url=https://www.foxsportsasia.com/sea-games/1202197/myanmar-football-team-unhappy-with-cramped-team-buses-provided-by-sea-games-2019-organisers-report/ |website=Fox Sports Asia |access-date=24 November 2019 |date=24 November 2019}}</ref> Myanmar-based media sources reported that the team was unable to hold their first training session due to the delays.<ref name="wrong foot">{{cite news |last1=Lozada |first1=Bong |last2=Tupas |first2=Cedelf |last3=Cabalza |first3=Dexter |title=SEA Games hosting starts on wrong foot |url=https://sports.inquirer.net/374628/sea-games-hosting-starts-on-wrong-foot-breaking |access-date=26 November 2019 |newspaper=Philippine Daily Inquirer |date=25 November 2019}}</ref>
** The Thailand national football team, through a [[Facebook]] post from the [[Football Association of Thailand]], complained about the limited and repeated food and water rations provided to them at their hotel, as well as the disorganization of their hotel rooms, having to accommodate three players into rooms designed to accommodate a maximum of only two.<ref name="Thailand, Cambodia">{{cite web|url=https://www.foxsportsasia.com/sea-games/1202204/cambodia-and-thailand-football-teams-complain-about-logistical-issues-at-sea-games-2019/|title=Cambodia and Thailand football teams complain about logistical issues at SEA Games 2019|last1=Sharma|first1=Sarthak|date=24 November 2019|website=Fox Sports Asia|access-date=24 November 2019}}</ref>  In response, association president [[Somyot Poompanmoung]] was notified of their situation and ordered the association to provide the team more food.

* A number of local volunteers for the SEA Games complained about the lack of updates on the status of their deployment and expressed confusion regarding the transportation arrangement for their travel to the venues. The PHISGOC initially announced that they would provide [[Premium Point-to-Point Bus Service]]s for the volunteers, although they clarified that they would be unable to provide accommodations and other modes of transportation for them. On 25 November 2019, SEA Games volunteer program head [[Chris Tiu]] responded that the lack of updates on the status of the volunteers' deployment was due to the numerous cases of missing requirements amongst volunteers. Tiu, however, reassured that they were finalizing their schedules. He added that the schedules would dictate the pickup points for the transportation of the volunteers.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Gregorio |first1=Xave |title=No final instructions, transportation directions yet for SEA Games volunteers |url=https://cnnphilippines.com/news/2019/11/25/SEA-Games-volunteers-instructions-directions.html |access-date=25 November 2019 |publisher=CNN Philippines |date=25 November 2019}}</ref>

=== Provision of meals ===

* The [[National Commission on Muslim Filipinos]] claimed that the PHISGOC had disregarded its recommendation to assist in the service of halal-certified meals, as well as the provision of segregated prayer rooms equipped with a [[qibla]], for Muslim delegates during the tournament. It followed complaints from the Singaporean delegation, who issued a letter to PHISGOC regarding the lack of halal food options in their accommodations. The ''[[South China Morning Post]]'' reports that Muslim athletes and officials from Singapore were served [[kikiam]], which contains [[ground pork]] that [[Religious restrictions on the consumption of pork#Prohibitions in Islamic law|Muslims are prohibited from consuming]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.scmp.com/sport/other-sport/article/3039392/sea-games-2019-singapore-muslim-athletes-served-pork-despite|title=SEA Games 2019: Muslim athletes suffer shortage of halal food, despite repeated reminders from Philippines' Islamic body|work=South China Morning Post|date=26 November 2019|access-date=2019-11-29}}</ref> only to rectify it after Singapore clarifies that their Muslim athletes were not served pork.<ref name="theindependent.sg" /> The head chef at the Athletes Village at [[New Clark City Sports Hub]] has also assured that all the meals served in the village would be fully halal-certified after consultation with the nutritionists of some of the delegations.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2019/11/26/1971978/philippine-agency-muslim-rights-says-sea-games-organizers-ignored-halal-food-offer|title=Philippine agency on Muslim rights says SEA Games organizers ignored halal food offer|last1=Luna|first1=Franco|date=26 November 2019|work=The Philippine Star|access-date=26 November 2019}}</ref>

Chung requested for additional food and police escorts for the Vietnamese team en route to a training session at the Biñan Football Stadium, claiming that traffic was affecting their training schedules.

== Financial concerns ==

* There were reports in March 2019 that the Philippines might lose hosting rights of the 2019 Southeast Asian Games due to budgetary concerns and an alleged leadership dispute within the [[Philippine Olympic Committee]]. The proposed budget allotted for the games has been cut down by Senate to {{Philippine peso|5 billion}} from {{Philippine peso|7.5 billion}}. The chairman of the organizing committee [[Alan Peter Cayetano]], who is also the [[Speaker of the House of Representatives of the Philippines|Speaker of the House of Representatives]], has assured that the hosting will push through citing support from the private sector and continued efforts by the organizers to secure government funding for the games.<ref>{{cite news |title='SEA Games will go on!' |url=https://businessmirror.com.ph/2019/03/23/sea-games-will-go-on/ |access-date=23 March 2019 |work=BusinessMirror |date=23 March 2019}}</ref>
* There was allegation of corruption by the PHILSOC Foundation led by Alan Peter Cayetano particularly it entered in an allegedly overprice deal regarding athlete uniform and sporting equipment. The Philippine government said that there could not be any corruption since it is the Philippine Sports Commission and the [[Department of Budget and Management]] are responsible for disbursement of funds in the games.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Esguerra |first1=Darryl John |title=Palace convinced no corruption in Phisgoc |url=https://sports.inquirer.net/358998/palace-convinced-no-corruption-in-phisgoc |access-date=27 July 2019 |newspaper=Philippine Daily Inquirer |date=24 July 2019}}</ref>
* Netizens criticized the PHISGOC's choice of venue for the bowling events, [[Starmalls|Starmall EDSA Shaw]] in [[Mandaluyong]]. Many claimed that the choice favoured the Villar [[Political dynasties in the Philippines|political family]] who own the Filipino real estate company [[Vista Land]], the parent company of Starmall. PHISGOC chairman, House Speaker Alan Peter Cayetano, denied the claim by clarifying that the [[bowling alley]] to be used during the events is operated by a different firm.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Roxas |first1=Pathricia Ann |title=Cayetano defends choice of Villar mall as SEA Games bowling venue, denies favoritism |url=https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1192912/fwd-cayetano-the-villars-never-asked-me-to-use-their-facilities-for-sea-games |access-date=26 November 2019 |newspaper=Philippine Daily Inquirer |date=21 November 2019}}</ref> Cayetano justified the PHISGOC's choice of venue as having met [[World Bowling]] standards.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Colcol |first1=Edwin |title=Cayetano on Starmall EDSA bowling center as SEA Games venue: It meets int'l standards |url=https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/sports/othersports/716261/cayetano-on-starmall-edsa-bowling-center-as-sea-games-venue-it-meets-int-l-standards/story/ |access-date=26 November 2019 |work=GMA News Online |date=21 November 2019}}</ref>
* Senate Minority Floor Leader [[Franklin Drilon]] questioned the {{Philippine peso|50 million}} ([[United States dollar|US$]]1 million) budget allotted for the construction of the cauldron. During the plenary deliberations of the [[Bases Conversion and Development Authority]]'s (BCDA) budget for the 2019 SEA Games at the [[Philippine Senate]], Drilon lamented that the budget could have been used for other purposes of national importance, such as the construction of classrooms instead. Senator [[Sonny Angara]], chairman of the Senate finance committee, defended the budget by saying that the cauldron is intended to showcase Filipino ingenuity. Senator [[Bong Go]], chairman of the Senate sports committee, added that the government plans to lease out the cauldron after the event.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Ilas |first1=Joyce |last2=de Guzman |first2=Luchi |title=₱50 million budget for SEA Games cauldron questioned |url=https://www.cnnphilippines.com/news/2019/11/18/sea-games-cauldron-bcda-budget-senate.html |access-date=24 November 2019 |publisher=CNN Philippines |date=18 November 2019}}</ref> President [[Rodrigo Duterte]] denied corruption allegations over its construction and reiterated Angara's claim, even adding that the PHISGOC commissioned [[Francisco Mañosa]], a [[National Artist of the Philippines|National Artist of the Philippines for Architecture]], to design the cauldron.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Aurelio |first1=Julie |title=Duterte defends P55-M SEA Games cauldron |url=https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1192591/president-defends-p55-m-sea-games-cauldron |access-date=24 November 2019 |newspaper=Philippine Daily Inquirer |date=21 November 2019}}</ref> Alan Peter Cayetano denied that the budget for the cauldron was overpriced and said that it was cheaper than the cauldron constructed for the [[2015 Southeast Asian Games]] in [[Singapore]], which cost around {{Philippine peso|62 million}} ($1.2 million).<ref>{{cite news |last1=Domingo |first1=Katrina |title='Not excessive': Cayetano justifies P45-M price tag of SEA Games cauldron |url=https://news.abs-cbn.com/news/11/19/19/it-is-the-symbol-cayetano-justifies-p55-million-sea-games-cauldron |access-date=24 November 2019 |work=ABS-CBN News |date=19 November 2019}}</ref>
* In November 2019, the BCDA denied involvement in a funding scheme with the Malaysian investment holding firm MTD Capital Berhad for the construction of some facilities in the New Clark City Sports Hub. Local media sources reported that the firm would receive half of the shares earned from the usage of the facilities, estimated to be {{Philippine peso|2.5 billion}} in return. While the [[Philippine Competition Commission]] had approved the joint venture between the BCDA and MTD for the construction of the [[National Government Administrative Center]] in March, the BCDA claimed that none of the firm's sources of finance originated from the Philippine government. Instead, the Philippine government opted to pay MTD in full in order to avoid [[accrued interest]], according to the BCDA's official statement. The BCDA admitted that they had yet to pay the firm.<ref>{{cite news |title=BCDA denies onerous agreement with Malaysian firm |url=https://www.cnnphilippines.com/news/2019/11/22/BCDA-denies-11-billion-loan-deal-Malaysian-firm-SEA-Games.html |access-date=26 November 2019 |publisher=CNN Philippines |date=22 November 2019}}</ref>

== Infrastructure and logistical delays ==

* On 21 November 2019, nine days before the start of the 2019 SEA Games, House Speaker Alan Peter Cayetano confirmed that preparations at the [[Rizal Memorial Sports Complex]] in Manila and venues in [[Tagaytay]] remain incomplete. He cited delays in the passage of spending bills containing the SEA Games budget in the [[Congress of the Philippines]], which in turn delayed the governmental procurement process.

Carrasco refuted saying that wrestling's international federation, United World of Wrestling (UWW) should have signed the sport's events handbook for the games.

Malaysian gymnast Izzah Amzan scored identical score (15.200) with gold medalist Koi Sie Yan in the ribbon apparatus event on December 7, but Amzan was awarded a silver medal due to the judges deeming she performed a less difficult routine following tiebreaker rules set by the International Gymnastics Federation. The two gymnast were named joint gold medalists but this was revoked a day later which led to Malaysia filing a protest. The Philippines SEA Games Organising Committee (PHISGOC) has agreed to reinstate the ribbon event gold medal to Malaysian rhythmic gymnast Izzah Amzan after studying the technical regulations for the Games.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nst.com.my/sports/others/2019/12/546736/izzah-gets-back-her-ribbon-gold|title = Izzah gets back her ribbon gold &#124; New Straits Times|date = 10 December 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com.my/sport/gymnastics/2019/12/10/m039sia039s-izzah-has-gold-medal-reinstated-in-ribbon-event-in-sea-games|title = M'sia's Izzah has gold medal reinstated in ribbon event in SEA Games}}</ref><ref>https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/sports/2019/12/10/malaysian-gymnast-gets-gold-medal-back-after-protest/ {{Bare URL inline|date=August 2022}}</ref>
