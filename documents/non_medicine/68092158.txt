{{Short description|Chinese Communist Party term for historical viewpoints wholly critical of it}}
'''Historical nihilism''' ({{lang-zh|s=历史虚无主义|p=Lìshǐ xūwú zhǔyì}}) is a term used by the [[Chinese Communist Party]] (CCP) and some scholars in China to describe research, discussions, or viewpoints deemed to contradict an official state version of history in a manner perceived to question or challenge the legitimacy of the CCP. The CCP opposes historical interpretations that are critical of it, the [[People's Liberation Army]], [[socialism]], and related topics.<ref name=":1">{{Cite news |last=Mai |first=Jun |date=2021-05-11 |title=2 million posts deleted for 'historical nihilism' as party centenary nears |language=en |newspaper=[[South China Morning Post]] |url=https://www.scmp.com/news/china/politics/article/3132957/china-deletes-2-million-online-posts-historical-nihilism |url-status=live |access-date=2022-01-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220105031021/https://www.scmp.com/news/china/politics/article/3132957/china-deletes-2-million-online-posts-historical-nihilism |archive-date=2022-01-05}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last=Brown |first=Kerry |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/958084156 |title=China and the new Maoists |date=2016 |others=Simone van Nieuwenhuizen |isbn=978-1-78360-761-7 |location=London |pages=114 |oclc=958084156 |author-link=Kerry Brown (historian)}}</ref> Viewpoints the state judges to be historical nihilism are subject to [[Censorship in China|censorship]] and legal prosecution.<ref name=":1" />

==Background==
Historical nihilism has been defined in CCP publications as criticism of the entirety of an entity, such as the CCP, its national heroes, leaders, socialism and its official history, by citing only certain events about the entity without consideration of the whole.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Brown |first1=Kerry |url=https://archive.org/details/chinanewmaoists0000brow |title=China and the New Maoists |last2=Nieuwenhuizen |first2=Simone van |date=2016-08-15 |publisher=[[Bloomsbury Publishing]] |isbn=978-1-78360-761-7 |pages=113 |language=en |oclc=958084156}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last1=Jin |first1=Wang |last2=Shifang |first2=Wen |title=Analysis of Historical Nihilism on People's Daily in 1949～1989--《Contemporary China History Studies》2017年02期 |url=http://www.en.cnki.com.cn/Article_en/CJFDTotal-DZSY201702002.htm |access-date=2022-12-18 |website=[[CNKI]]}}</ref> Although 'incorrect' interpretations of history would have been censored and punished during the period of [[Mao Zedong]] (1949-1976) and [[Deng Xiaoping]] (1978-1989), neither leader made a clear attempt to engage against 'historical nihilism' as it is specifically understood today. According to Chinese historian [[Zhang Lifan]], the main push to fight against 'historical nihilism', according to its specific modern meaning, undertaken by the CCP has its origin following the [[1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre]] and [[revolutions of 1989|coinciding events]] within the [[Eastern Bloc|communist countries of Eastern Europe]]. In December of that year, [[Jiang Zemin]] made a speech in which he said the [[Bourgeois liberalization|liberation of the bourgeoisie]] had led to the spread of 'national nihilism' and 'historical nihilism', which had entered party thinking and brought about confusion.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/chinese-news-57581184 |title=中共建党百年："虚无主义"阴影下剪不断、理还乱的中共历史 |trans-title=The 100th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China: the history of the Communist Party |date=June 28, 2021 |publisher=[[BBC News]] |access-date=June 30, 2021 |archive-date=July 1, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210701041119/https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/chinese-news-57581184 |url-status=live }}</ref>

{{Block quote|text=[[Farewell to Revolution|Rejecting the revolution]]; claiming that the revolution led by the Chinese Communist Party resulted only in destruction; denying the historical inevitability in China’s choice of the Socialist road, calling it the wrong path, and the Party’s and new China’s history a “continuous series of mistakes”; rejecting the accepted conclusions on historical events and figures, disparaging our Revolutionary precursors, and vilifying the Party’s leaders. Recently, some people took advantage of Comrade Mao Zedong’s 120th birthday in order to deny the scientific and guiding value of Mao Zedong thought. Some people try to cleave apart the period that preceded Reform and Opening from the period that followed, or even to set these two periods in opposition to one another. By rejecting CCP history and the history of New China, historical nihilism seeks to fundamentally undermine the CCP’s historical purpose, which is tantamount to denying the legitimacy of the CCP’s long-term political dominance.}}

==Government characterizations of historical nihilism==
Media and education in China is not allowed to represent history in a manner that is forbidden by government censors.

When [[Xi Jinping]] became CCP general secretary and [[paramount leader]] in January 2013, he made a speech in which he said, 'The history of the post-reform period cannot be used to contradict the history of the pre-reform period, and the history of the pre-reform period cannot be used to contradict the history of the post-reform period'.<ref name=":0" /> Although China's reforms since the 1980s caused it to radically change and abandon many of the Marxist policies that had existed under Mao Zedong, the official state-sanctioned version of history under Xi Jinping teaches an interpretation of continuity, praising both the contributions made by the CCP of Mao's generation and the CCP of the post-reform period. This is in contrast to interpretations in the period prior to Xi Jinping whereby some of Mao's policies could receive heavy criticism and the official stance of the party was a rejection of the Cultural Revolution, which had been referred to as the 'Ten Year Calamity' (十年浩劫).<ref>{{Cite news |date=September 9, 2021 |title=毛泽东、斯大林、希特勒等独裁者"不再风光"的最后一程 |language=zh |trans-title=The Last Journey of Mao Zedong, Stalin, Hitler and Other Dictators "No Longer Scenery" |publisher=[[BBC News]] |url=https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/world-58491454 |url-status=live |access-date=September 10, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210910185550/https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/world-58491454 |archive-date=September 10, 2021}}</ref>

Academics Jian Xu, Qian Gong, and Wen Yin write that the CCP's attention to historical nihilism "has gained momentum in the 21st century due to the rise of market-oriented cultural production in post-socialist China as well as the development of new media technologies."<ref name=":6">{{Cite journal |last1=Xu |first1=Jian |last2=Gong |first2=Qian |last3=Yin |first3=Wen |date=November 2022 |title=Maintaining ideological security and legitimacy in digital China: Governance of cyber historical nihilism |journal=Media International Australia |language=en |volume=185 |issue=1 |pages=26–40 |doi=10.1177/1329878X221111826 |s2cid=250302432 |issn=1329-878X|hdl=20.500.11937/88839 |hdl-access=free }}</ref> They cite the TV drama adaptation of "Red Classics" as "a pertinent example of historical nihilism caused by market orientation in cultural production," explaining:<ref name=":6" />
