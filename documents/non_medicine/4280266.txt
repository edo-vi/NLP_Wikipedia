'''Persistent pupillary membrane''' ('''PPM''') is a condition of the [[human eye|eye]] involving remnants of a fetal membrane that persist as strands of tissue crossing the [[pupil]]. The pupillary membrane in [[mammal]]s exists in the [[fetus]] as a source of blood supply for the [[lens (anatomy)|lens]].  It normally atrophies from the time of birth to the age of four to eight weeks.<ref name=Gelatt_1999>{{cite book|editor=Gelatt, Kirk N. |title=Veterinary Ophthalmology|edition=3rd|publisher=Lippincott, Williams & Wilkins|year=1999|isbn=0-683-30076-8}}</ref> PPM occurs when this atrophy is incomplete.  It generally does not cause any symptoms.  The strands can connect to the [[cornea]] or lens, but most commonly to other parts of the [[iris (anatomy)|iris]].  Attachment to the cornea can cause small [[Corneal opacity|corneal opacities]], while attachment to the lens can cause small [[cataract]]s.  Using topical [[atropine]] to dilate the pupil may help break down PPMs.

In dogs, PPM is inherited in the [[Basenji]] but can occur in other breeds such as the [[Pembroke Welsh Corgi]], [[Chow Chow]], [[English Mastiff|Mastiff]], and [[English Cocker Spaniel]]. It can also be observed in [[cat]]s, [[horse]]s, and [[cattle]].<ref>{{Cite book |title=Veterinary ophthalmology |date=2021 |editor=Kirk N.
