[[Confucianism|Confucian]] historians condemned the emperor [[Qin Shi Huang]] in the '''''Ten Crimes of Qin''''', a list that was compiled to highlight his tyrannical actions. The famous Han poet and statesman [[Jia Yi]] concluded his essay '''''The Faults of Qin''''' ([[:zh:过秦论]]) with what was to become the standard Confucian judgment of the reasons for Qin's collapse. Jia Yi's essay, admired as a masterpiece of [[rhetoric]] and [[reasoning]], was copied into two great Han histories and has had a far-reaching influence on Chinese political thought as a classic illustration of Confucian theory. He explained the ultimate weakness of Qin as a result of its ruler's ruthless pursuit of power, the precise factor which had made it so powerful; for as [[Confucius]] had taught, the strength of a government ultimately is based on the support of the people and virtuous conduct of the ruler.  <ref>William Thedore de Bary, ed.
