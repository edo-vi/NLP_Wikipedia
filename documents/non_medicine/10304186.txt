'''''Borrelia anserina''''' is a helical [[spirochete]] [[bacterium]] with dimensions around 8-20/0,2-0,3{{huh|date=March 2021}} [[Micrometre|μm]] and with five to eight spirals. Their mobility is very high. ''B. anserina'' can be colored with the [[Wright's stain|May Grunwald-Giemsa method]].<ref name=Diurpaneu>{{cite book | author = Gheorghe Rapunteanu, Sorin Rapunteanu (editors) | title = Bacteriologie Veterinara Speciala | edition = I | publisher = Editura AcademicPress, Cluj-Napoca, Romania | year = 2005 | isbn = 973-7950-95-X }}</ref>

==Cultivation==
In microbiological laboratories, ''B. anserina'' bacteria can be grown on special protein-enriched media (rich in ovoalbumins or animal tissue (that contains [[myoglobin]])), in [[wikt:anaerobic|anaerobic]] conditions. They can also be grown in embryonic chicken eggs. The laboratory cultivation of ''B. anserina'' is rarely done and constitutes a diagnostic method in bird borreliosis and spirochetosis.<ref name="Diurpaneu"/>
''B. anserina'' used to be maintained in embryonic chicken eggs or by serial passages in domestic chickens until in 1986 it was discovered that it could be cultivated in Barbour-Stoenner-Kelly (BSK) medium, which facilitated and made future research more cost-effective.

==Pathogenity==
''B. anserina'' is a pathogenic agent for poultry (chickens, turkeys, ducks etc.) and causes a disease called borreliosis or spirochetosis. This bacterium is transmitted from bird to bird by [[ticks]] from the ''[[Argas]]'' and ''[[Ornitodorus]]''{{typo help inline|date=March 2021}}<!-- [[Ornithodoros]]? --> genera. The major symptoms of an infection with ''B. anserina'' are: [[anemia]], [[diarrhea]], and severe neurological dysfunctions.{{facts|date=March 2021}}
