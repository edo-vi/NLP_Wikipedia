In 1984, Conte founded the [[Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative]] (BALCO), a sports nutrition center first located in Millbrae, California and later relocated to [[Burlingame, California|Burlingame]], [[California]]. The [[United States Anti-Doping Agency]] (USADA) says he developed the banned steroid [[tetrahydrogestrinone]] (THG) with the help of bodybuilding chemist [[Patrick Arnold]]. Pursuant to a plea bargain struck with prosecutors, he entered guilty pleas in July 2005 to one count of conspiracy to distribute steroids and a second count of laundering a portion of a check. He was sentenced in October to spend four months in the federal [[Taft Correctional Institution]] in [[Taft, California]], and another four on house arrest.

In December 2004, he participated in an interview with [[Martin Bashir]] on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[20/20 (US television series)|20/20]]'' program, where he admitted to running doping programs, which have broken [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] records, as well as revealing that: "The whole history of the games is just full of corruption, cover-up, performance-enhancing drug use."<ref>{{cite news| url=http://sport.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,10488,1366955,00.html | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=How drugs shattered America's Olympic dreams | first=Paul | last=Harris | date=2004-12-05 | access-date=2010-05-27}}</ref>

In the interview he implicated, among others, five-time Olympic gold medalist [[Marion Jones]] and her partner [[Tim Montgomery]], [[Kelli White]] (who later admitted using performance-enhancing drugs), British athlete [[Dwain Chambers]], and NFL player [[Bill Romanowski]].

On December 21, 2006, [[Yahoo Sports]] reported that one of Conte's initial defense lawyers, [[Troy Ellerman]], had been targeted by the [[FBI]] as a possible source of leaks to the media during the [[Barry Bonds]] probe.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/top/news;_ylt=AoI9rY126d4BACsqIp8HJ7I5nYcB?slug=jo-balco122106&prov=yhoo&type=lgns |title=BALCO leaks exposed - Yahoo!

It was also reported that FBI agents were an additional source of leaks.

In May 2007, Conte claimed to again be providing supplements for [[Dwain Chambers]], who left athletics to play in the [[NFL Europa]] league for the [[Hamburg Sea Devils (NFL Europe)|Hamburg Sea Devils]] before returning to athletics in 2008. According to Conte, these nutritional supplements, provided via his company Scientific Nutrition for Advanced Conditioning, are perfectly legal.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/american_football/6703453.stm | work=BBC News | title=Chambers to have extra dope tests | date=2007-05-30 | access-date=2010-05-27}}</ref>
