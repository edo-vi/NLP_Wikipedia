The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of and topical guide to geology:

'''[[Geology]]''' – one of the [[Earth science]]s – is the study of the Earth, with the general exclusion of present-day life, flow within the ocean, and the atmosphere. The field of geology encompasses the composition, structure, physical properties, and history of Earth's components, and the processes by which it is shaped. Geologists typically study [[rock (geology)|rock]], [[sediment]], [[soil]], [[river]]s, and [[natural resource]]s.
