'''LIV Golf''' ({{IPAc-en|l|ɪ|v}} {{respelling|LIV}}) is a [[professional golf tour]]. The name "LIV" refers to the [[Roman numeral]]s for 54, the score if every hole on a par-72 course were [[Birdie (golf)|birdied]] and the number of holes to be played at LIV events.<ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Harig |first=Bob |date=2022-05-31 |title=FAQ of the LIV Golf Invitational Series: Field Taking Shape for First Event |url=https://www.si.com/golf/news/faq-liv-golf-invitational-series |magazine=[[Sports Illustrated]] |accessdate=2022-06-06 |archive-date=14 June 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220614172005/https://www.si.com/golf/news/faq-liv-golf-invitational-series |url-status=live }}</ref> The first '''LIV Golf Invitational Series''' event started on 9 June 2022, at the [[Centurion Club]] near St Albans in Hertfordshire, UK.

LIV Golf is financed by the [[Public Investment Fund]], the [[sovereign wealth fund]] of Saudi Arabia.

===Proposed merger of commercial rights of LIV, PGA and European Tours===
On 6 June 2023, LIV Golf, the PGA Tour, and PGA European Tour announced that the three organizations would pool their commercial rights into a new for-profit venture, which will be funded by the Public Investment Fund. The announcement stated that the merger is intended to "unify the game of golf on a global basis" and "ensure that all stakeholders benefit from a model that delivers maximum excitement and competition among the game's best players." Current PGA Tour commissioner [[Jay Monahan]] will serve as CEO of the new entity, with [[Yasir Al-Rumayyan|Yasir Al-Rymayyan]] as chairman, and the PGA Tour appointing the majority of its board. All three tours will maintain administrative oversight and sanctioning of their events.
