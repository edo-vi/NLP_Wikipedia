A '''mode of toxic action''' is a common set of [[physiological]] and [[behavioral]] signs that characterize a type of adverse biological response.<ref name="rand">{{cite book | author = Rand G | title = Fundamentals of Aquatic Toxicology: Effects, Environmental Fate, and Risk Assessment | year = 1995 | publisher = CRC Press | location =Boca Raton, FL | isbn = 1-56032-091-5 }}</ref> A [[mode of action]] should not be confused with [[mechanism of action]], which refer to the [[biochemical]] processes underlying a given mode of action.<ref name="escher02">{{cite journal |vauthors=Escher BI, Hermens JL | title = Modes of action in ecotoxicology: their role in body burdens, species sensitivity, QSARs, and mixture effects | journal = Environ.

There are two major types of modes of toxic action: non-specific acting toxicants and specific acting toxicants. Non-specific acting toxicants are those that produce [[narcotic|narcosis]], while specific acting toxicants are those that are non-narcotic and that produce a specific action at a specific target site.

== Types ==

=== Non-specific ===

[[Wikipedia talk:Articles for creation/Fish Acute Toxicity Syndromes (FATS)|Non-specific acting modes of toxic action]] result in [[narcotic|narcosis]]; therefore, narcosis is a mode of toxic action. Narcosis is defined as a generalized depression in [[biological activity]] due to the presence of [[toxicant]] [[molecules]] in the organism.<ref name="rand" /> The target site and mechanism of toxic action through which narcosis affects organisms are still unclear, but there are [[hypothesis|hypotheses]] that support that it occurs through alterations in the [[cell membranes]] at specific sites of the membranes, such as the [[lipid bilayer|lipid layers]] or the [[proteins]] bound to the membranes. Even though continuous exposure to a [[narcotic]] toxicant can produce [[death]], if the exposure to the toxicant is stopped, narcosis can be reversible.

=== Specific ===

[[Toxicant]]s that at low [[concentrations]] modify or inhibit some biological process by binding at a specific site or [[molecule]] have a specific acting mode of toxic action.<ref name="rand" /> However, at high enough concentrations, toxicants with specific acting modes of toxic actions can produce [[narcotic|narcosis]] that may or may not be reversible. Nevertheless, the specific action of the toxicant is always shown first because it requires lower concentrations.{{cn|date=October 2023}}

There are several specific acting modes of toxic action:
* '''''[[Wikipedia talk:Articles for creation/Fish Acute Toxicity Syndromes (FATS)|Uncouplers of oxidative phosphorylation]]'''''. Involves toxicants that uncouple the two processes that occur in [[oxidative phosphorylation]]: [[electron transfer]] and [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP) production.
* '''''Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors'''''. [[Acetylcholinesterase|AChE]] is an [[enzyme]] associated with [[nerve]] [[synapses]] that it’s designed to regulate nerve impulses by breaking down the [[neurotransmitter]] [[Acetylcholine]] (ACh). When toxicants bind to AChE, they inhibit the breakdown of ACh. This results in continued nerve impulses across the synapses, which eventually cause nerve system damage. Examples of AChE inhibitors are [[organophosphates]] and [[carbamates]], which are components found in [[pesticides]] (see [[Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors]]).
* '''''Irritants'''''. These are chemicals that cause an [[inflammation|inflammatory]] effect on living tissue by chemical action at the site of contact. The resulting effect of [[Irritation|irritants]] is an increase in the [[volume]] of cells due to a change in size ([[hypertrophy]]) or an increase in the number of cells ([[hyperplasia]]). Examples of irritants are [[benzaldehyde]], [[acrolein]], [[zinc sulphate]] and [[chlorine]].
* '''''Central nervous system (CNS) seizure agents'''''. [[Central nervous system|CNS]] seizure agents inhibit [[cellular signaling]] by acting as [[receptor antagonists]]. They result in the inhibition of biological responses. Examples of CNS seizure agents are [[organochlorine]] [[pesticides]].
* '''''Respiratory blockers'''''. These are toxicants that affect [[Respiration (physiology)|respiration]] by interfering with the [[electron transport chain]] in the [[mitochondria]]. Examples of respiratory blockers are [[rotenone]] and [[cyanide]].

== Determination ==

The pioneer work of identifying the major categories of modes of toxic action (see description above) was conducted by investigators from the [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) at the Duluth Laboratory using fish,<ref name="rand" /><ref name="mccarty93">{{cite journal|vauthors=McCarty LS, McCarty D | title = Enhancing ecotoxicological modeling and assessment: body residues and modes of toxic action|journal=Environmental Science & Technology | year = 1993 | volume = 27 | issue = 9 | pages = 1719–1728 | doi=10.1021/es00046a001| bibcode = 1993EnST...27.1718M}}</ref><ref name="escher10">{{cite journal |vauthors=Escher BI, Ashauer R, Dyer S, Hermens JL, Lee JH, Leslie HA, Mayer P, Meador JP, Warne MS | title = Crucial role of mechanisms and modes of toxic action for understanding tissue residue toxicity and internal effect concentrations of organic chemicals | journal = Integr Environ Assess Manag | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | pages = 28–49 |date=January 2011 | pmid = 21184568 | doi = 10.1002/ieam.100  | s2cid = 20133190 | url = https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1258&context=usdeptcommercepub }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=McKim JM, Schmieder PK, Carlson RW, Hunt EP | title = Use of respiratory-cardiovascular responses of rainbow trout (Salmo gairdneri) in identifying acute toxicity syndromes in fish: Part 1.

They proposed the FATS by assessing the [[behavioral]] and [[physiological]] responses of the fish when subjected to [[toxicity test]]s, such as [[locomotive]] activities, body [[color]], [[ventilation (physiology)|ventilation]] patterns, [[cough]] [[rate function|rate]], [[heart rate]], and others.<ref name="escher02" />

It has been proposed that modes of toxic action could be estimated by developing a data set of critical body residues (CBR).<ref name="mccarty93" /> The CBR is the whole-body [[concentration]] of a chemical that is associated with a given adverse biological response<ref name="rand" /> and it is estimated using a [[partition coefficient]] and a [[bioconcentration]] factor. The whole-body residues are reasonable first [[approximations]] of the amount of chemical present at the toxic action site(s).<ref name="mccarty93" /> Because different modes of toxic action generally appear to be associated with different ranges of body residues,<ref name="mccarty93" /> modes of toxic action can then be separated into categories. However, it is unlikely that every chemical has the same mode of toxic action in every organism, so this [[Heart rate variability|variability]] should be considered.<ref name="mccarty93" /> The effects of [[mixture]] toxicity should be considered as well, even though mixture toxicity it's generally [[additive map|additive]],<ref name="mccarty93" /> chemicals with more than one mode of toxic action may contribute to toxicity.<ref name="escher10" />

[[Scientific modeling|Modeling]] has become a common used tool to predict modes of toxic action in the last decade. The [[mathematical model|models]] are based in [[Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship]]s (QSARs), which are [[mathematical models]] that relate the [[biological activity]] of molecules to their [[chemical structure]]s and corresponding chemical and [[Physical chemistry|physicochemical]] properties.<ref name="rand" /> QSARs can then predict modes of toxic action of unknown compounds by comparing its characteristic toxicity profile and chemical structure to reference compounds with known toxicity profiles and chemical structures.<ref name="escher02" /> Russom and colleagues<ref name="russom">{{cite journal |vauthors=Russom CL, Bradbury SP, Broderius SJ, Hammermeister DE, Drummond RA | title = Predicting modes of toxic action from chemical structure: acute toxicity in the fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) | journal = Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry | year = 1997 | volume = 16 | issue = 5 | pages = 948–967 | doi=10.1002/etc.5620160514| s2cid = 85193230 }}</ref> were one of the first group of researchers being able to classify modes of toxic action with the use of QSARs; they classified 600 chemicals as narcotics. Even though QSARs are a useful tool for predicting modes of toxic action, chemicals having multiple modes of toxic action can obscure QSAR analyses. Therefore, these models are continuously being developed.{{cn|date=October 2023}}

== Applications ==

=== Environmental risk assessment ===

The objective of [[environmental impact assessment|environmental risk assessment]] is to protect the environment from adverse effects.<ref name="escher02" /> Researchers are further developing QSAR models with the ultimate goal providing a clear insight about a mode of toxic action, but also about what the actual target site is, the concentration of the chemical at this target site, and the interaction occurring at the target site,<ref name="escher02" /> as well as to predict the modes of toxic action in [[mixtures]]. Information on the mode of toxic action is crucial not only in understanding joint toxic effects and potential interactions between chemicals in mixtures, but also for developing assays for the evaluation of complex mixtures in the field.

=== Regulation ===

The combination of [[behavioral]] and [[physiological]] responses, CBR estimates, and chemical fate and [[bioaccumulation]] QSAR models can be a powerful regulatory tool<ref name="mccarty93" /> to address [[pollution]] and toxicity in areas where [[effluents]] are discharged.
