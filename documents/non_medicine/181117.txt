<span lang="hu-formal" dir="ltr">An</span> '''epistle''' ({{IPAc-en|ᵻ|ˈ|p|ɪ|s|əl}}; {{etymology|grc|''{{wiktgrc|ἐπιστολή}}'' ({{grc-transl|ἐπιστολή}})|letter}}) is a writing directed or sent to a person or group of people, usually an elegant and formal [[Didacticism|didactic]] letter.  The epistle genre of letter-writing was common in [[ancient Egypt]] as part of the [[Scribe|scribal-school]] writing curriculum. The letters in the [[New Testament]] from [[Twelve apostles|Apostles]] to [[Early Christianity|Christians]] are usually referred to as epistles. Those traditionally attributed to [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]] are known as [[Pauline epistles]] and the others as [[General epistles|catholic (i.e., "general") epistles]].

==Ancient Egyptian epistles==
The [[Ancient Egyptian literature|ancient Egyptians]] wrote epistles, most often for [[pedagogy|pedagogical]] reasons. [[Egyptologist]] Edward Wente (1990) speculates that the [[Fifth dynasty of Egypt|Fifth-dynasty]] Pharaoh [[Djedkare Isesi]]—in his many letters sent to his [[Vizier (Ancient Egypt)|viziers]]—was a pioneer in the epistolary genre.<ref name=wente>{{cite book|title=Letters from Ancient Egypt: Society of Biblical Literature Writing from the Ancient World Series Volume 1|year=1990|publisher=Scholars Press|location=Atlanta, GA|isbn=978-1555404734|author=Edward F. Wente|hdl=2027/heb.02262.0001.001|translator = Edmund S. Meltzer}}</ref> Its existence is firmly attested during the [[Sixth dynasty of Egypt|Sixth Dynasty]] of the [[Old Kingdom]], and is prominently featured in the educational guide ''The Book of Kemit'' written during the [[Eleventh dynasty of Egypt|Eleventh Dynasty]].<ref name=wente/> A standardized formulae for epistolary compositions existed by the time of the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt]]. The epistolary formulae used in the [[Ramesside Period]] found its roots in the letters composed during the [[Amarna Period]] of the [[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt|Twentieth Dynasty]]. Wente describes the "Satirical Letter" found on the [[Papyrus Anastasi&nbsp;I]] of the [[Nineteenth dynasty of Egypt|Nineteenth Dynasty]] as an epistle which was commonly copied as a writing exercise by Egyptian schoolchildren on ceramic [[ostraca]] (over eighty examples of which have been found so far by archaeologists). Epistle letters were also written to the dead, and, by the Ramesside Period, to the [[Ancient Egyptian religion|gods]]; the latter became even more widespread during the eras of [[History of Persian Egypt|Persian]] and [[History of Ptolemaic Egypt|Greek]] domination.<ref name=wente/>

==Ancient Greece and Rome==
{{Expand section|date=January 2010}}
Epistles in prose and verse were a major genre of literature among the [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] and particularly the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]. The letters of [[Cicero]] are one of the most important sources on the history of the late [[Roman Republic]] and preserve features of colloquial [[Latin]] not always in evidence in his speeches and treatises. The letters of [[Pliny the Younger]] likewise are studied as both examples of Latin prose with self-conscious literary qualities and sources for historical information. [[Ovid]] produced three collections of verse epistles, composed in [[elegiac couplet]]s: the ''[[Heroides]]'', letters written in the person of legendary women to their absent lovers; and the ''[[Tristia]]'' and ''[[Ex Ponto]]'', written in first person during the poet's [[Ovid#Exile to Tomis|exile]]. The epistles of [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], with their moral or philosophical ruminations, influenced later [[Church Fathers|patristic]] writers.

==Form of Christian epistles==
Christian epistles, both those in the New Testament and among the early Christian Fathers, were written in accordance with the formalized, [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] tradition. This reflects the amount of Hellenistic influence upon the epistle writers, especially in the case of Paul. Classicist Steve Reece has compared thousands of Greek, Roman, and Jewish letters contemporary with Paul and observes that Paul follows many of the normal epistolary conventions.<ref>Reece, Steve. ''Paul's Large Letters: Pauline Subscriptions in the Light of Ancient Epistolary Conventions.'' London: T&T Clark, 2016. [https://www.academia.edu/30640330/Pauls_Large_Letters_Pauls_Autographic_Subscriptions_in_the_Light_of_Ancient_Epistolary_Conventions_T_and_T_Clark_2017_ Paul's Large Letters]</ref>

===Opening/greetings===
In contrast to modern letters, epistles usually named the author at the very beginning, followed by the recipient (for example, see [[Philippians]] [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=philippians%201:1;&version=31; 1:1]). The scribe (or more correctly, the [[amanuensis]]) who wrote down the letter may be named at the end of the epistle (e.g., [[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=rom%2016:22;&version=31; 16:22]). In the absence of a [[postal system]], the [[courier]] may also be named (e.g. [[Ephesians]] [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=eph%206:21-22;&version=31; 6:21–22]).

After the names of the author and recipient, Pauline epistles often open with the greeting, "Grace and peace to you." "Grace" was a common Hellenistic greeting, while "peace" ([[shalom]]) was the common [[Judaism|Jewish]] greeting; this reflected Paul's dual identity in Jewish faith and Hellenistic culture. There may also be a word of thanks to the audience. In secular letters, a prayer or wish for health followed.

The body begins with a brief statement introducing the main topic of the entire body.

==New Testament epistles==
The epistles of the [[New Testament]] canon are usually divided as follows:

===Pauline epistles===
{{Main|Pauline epistles}}
{{Further|Authorship of the Pauline epistles|Authorship of the Epistle to the Hebrews|Pastoral epistles}}
The Pauline epistles, also called Epistles of Paul or Letters of Paul, are the thirteen books of the [[New Testament]] attributed to [[Paul the Apostle]], although the authorship of some is in dispute. Among these [[epistles]] are some of the earliest extant Christian documents. They provide an insight into the beliefs and controversies of [[early Christianity]]. As part of the [[Biblical canon|canon]] of the New Testament, they are foundational texts for both [[Christian theology]] and [[Christian ethics|ethics]]. The [[Epistle to the Hebrews]], although it does not bear his name, was [[Authorship of the Epistle to the Hebrews|traditionally considered Pauline]] (although Origen questioned its authorship in the 3rd century CE), but from the 16th century onwards opinion steadily moved against Pauline authorship and few scholars now ascribe it to Paul, mostly because it does not read like any of his other epistles in style and content.<ref>''The New Jerome Biblical Commentary'', publ. Geoffrey Chapman, 1989, chapter 60, at p. 920, col. 2 "That Paul is neither directly nor indirectly the author is now the view of scholars almost without exception. For details, see Kümmel, I[ntroduction to the] N[ew] T[estament, Nashville, 1975] 392–94, 401–03"</ref> Most scholars agree that Paul actually wrote seven of the Pauline epistles, but that four of the epistles in Paul's name are [[pseudepigraphic]] ([[Ephesians]], [[1 Timothy|First Timothy]], [[2 Timothy|Second Timothy]], and [[Epistle to Titus|Titus]]<ref name="New Testament Letter Structure">[http://catholic-resources.org/Bible/Paul-Disputed.htm New Testament Letter Structure], from [http://catholic-resources.org Catholic Resources] by Felix Just, S.J.</ref>) and that two other epistles are of questionable authorship ([[2 Thessalonians|Second Thessalonians]] and [[Colossians]]).<ref name="New Testament Letter Structure"/> According to some scholars, Paul wrote these letters with the help of a secretary, or [[amanuensis]],<ref>Richards, E. Randolph. ''Paul and First-Century Letter Writing: Secretaries, Composition and Collection''. Downers Grove, IL; Leicester, England: InterVarsity Press; Apollos, 2004. {{page needed|date=July 2020}}</ref> who would have influenced their style, if not their theological content.

The Pauline epistles are usually placed between the [[Acts of the Apostles]] and the [[Catholic epistles]] in modern editions. Most Greek manuscripts, however, place the General epistles first,<ref>{{cite book | title=The Canon of the New Testament: Its Origin, Development, and Significance | last=Metzger | first=Bruce M. | year=1987 | pages=295–96 | publisher=Clarendon Press | isbn=0198261802 | url=http://ixoyc.net/data/Fathers/134.pdf | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130601181717/http://www.ixoyc.net/data/Fathers/134.pdf | archive-date=2013-06-01 }}</ref> and a few minuscules ([[Minuscule 175|175]], [[Minuscule 325|325]], [[Minuscule 336|336]], and [[Minuscule 1424|1424]]) place the Pauline epistles at the end of the New Testament.

===Catholic (i.e., "general") epistles===
{{Main article|Catholic epistles}}
{{Further|Authorship of the Petrine epistles|Authorship of the Johannine works}}
The catholic epistles (also called the general epistles<ref name="Enc">Encarta-encyclopedie Winkler Prins (1993–2002) s.v. "katholieke brieven". Microsoft Corporation/Het Spectrum.</ref>) are seven epistles of the New Testament. Listed in order of their appearance in the New Testament, the catholic epistles are:

== Epistles of Apostolic Fathers ==
These are letters written by some very early Christian leaders, in the 1st or 2nd century, which are not part of the [[New Testament]]. They are generally considered to form part of the basis of Christian tradition. The ennobling word "epistle" is used partly because these were all written in Greek, in a time period close to when the epistles of the New Testament were written, and thus "epistle" lends additional weight of authority.

* Epistle of the Romans to the Corinthians ([[First Epistle of Clement|1 Clement]])
* [[Epistle of Ignatius to the Ephesians]]
* [[Epistle of Ignatius to the Magnesians]]
* [[Epistle of Ignatius to the Trallians]]
* [[Epistle of Ignatius to the Romans]]
* [[Epistle of Ignatius to the Philadelphians]]
* [[Epistle of Ignatius to the Smyrnaeans]]
* [[Epistle of Ignatius to Polycarp]]
* [[Epistle of Polycarp to the Philippians]]
* [[Epistle of Barnabas]]
* [[Epistle to Diognetus]]

==Liturgical use==<!-- Epistle (liturgy) redirects here -->
[[File:Epistle to Galatians Illuminated.jpg|thumb|Opening of the Epistle to the Galatians, [[illuminated manuscript]] for reading during [[Christian liturgy]].]]
In the context of a [[liturgy]], epistle may refer more specifically to a particular passage from a New Testament epistle (the Pauline epistles and the [[General epistles]])—sometimes also from the [[Book of Acts]] or the [[Revelation of John]], but not the [[Four Gospels]]—that is scheduled to be read on a certain day or at a certain occasion.

===Western churches===
In the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] and [[Anglican Communion|Anglican]] [[Eucharist]], epistles are read between the [[Collect]] and the [[Gospel (liturgy)|Gospel]] reading. The corresponding [[Gregorian chant]]s have a special tone (''tonus epistolae''). When the epistle is sung or chanted at [[Solemn Mass]] it is done so by the [[subdeacon]]. Epistles are also read by an [[Elder (Christianity)#Lutheranism|Elder]] or [[Bishop#Lutheranism|Bishop]] in the [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] [[Divine Service (Lutheran)|Divine Service]], between the [[gradual]] and the Gospel.

===Eastern churches===
[[File:Kniga Apostol 1632 Drukarnya S Sobal.jpg|thumb|left|The ''Kniga Apostol'' (1632), [[lectionary]] in [[Church Slavonic]] for use in the [[Divine Liturgy]] of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]].]]
In the [[Divine Liturgy]] of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and the [[Byzantine Rite Catholic]]s the Epistle reading is called the ''Apostol'' (the same name is given to the [[lectionary]] from which it is read). The Apostol includes the Acts of the Apostles as well as the Epistles, but never the [[Apocalypse]] (Revelation of John). Unlike in the [[Latin liturgical rites]], there are never readings from the [[Old Testament]].<ref>{{CathEncy|wstitle=Apostle (in Liturgy)}}</ref> There are Epistle [[lection|lessons]] for every day of the year, except for weekdays during [[Great Lent]], when the Divine Liturgy is not celebrated. These daily Epistle readings are a part of the [[Paschal cycle]], being ultimately dependent upon the date of [[Easter|Pascha]] (Easter). There are also lessons appointed for the [[feast day]]s of numerous [[saint]]s and commemorations. There may be one, two, or three readings from the Apostol during a single Liturgy. The Epistle is read between the [[Prokeimenon]] and the [[Alleluia]]. The Epistle reading is always linked to a reading from the [[Gospel]], though some services, such as [[Matins]], will have a Gospel lesson, but no Epistle ([[Vespers]] on a number of feast days (typically for Apostles) will also have three epistle readings but no Gospel). A number of services besides the Divine Liturgy will have an Epistle and Gospel reading. Such services often include a Prokeimenon and Alleluia as well. The Epistle is chanted by the [[Reader (liturgy)|reader]], though at a Hierarchical Liturgy (a Divine Liturgy celebrated by a [[bishop]]), it is read by a [[deacon]]. The one who chants the Epistle also reads the verses of the [[Prokeimenon]].

==Medieval epistles==
During the [[Middle Ages]], the art of letter writing was taught in numerous manuals, and the [[ars dictaminis]] became an important genre of instructional discourse. The necessity for letter writing was in large part due to the general deterioration of civil life and the decay of the [[Roman roads|Roman road]] system in the early [[Middle Ages]], factors that obliged literate people with business to transact to send letters instead of travel themselves.<ref>{{cite book |last=Richardson |first=Malcolm |editor-first1=Carol |editor-last1 =Poster | editor-first2=Linda C. |editor-last2=Mitchell | title= Letter-Writing Manuals and Instruction from Antiquity to the Present: Historical and Bibliographic Studies |publisher=University of South Carolina Press |location= Columbia, SC |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=zGhKNwuFvlwC |date= 2007 |pages= 52–66 |chapter= The ''Art dictaminis'', the Formulary, and Medieval Epistolary Practice |isbn=978-1570036514 }}</ref> A vast number of letters and letter-writing manuals were written in the period's ''lingua franca'', [[Latin]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Poster |first1=Carol |last2=Utz |first2=Richard |editor-first1=Carol |editor-last1 =Poster | editor-first2=Linda C. |editor-last2=Mitchell | title= Letter-Writing Manuals and Instruction from Antiquity to the Present: Historical and Bibliographic Studies |publisher=University of South Carolina Press |location= Columbia, SC |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=zGhKNwuFvlwC |date= 2007 |pages= 285–300 |chapter= Appendix&nbsp;B: A Bibliography of Medieval Latin ''Dictamen'' |isbn=978-1570036514 }}</ref>
