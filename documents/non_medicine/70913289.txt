The '''debate on the "Chineseness" of the Yuan and Qing dynasties''' is concerned with whether the [[Mongols|Mongol]]-led [[Yuan dynasty]] (1271–1368) and the [[Manchu people|Manchu]]-led [[Qing dynasty]] (1636–1912) can be considered "Chinese dynasties", and whether they were representative of "China" during the respective historical periods. The debate, albeit historiographical in nature, has political implications. Mainstream academia and successive governments of China, including the imperial governments of the Yuan and Qing dynasties, have maintained the view that they were "Chinese" and representative of "China".<ref name="Yi2007">葉碧苓《九一八事變後中國史學界對日本「滿蒙論」之駁斥—以〈東北史綱〉第一卷為中心之探討》，〈國史館學術集刊〉第11期，2007-03-01，第105-142頁</ref><ref name="方萧魏">方修琦，萧凌波，魏柱灯《8～19世纪之交华北平原气候转冷的社会影响及其发生机制》，〈中国科学〉第43卷第5期，2013年</ref><ref name="黃克武">{{cite web |author1=黃克武 |title=「 中國本部 ―― 邊疆 」 的語彙轉變與國家形構|url=http://www.mh.sinica.edu.tw/gs/download/plan1/%E9%BB%83%E5%85%8B%E6%AD%A6_%E3%80%8C%E4%B8%AD%E5%9C%8B%E6%9C%AC%E9%83%A8%E2%80%95%E2%80%95%E9%82%8A%E7%96%86%E3%80%8D%E7%9A%84%E8%AA%9E%E5%BD%99%E8%BD%89%E8%AE%8A%E8%88%87%E5%9C%8B%E5%AE%B6%E5%BD%A2%E6%A7%8B.pdf |access-date=2018-07-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180731093159/http://www.mh.sinica.edu.tw/gs/download/plan1/%E9%BB%83%E5%85%8B%E6%AD%A6_%E3%80%8C%E4%B8%AD%E5%9C%8B%E6%9C%AC%E9%83%A8%E2%80%95%E2%80%95%E9%82%8A%E7%96%86%E3%80%8D%E7%9A%84%E8%AA%9E%E5%BD%99%E8%BD%89%E8%AE%8A%E8%88%87%E5%9C%8B%E5%AE%B6%E5%BD%A2%E6%A7%8B.pdf |archive-date=2018-07-31 |url-status=live }}</ref> In short, the cause of the controversy stems from the dispute in interpreting the relationship between the two concepts of "Han Chinese" and "China", because although the Chinese government recognizes 56 ethnic groups in China and the Han have a more open view of the Yuan and Qing dynasties since Liang Qichao and other royalist reformers supported the Qing dynasty, the Han are China's main ethnic group. This means that there are many opinions that equate [[Han Chinese]] people with [[China]] and lead to criticism of the legitimacy of these two dynasties.

==Background==
===Origin and development===
This debate emerged following the [[Meiji Restoration]] in Japan. In their attempt to rationalize the debate, some Japanese scholars deliberately conflated the concepts of "China" and "[[China proper]]", in the process diminishing the scope of the former. The position that the Yuan and Qing dynasties were "non-Chinese" was later adopted by some late-Qing anti-Manchu Chinese revolutionaries who had lived in Japan. [[Zhang Binglin]], for instance, in a work titled ''On the Chinese Republic'', proposed that a potential Chinese republican state to be founded in the event of a Qing collapse should only comprise regions influenced by Han culture, and that non-Han regions were outside of "China".<ref name="ZhangTaiyan">{{cite book|last1=Zhang|first1=Binglin|title=中華民國解 [On the Chinese Republic]|volume=|year=1907|url=https://zh.wikisource.org/wiki/中華民國解|quote=中國以先漢郡縣為界，而其民謂之華民。[…]故以中華民國之經界言之，越南、朝鮮二郡必當恢復者也；緬甸一司則稍次也；西藏、回部、蒙古三荒服則任其去來也。}}</ref>

Furthermore, to serve Japanese political agenda, some Japanese academics and politicians like Yano Jinichi and [[Kanji Ishiwara|Ishiwara Kanji]] made a distinction between "China" and the "Qing dynasty"; and separated [[Manchuria]], [[Inner Mongolia]], and [[Outer Mongolia]] from the territorial scope of "China" in their rhetoric to justify the [[Continental Policy (Japan)|Continental Policy]] and the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Japanese invasion of China]].<ref name="Origin1">{{cite book|last1=Ge|first1=Zhaoguang|title=宅兹中国：重建有关"中国"的历史论述|year=2011|url=|pages=252–253|isbn=}}</ref><ref name="Origin2">{{cite journal|last1=Ge|first1=Zhaoguang|year=2005|title=重建關於「中國」的歷史論述──從民族國家中拯救歷史，還是在歷史中理解民族國家?|url=http://www.cuhk.edu.hk/ics/21c/media/online/0504078.pdf|journal=二十一世紀|volume=|issue=43|pages=|access-date=23 June 2022}}</ref><ref name="Origin3">{{cite journal|last1=Chen|first1=Bo|year=2016|title=日本明治时代的中国本部概念|url=https://www.ixueshu.com/document/13b7db55e198eae3318947a18e7f9386.html|journal=学术月刊|volume=|issue=7|pages=|access-date=23 June 2022}}</ref><ref name="Origin4">{{cite journal|last1=Ye|first1=Biling|year=2007|title=九一八事變後中國史學界對日本「滿蒙論」之駁斥──以《東北史綱》第一卷為中心之探討|url=https://www.drnh.gov.tw/var/file/3/1003/img/10/232557924.pdf|journal=國史館學術集刊|volume=|issue=11|pages=105–142|access-date=23 June 2022}}</ref>

===Political significance===
Whereas there were many regimes in Chinese history that were ruled by non-Han ethnicities, the Yuan and Qing dynasties were the only two that ultimately achieved the unification of China proper. The Qing dynasty, in particular, is noted for having laid the foundation for the modern-day territories of China. Both the [[China|People's Republic of China]] and the [[Taiwan|Republic of China]] base their constitutional territorial claims on those of the Qing dynasty, in accordance with the [[succession of states]] theory. Denying the "Chineseness" of the Yuan and Qing dynasties thus threatens the territorial integrity of contemporary China. To protect Chinese national and traditional historiographical interests, Chinese historians and governments have rejected the opinion that the Yuan and Qing dynasties were "non-Chinese".<ref name="Yi2007"/><ref name="方萧魏"/><ref name="黃克武"/>

Proponents of the view that the Yuan and Qing dynasties were "non-Chinese" or "foreign" generally equate "Chinese people" with [[Han Chinese|Han people]], and "China" with the Han-dominated region of China proper. Emphasis is often given to the fact that both regimes and those who founded them did not originate from the [[Zhongyuan|Central Plain]], the cradle of Chinese civilization and the heartland of the ethnic Han. Furthermore, the rulers were ethnic minorities, whom the dominant Han people traditionally considered "barbarians", according to the [[Hua–Yi distinction|''Hua''–''Yi'' dichotomy]]. Thus, during these periods "China" should be perceived as a "colony" of the Mongols and Manchus respectively.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://culture.dwnews.com/history/big5/news/2014-11-09/59617649.html|title=蒙元滿清：科舉制度導致中國歷史上兩次亡國|author=曾節明|publisher=共識網|date=2014-11-09 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180406231036/http://culture.dwnews.com/history/big5/news/2014-11-09/59617649.html|archive-date=2018-04-06|access-date=2018-04-06}}</ref> By extension, the lands controlled by the Yuan and Qing dynasties, particularly those inhabited by significant non-Han populations, should not be regarded as historical Chinese territories.<ref name="lortie2015">Molly Lortie, [http://thetibetpost.com/zh/news/international/4706-history-is-against-china-cta-says-tibet-was-never-part-of-china 歷史不是站在中國這邊的；藏人行政中央：西藏從來就不是中國的一部分] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160809144334/http://thetibetpost.com/zh/news/international/4706-history-is-against-china-cta-says-tibet-was-never-part-of-china |date=2016-08-09 }}, Tibet Post International, 2015</ref><ref name="bbc01">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/chinese/trad/hi/newsid_1340000/newsid_1346900/1346944.stm 歷史檔案：西藏五十年] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160206131028/http://news.bbc.co.uk/chinese/trad/hi/newsid_1340000/newsid_1346900/1346944.stm |date=2016-02-06 }}, [[BBC]]中文網, 2001年05月23日</ref>

Scholars who uphold the view that both dynasties were "Chinese" find fault with the opposing group's narrow conception of "China" and "Chinese" in cultural, ethnic, and political terms. These scholars posit that "China" and "Chinese" should be best understood as multicultural and multiethnic concepts that transcend the ideological boundaries of contemporary [[ethnic nationalism]]. [[Liang Qichao]], for instance, argued that "macro-nationalism" ({{lang|zh-Hant|大民族主義}}) with its emphasis on a multicultural and multiethnic China could best explain the historical trajectories of China, as opposed to "micro-nationalism" ({{lang|zh-Hant|小民族主義}}) that foregrounded the Han people at the expense of ethnic minorities.<ref name="LiangQichao">{{cite book|last1=Zheng|first1=Huanzhao|title="诗教"传统的历史中介：梁启超与中国现代文学启蒙话语的发生|year=2017|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B0gEEAAAQBAJ&dq=%E6%A2%81%E5%90%AF%E8%B6%85+%E5%B0%8F%E6%B0%91%E6%97%8F%E4%B8%BB%E4%B9%89&pg=PA162|page=162|isbn=9787520118842}}</ref> These scholars also criticize the opposing group for [[Nationalist historiography|retroactively applying]] modern-day ideologies such as ethnic nationalism to historical peoples and regimes, resulting in distorted narratives.

The imperial governments of the Yuan and Qing dynasties maintained the view that their regimes were orthodox dynasties of China. In the ''Ultimatum from the Mongol State'' issued to the [[Emperor Kameyama]] of Japan in 1266, the [[Kublai Khan|Emperor Shizu of Yuan]] referred to the [[Mongol Empire]] using various traditional [[names of China]].<ref name="Ultimatum">{{cite book|last1=Borjigin|first1=Kublai|title=蒙古國牒状 [Ultimatum from the Mongol State]|volume=|year=1266|url=https://zh.wikisource.org/zh-hant/蒙古國牒状|quote=況我祖宗，受天明命，奄有區夏。[…]日本密邇高麗，開國以來，亦時通中國。}}</ref> In 1271, the Emperor Shizu of Yuan issued the ''Edict on the Proclamation of the Dynastic Name'', which formally claimed succession from prior Chinese regimes, from the [[Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors]] to the [[Tang dynasty]], for the entire Mongol-ruled realm and equated the Mongol Empire with the Yuan dynasty.<ref name="1271Edict">{{cite book|last1=Tudan|first1=Gonglü|title=建國號詔 [Edict on the Proclamation of the Dynastic Name]|volume=|year=1271|url=https://zh.wikisource.org/wiki/建國號詔|quote=誕膺景命，奄四海以宅尊﹔必有美名，紹百王而紀統。肇從隆古，匪獨我家。且唐之為言蕩也，堯以之而著稱﹔虞之為言樂也，舜因之而作號。馴至禹興而湯造，互名夏大以殷中，世降以還，事殊非古。雖乘時而有國，不以利而制稱。為秦為漢者，著從初起之地名﹔曰隋曰唐者，因即所封之爵邑。}}</ref><ref name="GreatYuan1">{{cite book|last1=Robinson|first1=David|title=In the Shadow of the Mongol Empire: Ming China and Eurasia|year=2019|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=itKyDwAAQBAJ&q=great+yuan+entire+mongol+empire&pg=PA50|page=50|isbn=9781108482448}}</ref><ref name="GreatYuan2">{{cite book|last1=Robinson|first1=David|title=Empire's Twilight: Northeast Asia Under the Mongols|year=2009|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PDjWpqU55eMC&q=great+yuan+refer+to+entire+mongol+empire&pg=PA293|page=293|isbn=9780674036086}}</ref><ref name="GreatYuan3">{{cite book|last1=Brook|first1=Timothy|last2=Walt van Praag|first2=Michael van|last3=Boltjes|first3=Miek|title=Sacred Mandates: Asian International Relations since Chinggis Khan|year=2018|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6p1WDwAAQBAJ&q=great+yuan+refer+to+entire+mongol+empire&pg=PA45|page=45|isbn=9780226562933}}</ref> The edict of enthronement of the [[Temür Khan|Emperor Chengzong of Yuan]] proclaimed that [[Genghis Khan]] received the [[Mandate of Heaven]] and went on to "establish China (''Quxia'')"—a traditional Chinese expression referring to the founding of a Chinese dynasty.<ref name="Yuan1">{{cite book|last1=Song|first1=Lian|title=元史 [History of Yuan]|volume=18|url=https://zh.wikisource.org/wiki/元史/卷018|quote=朕惟太祖聖武皇帝受天明命，肇造區夏，聖聖相承，光熙前緒。}}</ref> As evident from the Chinese seal bestowed by the Emperor Chengzong of Yuan to [[Öljaitü]] of the [[Ilkhanate]], seen in a letter by Öljaitü to [[Philip IV of France]] dated 1305, the Yuan dynasty officially saw itself as possessing the Mandate of Heaven in the traditional Chinese style.<ref name="Yuan2">Letter of Öljeitu to Philippe le Bel (1305).

Similarly, emperors of the Qing dynasty officially equated their empire with "China" and adopted "''Dulimbai Gurun''", [[Manchu language|Manchu]] for "''Zhongguo''" (Middle Kingdom), as a name for the state. The Qing dynasty was formally conceived as a multiethnic empire and its emperors openly rejected the idea that "Chinese" and "China" only referred to the Han people and the lands that they populated, respectively. In 1711, the [[Kangxi Emperor]] publicly proclaimed that the Manchu homeland of [[Manchuria under Qing rule|Manchuria]] was part of the "land of China (''Zhongguo'')".<ref name="Qing1">{{cite book|last1=Huang|first1=Xingtao|title=重塑中華：近代中國「中華民族」觀念研究|year=2017|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oZtaDwAAQBAJ&dq=%E8%87%AA%E5%8F%A4%E4%BB%A5%E6%9D%A5%EF%BC%8C%E7%BB%98%E8%88%86%E5%9B%BE%E8%80%85%E4%BF%B1%E4%B8%8D%E4%BE%9D%E7%85%A7%E5%A4%A9%E4%B8%8A%E4%B9%8B%E5%BA%A6%E6%95%B0%E4%BB%A5%E6%8E%A8%E7%AE%97%E5%9C%B0%E9%87%8C%E4%B9%8B%E8%BF%9C%E8%BF%91%EF%BC%8C%E6%95%85%E5%B7%AE%E8%AF%AF%E8%80%85%E5%A4%9A%E3%80%82%E6%9C%95%E5%89%8D%E7%89%B9%E5%B7%AE%E8%83%BD%E7%AE%97%E5%96%84%E7%94%BB%E4%B9%8B%E4%BA%BA%EF%BC%8C%E5%B0%86%E4%B8%9C%E5%8C%97%E4%B8%80%E5%B8%A6%E5%B1%B1%E5%B7%9D%E5%9C%B0%E9%87%8C%E4%BF%B1%E7%85%A7%E5%A4%A9%E4%B8%8A%E5%BA%A6%E6%95%B0%E6%8E%A8%E7%AE%97%EF%BC%8C%E8%AF%A6%E5%8A%A0%E7%BB%98%E5%9B%BE%E8%A7%86%E4%B9%8B%EF%BC%8C%E6%B7%B7%E5%90%8C%E6%B1%9F%E8%87%AA%E9%95%BF%E7%99%BD%E5%B1%B1%E6%B5%81%E5%87%BA%EF%BC%8C%E7%94%B1%E8%88%B9%E5%8E%82%E6%89%93%E7%89%B2%E4%B9%8C%E6%8B%89%E5%90%91%E4%B8%9C%E5%8C%97%E6%B5%81%EF%BC%8C%E4%BC%9A%E4%BA%8E%E9%BB%91%E9%BE%99%E6%B1%9F%E5%85%A5%E6%B5%B7%EF%BC%8C%E6%AD%A4%E7%9A%86%E7%B3%BB%E4%B8%AD%E5%9B%BD%E5%9C%B0%E6%96%B9%E3%80%82%E9%B8%AD%E7%BB%BF%E6%B1%9F%E8%87%AA%E9%95%BF%E7%99%BD%E5%B1%B1%E4%B8%9C%E5%8D%97%E6%B5%81%E5%87%BA%EF%BC%8C%E5%90%91%E8%A5%BF%E5%8D%97%E8%80%8C%E5%BE%80%EF%BC%8C%E7%94%B1%E5%87%A4%E5%87%B0%E5%9F%8E%E6%9C%9D%E9%B2%9C%E5%9B%BD%E4%B9%89%E5%B7%9E%E4%B8%A4%E9%97%B4%E6%B5%81%E5%85%A5%E4%BA%8E%E6%B5%B7%E3%80%82%E9%B8%AD%E7%BB%BF%E6%B1%9F%E4%B9%8B%E8%A5%BF%E5%8C%97%E7%B3%BB%E4%B8%AD%E5%9B%BD%E5%9C%B0%E6%96%B9%EF%BC%8C%E6%B1%9F%E4%B9%8B%E4%B8%9C%E5%8D%97%E7%B3%BB%E6%9C%9D%E9%B2%9C%E5%9C%B0%E6%96%B9%EF%BC%8C%E4%BB%A5%E6%B1%9F%E4%B8%BA%E7%95%8C%E3%80%82%E5%9C%9F%E9%97%A8%E6%B1%9F%E8%A5%BF%E5%8D%97%E7%B3%BB%E6%9C%9D%E9%B2%9C%E5%9C%B0%E6%96%B9%EF%BC%8C%E6%B1%9F%E4%B9%8B%E4%B8%9C%E5%8C%97%E7%B3%BB%E4%B8%AD%E5%9B%BD%E5%9C%B0%E6%96%B9%EF%BC%8C%E4%BA%A6%E4%BB%A5%E6%B1%9F%E4%B8%BA%E7%95%8C%EF%BC%8C%E6%AD%A4%E5%A4%84%E4%BF%B1%E5%B7%B2%E6%98%8E%E7%99%BD&pg=PA21|page=21|isbn=9789620438202|quote=朕前特差能算善畫之人，將東北一帶山川地里俱照天上度數推算，詳加繪圖視之，混同江自長白山流出，由船廠打牲烏拉向東北流，會於黑龍江入海，此皆係中國地方。鴨綠江自長白山東南流出，向西南而往，由鳳凰城朝鮮國義州兩間流入於海。鴨綠江之西北係中國地方，江之東南係朝鮮地方，以江為界。……土門江西南係朝鮮地方，江之東北係中國地方，亦以江為界，此處俱已明白。}}</ref> The ''Records of Great Righteousness Resolving Confusion'' issued by the [[Yongzheng Emperor]] ridiculed and objected to narratives that depicted the Qing dynasty as "non-Chinese" and "foreign".<ref name="Qing2">{{cite book|last1=Aisin Gioro|first1=Yinzhen|title=大義覺迷錄 [Records of Great Righteousness Resolving Confusion]|volume=1|url=https://zh.wikisource.org/wiki/大義覺迷錄/卷一|year=1730|quote=在逆賊等之意，徒謂本朝以滿洲之君，入為中國之主，妄生此疆彼界之私，遂故為訕謗詆譏之說耳。不知本朝之為滿洲，猶中國之有籍貫。舜為東夷之人，文王為西夷之人，曾何損於聖德乎？[…]自我朝入主中土，君臨天下，并蒙古極邊諸部落，俱歸版圖，是中國之疆土開拓廣遠，乃中國臣民之大幸，何得尚有華夷中外之分論哉！}}</ref> In official Qing parlance, "Chinese languages" (''Dulimbai gurun-i bithe'') included [[Mandarin (late imperial lingua franca)|Mandarin]], Manchu, and [[Classical Mongolian language|Mongolian]];

The view that both dynasties were "non-Chinese" is rejected by mainstream academia, as well as the governments of the People's Republic of China and the Republic of China.<ref name="Yi2007"/><ref name="方萧魏"/><ref name="黃克武"/> ''[[The Historical Atlas of China]]'', one of the most authoritative works on Chinese historical geography, considered both dynasties to be "Chinese" alongside other polities ruled by non-Han ethnicities. As part of their efforts to maintain Chinese historiographical tradition and make known the official position regarding the nature of the Yuan and Qing dynasties, the Republic of China has published the ''New History of Yuan'', the ''[[Draft History of Qing]]'', and the ''History of Qing''; whereas the People's Republic of China has also commissioned its version of the ''History of Qing''.
