'''Anonymous works''' are works, such as [[art]] or [[literature]], that have an [[Anonymity|anonymous]], undisclosed, or unknown creator or author. In the case of very old works, the author's name may simply be lost over the course of history and time. There are a number of reasons anonymous works arise.

== Description ==
In the [[United States]], anonymous work is legally defined as "a work on the copies or [[phonorecord]]s of which no [[natural person]] is identified as [[author]]."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/property/library/copyrightact.html|title=Selected Sections of the Copyright Act|date=1997-12-17|access-date=2008-06-22|work=United States Code Annotated|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511185159/http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/property/library/copyrightact.html|archive-date=11 May 2008 |url-status=live}}</ref>

== Explanations ==
In the case of very old works, the author's name may simply be lost over the course of history and time. In such cases the author is often referred to as [[Wikt:anonymus|Anonymus]], the [[Latin]]  form of "anonymous". In other cases, the creator's name is intentionally kept secret. The author's reasons may vary from fear of [[persecution]] to protection of his or her reputation. Legal reasons may also bar an author from self-identifying.{{cn|date=August 2013}} An author may also wish to remain anonymous to avoid becoming famous for their work.
