The '''USA Gymnastics sex abuse scandal''' relates to the [[sexual abuse]] of gymnasts—primarily minors at the time of the abuse—over two decades in the United States, starting in the 1990s. More than 500 athletes alleged that they were sexually assaulted "by gym owners, coaches, and staff working for gymnastics programs across the country", including [[USA Gymnastics]] (USAG) and [[Michigan State University]] (MSU).<ref name=":2" /><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/gvqm7y/skandal-u-americkoj-gimnastici-deca-zlostavljana-20-godina|title=New Report Reveals 20-Year Sex Abuse Scandal Across US Gymnastics Programs|last=Messman|first=Lauren|date=December 15, 2016|publisher=[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]|language=en|access-date=February 17, 2018|quote=At least 368 child gymnasts have alleged sexual assault by gym owners, coaches, and staff working for top gymnastics programs across the country over the last 20 years.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=Evans |first1=Tim |last2=Alesia |first2=Mark |last3=Kwiatkowski |first3=Marisa |date=15 December 2016 |title=A 20-year toll: 368 gymnasts allege sexual exploitation |url=https://www.indystar.com/story/news/2016/12/15/20-year-toll-368-gymnasts-allege-sexual-exploitation/95198724/ |access-date=February 17, 2018 |publisher=[[The Indianapolis Star]] |language=en |quote=At least 368 gymnasts have alleged some form of sexual abuse at the hands of their coaches, gym owners and other adults working in gymnastics.

The abuses were first reported in September 2016 by ''[[The Indianapolis Star]]'', whose nine-month investigation found that the abuses were widespread because "predatory coaches were allowed to move from gym to gym, undetected by a lax system of oversight, or dangerously passed on by USA Gymnastics-certified gyms".<ref name="TIS2016">{{cite web |author=Evans |first1=Tim |last2=Alesia |first2=Mark |last3=Kwiatkowski |first3=Marisa |date=15 December 2016 |title=A 20-year toll: 368 gymnasts allege sexual exploitation |url=https://www.indystar.com/story/news/2016/12/15/20-year-toll-368-gymnasts-allege-sexual-exploitation/95198724/ |access-date=February 17, 2018 |publisher=[[The Indianapolis Star]] |language=en}}</ref> Coaches and officials perpetrated, facilitated, or worked to conceal abuse in Michigan, Pennsylvania, California, Rhode Island, Indiana, and elsewhere.<ref name="TIS2016" /> [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agents declined to investigate early allegations of abuse, then lied about it, according to a [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Justice Department]] report. Leaders of USAG, MSU, and the [[United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee|United States Olympic Committee]] (USOC, later USOPC) ultimately resigned; several coaches and officials faced criminal charges.

A central figure was [[Larry Nassar]], a national-team doctor for USAG and [[osteopathic physician]] in MSU's athletic department. More than 265 women said Nassar had sexually abused them under the pretense of providing medical treatment,<ref name="hundreds">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-42894833|title=Larry Nassar case: USA Gymnastics doctor 'abused 265 girls'|work=BBC News|date=January 31, 2018}}</ref> including former [[United States women's national gymnastics team|USAG national team]] members [[Jessica Howard]], [[Jamie Dantzscher]], [[Morgan White (gymnast)|Morgan White]], [[Jeanette Antolin]], [[McKayla Maroney]], [[Aly Raisman]], [[Maggie Nichols (gymnast)|Maggie Nichols]], [[Gabby Douglas]], [[Simone Biles]], [[Jordyn Wieber]], [[Sabrina Vega]], [[Ashton Locklear]], [[Kyla Ross]], [[Madison Kocian]], [[Amanda Jetter]], [[Tasha Schwikert]], [[Mattie Larson]], [[Bailie Key]], [[Kennedy Baker]], [[Alyssa Baumann]], and [[Terin Humphrey]]. In 2017 and 2018, Nassar pleaded guilty to federal charges of child pornography and state charges of first-degree sexual assault; he received sentences of 60 years in prison plus another 80 to 300 years.

The scandal led to the [[Protecting Young Victims from Sexual Abuse and Safe Sport Authorization Act of 2017]], which directed the creation of the [[U.S. Center for SafeSport]].

In 2018, MSU agreed to pay $500 million to settle lawsuits accusing university leaders, including its president and athletic director, of enabling Nassar's abuse.<ref name=":3" /><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/national-international/Larry-Nassar-Fallout-Michigan-State-US-Olympic-Committee-USA-Gymnastics-470969223.html|title=Michigan State President Resigns; US Olympic Committee Face Fallout of Larry Nassar Sentencing|work=NBC Chicago|date=January 24, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-nassar-accountability-20180124-story.html|title=Michigan State University president resigns amid widening calls for accountability over Larry Nassar abuse scandal|work=Los Angeles Times|date=January 24, 2018|first=Matt|last=Pearce}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2018/01/15/us/larry-nassar-gymnastics-me-too-sentence/index.html|title=Larry Nassar's sexual abuse victims finally get their days in court|work=CNN|date=January 15, 2018|first=Eric|last=Levenson}}</ref><ref name="chicagotri">{{cite web|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/international/ct-usa-gymnastics-fbi-doctor-abuse-20170216-story.html|title=USA Gymnastics alerted FBI in 2015 to doctor accused of abuse|work=Chicago Tribune|date=February 16, 2017|first1=Rick|last1=Maese|first2=Will|last2=Hobson}}</ref><ref name="nytsteve">{{cite web |last=Branch |first=John |date=March 16, 2017 |title=Steve Penny Resigns as U.S.A.

In 2021, the USOPC and USAG settled lawsuits brought by more than 500 athletes for $380 million.

==Background==
Since 1990, USA Gymnastics has kept a list of people permanently banned from coaching for sexual abuse and other reasons. For example, the list includes Robert Dean Head, a USAG coach in Kentucky who in 1992 pled guilty to raping a 12-year-old, and [[Don Peters]], the national coach for the [[Gymnastics at the 1984 Summer Olympics|1984 Olympic team]], who was banned in 2011 after two former gymnasts accused him of sexual abuse. In 2007, USAG began requiring background checks for coaches.<ref>{{Cite web |title=USA Gymnastics {{!}} Permanently Ineligible Members and Participants |url=https://usagym.org/pages/aboutus/pages/permanently_ineligible_members.html |access-date=2021-05-08 |website=usagym.org}}</ref>

Yet USAG leaders also routinely dismissed warnings about coaches. For example, USAG received complaints about coach Mark Schiefelbein long before he was convicted in 2003 of molesting a 10-year-old girl.<ref>{{Cite news |date=October 2, 2003 |title=Former gymnastics coach receives 96-year sentence - The Associated Press |work=The Oak Ridger (TN)}}</ref> Similarly, USAG received complaints about coach James Bell at least five years before he was jailed in 2003 for molesting three young gymnasts.<ref name="dayton" /><ref>{{Cite news |last=Rapp |first=Timothy |date=August 4, 2016 |title=USA Gymnastics Allegedly Failed to Alert Authorities to Sexual Abuse Allegations |language=en |work=Bleacher Report |url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2655799-usa-gymnastics-allegedly-failed-to-alert-authorities-to-sexual-abuse-allegations |access-date=2023-07-12}}</ref> In a 2013 lawsuit, USAG officials admitted under oath that allegations of sexual abuse were routinely dismissed as hearsay unless they came directly from a victim or victim's parent.

Even when USAG leaders believed the accusers, they sometimes allowed coaches to continue coaching for years. For example, they waited four years before telling the police that they had received credible allegations of sexual assault by Marvin Sharp, who became a USAG coach in 2010. Sharp was charged in 2015 with three counts of child molestation and four counts of sexual misconduct with a minor; he died by suicide in prison.

At least four complaints were made against [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] coach William McCabe, but USAG did not report the allegations to the police. One gym owner had warned that McCabe "should be locked in a cage before someone is raped".<ref name=dayton/> McCabe continued coaching for seven years until one gymnast's mother went to the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) with emails that he sent to her 11-year-old daughter. McCabe was charged with molesting gymnasts, secretly videotaping girls changing clothes, and posting their nude images on the Internet. He pleaded guilty and is serving a 30-year sentence.<ref name="dayton">{{Cite news |last1=Kwiatkowski |first1=Marisa |last2=Alesia |first2=Mark |last3=Star |first3=Evans |date=August 4, 2016 |title=A BLIND EYE TO SEX ABUSE; How USA Gymnastics Protected Coaches over Kids by Failing to Report Allegations of Misconduct |work=Dayton Daily News (Dayton, OH) |url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-39900495.html |url-status=dead |access-date=February 4, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180205000957/https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-39900495.html |archive-date=February 5, 2018}}</ref>

The released documents included a letter which says a USAG regional chair spoke to the organization's president in support of allowing a convicted sex offender to keep his membership. Other documents include sexual abuse complaints that were filed against 54 coaches. The documents revealed that some of these coaches were not banned from the sport even after being convicted of the crimes. USAG has since said that it has banned 37 of the 54 coaches.<ref>{{Cite news |last1=Kwiatkowski |first1=Marisa |last2=Evans |first2=Tim |last3=Alesia |first3=Mark |last4= |first4= |date=March 5, 2017 |title=Judge Releases USA Gymnastics Sex Abuse Files |work=Dayton Daily News (Dayton, OH) |url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-40514599.html |url-status=dead |access-date=February 4, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180205000952/https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-40514599.html |archive-date=February 5, 2018 }}</ref>

According to those reports, Nassar committed sexual assaults during medical examinations and purported treatments. The molestations ranged from his inserting a finger into the gymnasts' vaginas and anuses to fondling their breasts and genitalia. These were criminal acts regardless of consent since the victims were minors. Nassar initially denied the charges, claiming that he was performing legitimate medical procedures.<ref name=chicagotri/> In February 2017, three former gymnasts—[[Jeanette Antolin]], [[Jessica Howard]], and [[Jamie Dantzscher]]—gave an interview with ''[[60 Minutes]]'' in which they accused Nassar of sexually abusing them. The gymnasts also alleged that the "emotionally abusive environment" at the national team training camps run by [[Béla Károlyi|Béla]] and [[Márta Károlyi]] at the [[Karolyi Ranch]] near [[Huntsville, Texas]], gave Nassar an opportunity to take advantage of the gymnasts and made them afraid to speak up about the abuse.<ref name=60mins>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/on-60-minutes-former-gymnasts-allege-sexual-abuse/|title=On 60 Minutes, former gymnasts allege sexual abuse|work=CBS News|date=February 19, 2017|first=Brit|last=McCandless}}</ref> Rachael Denhollander, one of the first women to publicly accuse Nassar,<ref name=nyt1/> said in court in May 2017 that Nassar sexually abused her on five doctor's visits in 2000 when she was 15 years old.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/05/13/us/michigan-gymnastics-doctor-sexual-abuse-allegations/index.html|title=Doctor's accuser: 'I froze, because I knew it was sexual abuse'|author1=Steve Almasy|author2=Anne Woolsey|work=CNN|date=May 14, 2017|access-date=December 4, 2017}}</ref>

In 2018, several other state and federal agencies investigated Michigan State's involvement, including the Michigan Attorney General's office<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mlive.com/news/index.ssf/2018/01/6_questions_schuette_didnt_ans.html|title=7 questions AG Bill Schuette needs to answer about his Michigan State investigation|date=January 28, 2018}}</ref> and the [[US Department of Education]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Wermund |first=Benjamin |date=2018-02-26 |title=DeVos announces new Title IX probe at Michigan State |url=http://politi.co/2EWM7fk |website=POLITICO}}</ref>

As a result of the Michigan Attorney General's investigation, in March 2018, Strampel, who oversaw Nassar's clinic while dean of the [[Michigan State University College of Osteopathic Medicine|College of Osteopathic Medicine]], was arrested and charged with felony misconduct in office and criminal sexual conduct for allegedly groping a student and storing nude photos on his computer. Strampel also possessed a video of the pelvic floor manipulation procedure that Larry Nassar had created as a training video. The video may constitute evidence of an assault, and the investigation is continuing.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/dean-william-strampel-michigan-state-university-arrested-larry-nassar-probe-arraignment-today/|title=William Strampel, former Michigan State University Dean, accused of storing nude photos|date=March 27, 2018|work=CBS News}}</ref> On June 9, 2018, six current or former Michigan State employees linked to Nassar became the subjects of an investigation by Michigan's Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs.<ref name="ls">{{cite news|last1=Mencarini|first1=Matt|title=6 current, former MSU employees with ties to Nassar scandal under state licensing inquiries|url=https://www.lansingstatejournal.com/story/news/local/2018/06/08/larry-nassar-michigan-state-licensing-inquiries-strampel-hadden-teachnor-hauk-dietzel-stollak-msu/684359002/|access-date=June 10, 2018|work=Lansing State Journal|date=June 8, 2018|language=en}}</ref>

===Congress===
[[United States Congress|Congress]] responded to the sexual abuse claims made against Nassar and also to claims made against personnel who were involved with [[USA Swimming]] and [[USA Taekwondo]].

On March 28, 2017, the [[Senate Judiciary Committee]] held a hearing about the bill. Former gymnasts [[Dominique Moceanu]], [[Jamie Dantzscher]], and Jessica Howard testified.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/former-usa-gymnasts-address-senators-at-hearing-on-young-athletes-and-abuse/|title=Olympic stars testify to Congress about sex abuse at USA Gymnastics program|work=CBS News|date=March 28, 2017}}</ref><ref name="nytimessenate">{{cite web |last=Macur |first=Juliet |date=March 29, 2017 |title=Facing Congress, Some Sports Officials (Not All) Begin to Confront Sexual Abuse |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/29/sports/facing-congress-some-sports-officials-not-all-begin-to-confront-sex-abuse.html |url-access=limited |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210603012710/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/29/sports/facing-congress-some-sports-officials-not-all-begin-to-confront-sex-abuse.html |archive-date=3 June 2021 |work=The New York Times}}</ref> Rick Adams, chief of Paralympic sports for the [[United States Olympic Committee|USOC]] and head of organizational development for the NGBs, said at the hearing, "We do take responsibility, and we apologize to any young athlete who has ever faced abuse." USAG officials declined requests to testify at the hearing.<ref name="nytimessenate" />

Later that year, a bipartisan group of U.S. senators, including Sens. [[Dianne Feinstein]], [[John Thune]], and others, introduced a bill to require [[United States Olympic Committee#National Governing Body members|national governing body]] members overseeing Olympic sports to immediately report sexual assault allegations to law enforcement or to child-welfare agencies designated by the [[US Department of Justice|U.S. Department of Justice]].<ref>{{cite web |date=March 6, 2017 |title=Senators Introduce Bill Requiring U.S. Amateur Athletic Organizations, Members to Report Sexual Abuse |url=https://www.feinstein.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?id=DFAC8B0E-AB09-4176-8D74-B9D803CFAB2B |website=feinstein.senate.gov}}</ref> The bill amended the [[Amateur Sports Act of 1978|Ted Stevens Olympic and Amateur Sports Act]], under the Commerce Committee's jurisdiction, to expand the purposes of USOC to promote a safe environment in sports that is free from abuse.<ref>{{cite web |date=January 20, 2018 |title=Thune and Nelson Statements on Passage of Safe Sport Authorization |url=https://www.commerce.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2018/1/thune-and-nelson-statements-on-passage-of-safe-sport-authorization |website=Senate Commerce Committee Press Release}}</ref> Dubbed the [[Protecting Young Victims from Sexual Abuse and Safe Sport Authorization Act of 2017]], a bipartisan bill sponsored by Senators Feinstein and [[John Thune]] and others, it was agreed to in the House of Representatives on January 29, 2018,<ref>{{USCongRec|2018|H640}}{{Cite web|title=29 January 2018 Comments on S. 534 as amended|pages=[https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CREC-2018-01-29/pdf/CREC-2018-01-29.pdf#page=11 H636]—H643 |url=https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CREC-2018-01-29/pdf/CREC-2018-01-29.pdf#page=11|quote=[[Sheila Jackson Lee|Ms. JACKSON LEE]]...However, I must note a concern with a change the bill before us would make to the Senate-passed version of S. 534.

Among other things, the law directs the creation of a body to ensure that aspiring U.S. Olympic athletes can report allegations of abuse to an independent and non-conflicted entity for investigation and resolution, and to make sure that all national governing bodies follow the strictest standards for child abuse prevention and detection. The [[U.S. Center for SafeSport]] was duly created in 2017.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Mitten |first1=Matthew J. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BmrBDwAAQBAJ&dq=United+States+Center+for+SafeSport&pg=PA841 |title=Sports Law and Regulation: Cases, Materials, and Problems |last2=Davis |first2=Timothy |last3=Smith |first3=Rodney K. |last4=Shropshire |first4=Kenneth L. |date=2019-11-13 |publisher=Aspen Publishing |isbn=978-1-5438-1713-3 |language=en |author-link3=Rodney K.

===FBI failure to investigate and false statements===
The FBI failed to launch formal investigations into allegations that Nassar was abusing gymnasts; when asked about this, certain FBI officials lied and tried to cover up their failures, according to a report released in July 2021 by the Office of the [[Inspector general|Inspector General]] of the [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Department of Justice]] (DOJ IG).<ref>{{Cite web |date=July 2021 |title=Investigation and Review of the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Handling of Allegations of Sexual Abuse by Former USA Gymnastics Physician Lawrence Gerard Nassar |url=https://oig.justice.gov/sites/default/files/reports/21-093.pdf |website=U.S. Department of Justice}}</ref> As ''[[USA Today]]'' put it, "For more than a year, complaints to the FBI went unanswered and Nassar continued treating—and raping—gymnasts at MSU, a high school in Michigan, and a gymnastics club in Michigan."<ref>{{cite news |last1=Hackney |first1=Suzette |date=July 14, 2021 |title=FBI allows sexual predator Nassar to go unchecked.

In 2015, USAG president Stephen Penny told local FBI agents in Indianapolis that three gymnasts said they were assaulted by Nassar. The FBI did not open a formal investigation or inform federal or state authorities in Michigan. In 2016, FBI agents in Los Angeles began a sexual tourism investigation against Nassar and interviewed several victims but also didn't alert Michigan authorities.<ref>{{Cite web |last=WTHR.com staff |date=March 30, 2023 |title=FBI director addresses failures in Nassar case during Indianapolis stop |url=https://www.wthr.com/article/news/crime/fbi-director-addresses-failures-larry-nassar-case-during-indianapolis-stop-usa-gymnastics-biles-raisman-maroney-sue-settlement/531-60daed07-20dd-41a3-9e31-9c3892a0d432 |access-date=2023-10-25 |website=wthr.com |language=en-US}}</ref>

Between the time the FBI was told of Nassar's abuses and his arrest by MSU police in fall 2016, he abused more athletes—estimates range from at least 70, according to the DOJ IG report; and 120, according to Nassar's victims.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Sneed |first1=Tierney |date=September 15, 2021 |title=McKayla Maroney: FBI made 'entirely false claims about what I said' |work=[[CNN]] |url=https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/15/politics/gymnasts-senate-judiciary-committee-larry-nassar-hearing/index.html |access-date=16 September 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Naylor |first1=Brian |date=September 15, 2021 |title=Gymnasts Blast The FBI's Mishandling Of Their Allegations About Larry Nassar |work=[[NPR]] |url=https://www.npr.org/2021/09/15/1036968966/gymnasts-nassar-fbi-senate-hearing-simone-biles-aly-raisman-wray |access-date=16 September 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Barrett |first=Devlin |date=September 16, 2021 |title=Simone Biles to Congress: 'I blame Larry Nassar, and I also blame an entire system' |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/gymnasts-nassar-fbi-investigation-hearing/2021/09/14/de4832cc-159f-11ec-9589-31ac3173c2e5_story.html |url-status=live |url-access=subscription |access-date=16 September 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220120194228/https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/gymnasts-nassar-fbi-investigation-hearing/2021/09/14/de4832cc-159f-11ec-9589-31ac3173c2e5_story.html |archive-date=20 January 2022}}</ref>

The report said that FBI agent William Jay Abbott had failed to act on the gymnasts' allegations, and later lied about doing so. The report further alleged that USAG's Penny had discussed finding Abbott a job at USA Gymnastics, while telling Abbott his concerns about the bad publicity that would be generated by the scandal.<ref>{{cite news |last=Evans |first=Tim |date=16 July 2021 |title=Indianapolis FBI leader eyed head USA Gymnastics job after sitting on Nassar allegations |work=[[The Indianapolis Star]] |location= |url=https://www.indystar.com/story/news/investigations/2021/07/16/larry-nassar-usa-gymnastics-fbi-investigation-doj-job-report/7977052002/ |access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Brock |first=Kevin |date=17 September 2021 |title=Did the FBI ignore crimes against young Olympic gymnasts on purpose? |work=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]] |location= |url=https://thehill.com/opinion/criminal-justice/572731-did-the-fbi-ignore-crimes-against-young-olympic-gymnasts-on-purpose/ |access-date=}}</ref>

Two months after the DOD IG report was released in July 2021, gymnasts Maroney, Biles, Nichols, and Raisman testified to the U.S. Senate that FBI agents had mishandled their allegations against Nassar, that the agents had lied about their reports, and that they had spread misinformation about the botched investigation. Maroney testified that she was met with silence by an FBI agent after telling the agent of Nassar's "molestations in extreme detail". She said that the FBI falsified her statement and that the agents involved should be indicted; she also criticized [[United States Deputy Attorney General|Deputy Attorney General]] [[Lisa Monaco]] for not appearing at the hearing. Raisman testified that the FBI made her feel her "abuse didn't count" and "[I]t was like serving innocent children up to a pedophile on a silver platter." FBI Director [[Christopher A. Wray|Christopher Wray]] testified after the gymnasts, telling them that he was "deeply and profoundly sorry that so many people let you down over and over again".

In April and June 2022, 103 victims of Nassar sued the FBI for a total of $1.13 billion under the [[Federal Tort Claims Act]] for the FBI's false statements and inaction. In May 2022, the Department of Justice refused to arrest any FBI agent that was involved in the failure to investigate for 14 months.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Bieler |first=Des |date=2022-04-22 |title=Larry Nassar victims seek $130 million from FBI for mishandling case |language=en-US |newspaper=Washington Post |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2022/04/22/larry-nassar-fbi-claims/ |access-date=2023-07-17 |issn=0190-8286}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |title=Gymnasts sue FBI for $1 billion over mishandling of Larry Nassar case |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2022/06/08/larry-nassar-victims-fbi-lawsuit/ |access-date=2023-07-17 |newspaper=The Washington Post}}</ref>
