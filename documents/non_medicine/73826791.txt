'''Literature in [[Interlingue]] '''has existed since the language's creation in 1922 by [[Edgar de Wahl]] in 1922. Although largely composed of original [[Short story|short stories]] and translations published in the central magazine of the language, ''Cosmoglotta'', full length [[novel]]s and [[poetry anthologies]] also exist, in particular those by authors such as {{Ill|Vicente Costalago|ie}}, {{Ill|Jan Amos Kajš|ie|4=eo}}, and {{Ill|Jaroslav Podobský|ie|4=eo}}.

According to [[Spaniards|Spanish]] Occidentalist Vicente Costalago, the history of literature in the language can be broadly divided into four sections:<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal |last=Costalago |first=Vicente |date=July 2022 |title=Literatura in Interlingue |journal=[[Cosmoglotta]] |issue=329 |pages=2–15}}</ref>

* First period (1921—1927): Early literature from the creation of the language until the relocation of the language's central authority to [[Vienna]].
* Vienna era (1927—1949): Literature from the relocation to Vienna until the language's name change from ''Occidental'' to ''Interlingue.''
* Period of stagnation (1950—1999): From Interlingue's name change until the creation of the first [[Yahoo! Groups|Yahoo! Group]].
* Internet Revival (1999—): Literature from the first Yahoo! Group onwards.

== Early literature (1921—1927) ==
The first known publication in Interlingue is the book ''Transcendent algebra, mathematical [[ideography]], experiment of a [[philosophical language]]'' (Interlingue: {{Lang|ie|Transcendent algebra, ideografie matematical, experiment de un lingue filosofic}}) by Estonian linguist [[Jakob Linzbach]],<ref name=":0" /> a proposal for a [[pasigraphy]].<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Moret |first=Sébastien |date=2019 |title=Jakob Linzbach on his life and work |url=https://www.academia.edu/78129503/Jakob_Linzbach_on_his_life_and_work |journal=Sign Systems Studies |volume=47 |issue=1/2 |pages=305 |issn=1736-7409}}</ref> However, due to it being a work of [[non-fiction]], it was not the first example of literature in Interlingue.

Instead, the first work of literature was "Hymn" (''"Hymne"'') by the Finnish journalist and write {{Ill|Kaarlo Hammar|fi|Kaarlo Terhi}}, which was translated from the Finnish by K. J. Saarinen in ''[[Kosmoglott]]'' 1925.<ref name=":0" />

The following work of literature appeared in the [[Supplement (publishing)|supplement]] to ''Kosmoglott 1'' (1926). This edition had the scope of publishing both scientific and literary texts. In the first issue were translations of two works by [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], translated by A. Toman: the 48th verse{{Efn|Although in the article it was mistakenly printed as the 54th chapter , it was the 48th verse of the text.}} of ''Vier Jahreszeiten'' (English: Four Seasons), and both of the ''[[Wanderer's Nightsong]]'' poems.

Toman also translated poems by the Czech [[Nobel Laureate in Literature|Nobel Laureate]] poet [[Jaroslav Vrchlický]]. In 1926 Toman published ''Nationalism in Occidente'', the first chapter of the 1918 book Nationalism by Bengali poet [[Rabindranath Tagore]].<ref name=":0" />

== Vienna era (1927-1949) ==
The second period of the history of Interlingue literature was that beginning in Vienna, starting in 1927 and ending in 1949 when the language's name was changed to ''Interlingue''. In ''Supplement al Cosmoglotta 7'' (1927), a translation of work by Persian poet [[Saadi Shirazi]] was presented, alongside work by [[Hermann Keyserling]] in the following edition in 1927.

A series of translations were published in the 1930s, including [[Konstantin Balmont]]'s ''Where is my home?'', ''Manuel Menendez'' by [[Edmondo De Amicis]], and [[A Descent into the Maelström]] by [[Edgar Allan Poe]]. Additionally, several original works were published, such as a poetry anthology, ''Li Astres del Verne'' (''The Planets of Spring''), by Podobský, ''Krasina, raconta del subterrania del Moravian carst'' by Kajš, and several works by {{Ill|A. E. Cortinas|ie}} and P. Dimitriev. A [[short story collection]], ''Historiettes in Occidental'', was published in 1930 by [[Ric Berger]].<ref name=":0" />

== Stagnation (1950—1999) ==
[[File:Un_Adío,_de_Arvid_Brenner,_traductet_in_1958_per_Eric_Ahlström.jpg|right|thumb|262x262px|''Un Adío'' (''A Goodbye''), by {{Ill|Arvid Brenner|sv}}, translated in 1958 by Eric Ahlström.]]
The period of stagnation began in 1950, when the {{Ill|Occidental-Union|ie}} voted to change the name ''Occidental'' to ''Interlingue'', with 91% support, ending in 1999 when the first Interlingue-language Yahoo! Group was created.{{Citation needed|date=May 2023}}

In 1951, with the creation of [[Interlingua]], many occidentalists, including Berger, one of the most important figures of the Interlingue movement, began to support this new IALA language. This led to a large destabilisation of the movement, and while ''Cosmoglotta'' continued to be published, it did so with dimishing frequency, ceasing publication in 1985. According to Esperantist author [[Don Harlow]], the editor of ''Cosmoglotta'' in this period, {{Ill|Adrian Pilgrim|ie}} stated that Interlingue could be described as a "[[dead language]]".{{Citation needed|date=May 2023}}

However, publications of new literature in Interlingue continued throughout the 1950s and the early 1960s, with translations including "A Mother Speaks" by Czech [[Jiří Marek]] in 1954,  [[Multatuli|Multatuli's]] "''The alocution to the bosses of [[Lebak]]''", and "{{Ill|Wedding Shirt|cz|Svatební košile}}" by [[Karel Jaromír Erben]], translated by Josef Křesina.

Other translated books included Arvid Brenner's ''Un Adío'' (''A Farewell'') and [[Bo Bergman|Bo Bergman's]] ''A Desertor'' by Eric Ahlström in 1958. In 1964, {{Ill|Francis R. Pope|ie}} published ''Poemas'' (''Poems''), an anthology consisting of poems translated from German, French, and English.<ref name=":0" />

== Internet revival (1999—) ==
[[File:Cosmoglotta 326.jpg|thumb|A modern edition of ''Cosmoglotta''.]]
The [[History of Interlingue#Stagnation and revival|revival of Interlingue]] began in 1999 with the creation of a [[Yahoo!]] group for the language, after a decade of decay in the 1980s and 1990s. In the early 2000s, [[Interlingue Wikipedia]] was created, which had over 5000 articles in 2020.<ref name=":0" />

Many original Interlingue texts as well as translations have been published since 2000, with the first being [[Stendhal|Stendhal's]] [[The Charterhouse of Parma]] (''Li Cartusie de Parma''), translated by Robert Winter in 2011. In 2012, Thomas Schmidt published ''Li Munde de Sandra'' in an [[online magazine]], ''Posta Mundi'', which contains material published in [[constructed language]]s. This was followed with a translation of [[The Little Prince]] in 2014.

Between 2021 and 2023, Spanish author Vicente Costalago wrote several poetry anthologies, short story collections, and novellas in Interlingue, including {{Ill|Li sercha in li castelle Dewahl e altri racontas|ie}}, {{Ill|Li tresor de Fluvglant|ie}}, {{Ill|Antologie hispan|ie}}, and {{Ill|Fabules, racontas e mites|ie}}.<ref name=":0" />
