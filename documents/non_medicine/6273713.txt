'''Frederick Lorz''' (June 5, 1884 &ndash; February 4, 1914) was an American [[road running|long distance runner]] who won the 1905 [[Boston Marathon]].<ref name="A New Marathon">{{cite news |title=A New Marathon Champion: Frederick Lorz of the Mohawk Athletic Club of New York Captured the Great Run in an Exciting Contest |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=xiE0AAAAIBAJ&sjid=Y-EIAAAAIBAJ&pg=5389%2C2959792 |newspaper=Boston Evening Transcript |location=Boston |date=April 20, 1905 |page=4 |access-date=February 9, 2011 }}</ref> Lorz is also known for his "finish" in the [[Athletics at the 1904 Summer Olympics – Men's marathon|marathon at the 1904 Summer Olympics]] for not having crossed the "half-way mark" and still winning.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.olympedia.org/athletes/78716 |title=Frederick Lorz |work=Olympedia |access-date=January 17, 2021}}</ref>

==Biography==
Born in [[New York City]], Lorz was reported to have done all his training at night due to his profession as a [[bricklayer]].<ref name="A New Marathon"/>

An announcement in the August 6, 1904 issue of ''[[The New York Times]]'' indicated that the Metropolitan Association of the [[Amateur Athletic Union]] would hold a "special seven-mile race" at Celtic Park on August 13, 1904 with the eight top finishers receiving a paid trip to compete in the marathon at the Olympic Games in St. Louis on August 30, 1904.<ref name="The New York Times-August 6, 1904">{{cite news |title=WILL RUN FOR ST.

In the marathon at the 1904 Olympic Games, Lorz stopped running because of exhaustion after nine miles (14.5&nbsp;km). His manager gave him a lift in his car and drove the next eleven miles (17.7&nbsp;km), after which, Lorz continued on foot back to the Olympic stadium, where he broke the finishing line tape and was greeted as the winner of the race.

After spectators claimed he had not run the entire race, Lorz was confronted by furious officials with these allegations, upon which he admitted his deception:  despite his claims he was joking, the [[Amateur Athletic Union|AAU]] responded by banning him for life, but he was reinstated after a year after it was found that he had not intended to defraud. Lorz then legitimately won the Boston Marathon in 1905 with a time of 2:38:25.<ref>[[Boston Athletic Association]].

Lorz was suspended a second time by the Amateur Athletic Union for participating in an unsanctioned meet at the games of the Thomas Jefferson Club at Witzel's Grove, [[College Point, Queens|College Point]], [[Long Island]], [[New York City|New York]] on August 23, 1905.<ref>"Amateur Athletes Disqualified," ''The New York Times, A''ugust 25, 1905, p. 4; "A.

He finished second at the [[Yonkers Marathon]] in 1907, seventh at the [[Boston Marathon]] in 1908, sixth at the [[Empire City Marathon]] in [[Yonkers, New York|Yonkers]] in 1909, and second in another marathon in [[Boston]] nine days later.

In 1910 he married Dorothy Reilly, and they had three children. Lorz died in 1914 of pneumonia.
