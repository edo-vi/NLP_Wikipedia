<!-- Definition and symptoms -->
'''Chronic traumatic encephalopathy''' ('''CTE''') is a [[Neurodegeneration|neurodegenerative disease]] linked to repeated trauma to the head.

==Signs and symptoms==
Symptoms of CTE, which occur in four stages, generally appear eight to ten years after an individual experiences repetitive mild traumatic brain injuries.<ref name="pmid19535999">{{cite journal |vauthors=[[Ann McKee|McKee AC]], Cantu RC, [[Christopher Nowinski|Nowinski CJ]], Hedley-Whyte ET, Gavett BE, Budson AE, Santini VE, Lee HS, Kubilus CA, Stern RA |title=Chronic traumatic encephalopathy in athletes: progressive tauopathy after repetitive head injury |journal=J Neuropathol Exp Neurol |volume=68 |issue=7 |pages=709–35 |year=2009 |pmid=19535999 |pmc=2945234 |doi= 10.1097/NEN.0b013e3181a9d503}}</ref>

First-stage symptoms are [[confusion]], [[disorientation]], [[dizziness]], and headaches. Second-stage symptoms include [[memory loss]], social instability, [[impulsive behavior]], and poor judgment. Third and fourth stages include progressive [[dementia]], [[movement disorders]], [[hypomimia]], [[speech impediments]], [[sensory processing disorder]], [[tremor]]s, [[vertigo]], [[deafness]], [[Major depressive disorder|depression]] and [[suicidal ideation|suicidality]].<ref name="pmid31333567">{{cite journal |vauthors=Fesharaki-Zadeh A |title=Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy: A Brief Overview |journal= Frontiers in Neurology|volume=10 |page=713 |year=2019 |pmid=31333567 |pmc=6616127 |doi= 10.3389/fneur.2019.00713|doi-access=free }}</ref>

==Pathology==
The [[Neuropathology|neuropathological]] appearance of CTE is distinguished from other [[tauopathies]], such as [[Alzheimer's disease]]. The four clinical stages of observable CTE disability have been correlated with tau pathology in brain tissue, ranging in severity from focal perivascular epicenters of neurofibrillary tangles in the frontal neocortex to severe tauopathy affecting widespread brain regions.<ref name="McKee2013">{{cite journal |vauthors=[[Ann McKee|McKee AC]], Stern RA, [[Christopher Nowinski|Nowinski CJ]], Stein TD, Alvarez VE, Daneshvar DH, Lee HS, Wojtowicz SM, Hall G, Baugh CM, Riley DO, Kubilus CA, Cormier KA, Jacobs MA, Martin BR, Abraham CR, Ikezu T, Reichard RR, Wolozin BL, Budson AE, Goldstein LE, Kowall NW, Cantu RC |title=The spectrum of disease in chronic traumatic encephalopathy |journal= Brain |volume=136 |issue=Pt 1 |pages=43–64 |year=2013 |pmid=23208308 |pmc=3624697 |doi=10.1093/brain/aws307}}</ref>

The primary physical manifestations of CTE include a reduction in brain weight, associated with atrophy of the frontal and temporal cortices and [[medial temporal lobe]]. The lateral [[Ventricular system|ventricles]] and the [[third ventricle]] are often enlarged, with rare instances of dilation of the [[fourth ventricle]].<ref name="Baugh C et al 2012 244–254">{{cite journal |vauthors=Baugh CM, Stamm JM, Riley DO, Gavett BE, Shenton ME, Lin A, [[Christopher Nowinski|Nowinski CJ]], Cantu RC, [[Ann McKee|McKee AC]], Stern RA |title=Chronic traumatic encephalopathy: neurodegeneration following repetitive concussive and subconcussive brain trauma |journal=Brain Imaging Behavior |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages= 244–54 |year=2012 |pmid=22552850 |doi=10.1007/s11682-012-9164-5 |s2cid=15955018 }}</ref> Other physical manifestations of CTE include anterior [[cavum septi pellucidi]] and posterior [[fenestra]]tions, pallor of the [[substantia nigra]] and [[locus ceruleus]], and atrophy of the [[olfactory bulbs]], [[thalamus]], [[mammillary bodies]], [[brainstem]] and [[cerebellum]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Jancin |first=Bruce |title=Chronic traumatic encephalopathy test sought |url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CA291245393&v=2.1&it=r&p=HRCA&sw=w |access-date=15 December 2013 |newspaper=Internal Medicine News |date=1 June 2011}}</ref> As CTE progresses, there may be marked atrophy of the [[hippocampus]], [[entorhinal cortex]], and [[amygdala]].<ref name="pmid19535999" />

On a microscopic scale, a pathognomonic CTE lesion involves p-tau aggregates in neurons, with or without thorn-shaped astrocytes, at the depths of the cortical sulcus around a small blood vessel, deep in the parenchyma, and not restricted to the subpial and superficial region of the sulcus; the pathognomonic lesion must include p-tau in neurons to distinguish CTE from ARTAG ([[Aging-related tau astrogliopathy]].)<ref name="auto">{{cite journal |last1=Bienek |first1=Kevin F. |last2=al |first2=et |title=The Second NINDS/NIBIB Consensus Meeting to Define Neuropathological Criteria for the Diagnosis of Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy |journal=Neuropathology and Experimental Neurology |date=21 February 2021 |volume=80 |issue=3 |pages=210–219 |doi=10.1093/jnen/nlab001 |pmid=33611507 | pmc=7899277}}</ref> Supporting features of CTE are: superficial [[neurofibrillary tangle]]s (NFTs); p–tau in CA2 and CA4 hippocampus; p-tau in: mammillary bodies, hypothalamic nuclei, amygdala, nucleus accumbens, thalamus, midbrain tegmentum, nucleus basalis of Meynert, raphe nuclei, substantia nigra and locus coeruleus; p-tau thorn-shaped astrocytes (TSA) in the subpial region; p-tau dot-like [[neurites]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=McKee |first1=Ann C.|author1-link=Ann McKee |last2=al |first2=et |title=The first NINDS/NIBIB consensus meeting to define neuropathological criteria for the diagnosis of chronic traumatic encephalopathy |journal=Acta Neuropathologica |date=January 2016 |volume=131 |issue=1 |pages=75–86 |doi=10.1007/s00401-015-1515-z|pmid=26667418 |pmc=4698281 }}</ref> Purely astrocytic perivascular p-tau pathology represents ARTAG and does not meet the criteria for CTE.<ref name="auto"/>

A small group of individuals with CTE have chronic traumatic encephalomyopathy (CTEM), which is characterized by symptoms of motor-neuron disease and which mimics [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]] (ALS). Progressive muscle weakness and balance and gait problems (problems with walking) seem to be early signs of CTEM.<ref name="Baugh C et al 2012 244–254"/>

Loss of [[neuron]]s, scarring of brain tissue, collection of [[protein]]aceous senile plaques, [[hydrocephalus]], attenuation of the [[corpus callosum]], [[diffuse axonal injury]], [[neurofibrillary tangle]]s, and damage to the [[cerebellum]] are implicated in the syndrome.

Increased exposure to concussions and subconcussive blows is regarded as the most important risk factor. In boxing, this exposure can depend on the total number of fights, number of knockout losses, the duration of career, fight frequency, age of retirement, and boxing style.<ref>Jordan, B.&nbsp;D. (2009). "Brain injury in boxing". ''Clinics in Sports Medicine'', 28(4), 561–78, vi.</ref>

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis of CTE cannot be made in living individuals; a clear diagnosis is only possible during an autopsy.<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal|last=Concannon|first=Leah|date=2014|title=Counseling Athletes on the Risk on Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy|journal=Sports Health|volume=6|issue=5|pages=396–401|doi=10.1177/1941738114530958|pmid=25177414|pmc=4137675}}</ref> Though there are signs and symptoms some researchers associate with CTE, there is no definitive test to prove the existence in a living person. Signs are also very similar to those of other neurological conditions, such as Alzheimer's.<ref>Turner, Ryan C., et al. [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27715315/ "Alzheimer's disease and chronic traumatic encephalopathy: Distinct but possibly overlapping disease entities"], ''[[Brain Injury (journal)|Brain Injury]]'', August 11, 2016. Accessed December 28, 2021. "Alzheimer's disease (AD) and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) have long been recognized as sharing some similar neuropathological features, mainly the presence of neurofibrilary tangles and hyperphosphorylated tau, but have generally been described as distinct entities. Evidence indicates that neurotrauma increases the risk of developing dementia and accelerates the progression of disease. Findings are emerging that CTE and AD may be present in the same patients."</ref>

The lack of distinct [[biomarker]]s is the reason CTE cannot typically be diagnosed while a person is alive. Concussions are non-structural injuries and do not result in brain bleeding, which is why most concussions cannot be seen on routine neuroimaging tests such as CT or MRI.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Poirier MP |title=Concussions: Assessment, management, and recommendations for return to activity |journal=Clinical Pediatric Emergency Medicine |volume=4|issue=3|pages=179–85|year=2003 |doi=10.1016/S1522-8401(03)00061-2}}</ref> Acute concussion symptoms (those that occur shortly after an injury) should not be confused with CTE. Differentiating between prolonged post-concussion syndrome (PCS, where symptoms begin shortly after a concussion and last for weeks, months, and sometimes even years) and CTE symptoms can be difficult. Research studies are examining whether neuroimaging can detect subtle changes in [[axon]]al integrity and structural lesions that can occur in CTE.<ref name="pmid19535999"/> By the early 2010s, more progress in [[in-vivo]] diagnostic techniques for CTE had been made, using [[Diffusion tensor imaging|DTI]], [[fMRI]], [[MRI]], and [[In vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopy|MRS]] imaging; however, more research needs to be done before any such techniques can be validated.<ref name="Baugh C et al 2012 244–254"/>

[[Positron emission tomography|PET]] tracers that bind specifically to [[tau protein]] are desired to aid diagnosis of CTE in living individuals. One candidate is the tracer {{Not a typo|[<u></u>[[Fluorine-18|<sup>18</sup>F]]]FDDNP}}, which is retained in the brain in individuals with a number of dementing disorders such as [[Alzheimer's disease]], [[Down syndrome]], [[progressive supranuclear palsy]], [[corticobasal degeneration]], [[frontotemporal dementia|familial frontotemporal dementia]], and [[Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease]].<ref name=Villemagne2015>{{cite journal |vauthors=Villemagne VL, Fodero-Tavoletti MT, Masters CL, Rowe CC |title=Tau imaging: early progress and future directions |journal=The Lancet.

A putative biomarker for CTE is the presence in serum of autoantibodies against the brain. The autoantibodies were detected in football players who experienced a large number of head hits but no concussions, suggesting that even sub-concussive episodes may be damaging to the brain. The autoantibodies may enter the brain by means of a disrupted [[Blood brain barrier|blood-brain barrier]], and attack neuronal cells which are normally protected from an immune onslaught.<ref>John Mangels, [http://www.cleveland.com/science/index.ssf/2013/03/non-concussion_football_head_h.html Cleveland ''Plain Dealer''], 2013/03.</ref> Given the large numbers of neurons present in the brain (86&nbsp;billion), and considering the poor penetration of antibodies across a normal blood-brain barrier, there is an extended period of time between the initial events (head hits) and the development of any signs or symptoms. Nevertheless, autoimmune changes in blood of players may constitute the earliest measurable event predicting CTE.<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite journal |vauthors=Marchi N, Bazarian JJ, Puvenna V, Janigro M, Ghosh C, Zhong J, Zhu T, Blackman E, Stewart D, Ellis J, Butler R, Janigro D |title=Consequences of repeated blood-brain barrier disruption in football players |journal=PLOS ONE |volume=8 |issue=3 |page=e56805 |year=2013 |pmid=23483891 |pmc=3590196 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0056805 |bibcode=2013PLoSO...856805M |doi-access=free }}</ref>

==History==
CTE was originally studied in boxers in the 1920s as "punch-drunk syndrome." Punch-drunk syndrome was first described in 1928 by a forensic pathologist, Dr. [[Harrison Stanford Martland]], who was the chief medical examiner of [[Essex County, New Jersey|Essex County]] in [[Newark, New Jersey]], in a ''[[Journal of the American Medical Association]]'' article, in which he noted the tremors, slowed movement, confusion and speech problems typical of the condition.<ref>{{cite journal |author= Martland HS|title=Punch Drunk |journal=Journal of the American Medical Association |volume=91 |issue=15 |pages=1103–07|year=1928 |doi=10.1001/jama.1928.02700150029009  }}</ref> The term "punch-drunk" was replaced with "dementia pugilistica" in 1937 by J.A. Millsbaugh, as he felt the term was condescending to former boxers.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Castellani |first1=Rudy J. |last2=Perry |first2=George |title=Dementia Pugilistica Revisited |journal=Journal of Alzheimer's Disease |date=7 November 2017 |volume=60 |issue=4 |pages=1209–21|doi=10.3233/JAD-170669 |pmid=29036831 |pmc=5676846 }}</ref> The initial diagnosis of ''dementia pugilistica'' was derived from the [[Latin]] word for boxer ''pugil'' (akin to ''pugnus''  'fist', ''pugnāre''  'to fight').<ref>[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/pugilism Pugilism (origin)], retrieved on 2 February 2013.</ref><ref>NCERx. 2005.

Other terms for the condition have included chronic boxer's encephalopathy, traumatic boxer's encephalopathy, boxer's dementia, pugilistic dementia, chronic traumatic brain injury associated with boxing (CTBI-B), and punch-drunk syndrome.<ref name="Alz2017" />

British neurologist, [[Macdonald Critchley]], wrote a 1949 paper titled "Punch-drunk syndromes: the chronic traumatic encephalopathy of boxers".<ref>[http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2015/12/17/concussion-bennet-omalu-nfl/ "'Concussion' Subject Bennet Omalu Exaggerated His Role, Researchers Say"]. [[CBS New York]]. 17 December 2015.</ref> CTE was first recognized as affecting individuals who took considerable blows to the head, but was believed to be confined to boxers and not other athletes. As evidence pertaining to the clinical and neuropathological consequences of repeated mild head trauma grew, it became clear that this pattern of neurodegeneration was not restricted to boxers, and the term chronic traumatic encephalopathy became most widely used.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Martland H | title=Punch Drunk|journal=The Journal of the American Medical Association |volume=91|issue=15 |pages=1103–07 |year=1928 |doi=10.1001/jama.1928.02700150029009}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | pmc = 2995699 |pmid=21074091 |doi=10.1016/j.csm.2010.09.007 |volume=30 |issue=1 |title=Chronic traumatic encephalopathy: a potential late effect of sport-related concussive and subconcussive head trauma |year=2011 |journal=Clin Sports Med |pages=179–88, xi |vauthors=Gavett BE, Stern RA, [[Ann McKee|McKee AC]]}}</ref>

In 2017, [[Aaron Hernandez]], a former professional football player and convicted murderer, committed suicide at the age of 27 while in prison. His family donated his brain to the [[Boston University CTE Center and Brain Bank|BU CTE Center]]. [[Ann McKee]], the head of Center, concluded that "Hernandez had Stage 3 CTE, which researchers had never seen in a brain younger than 46 years old."<ref>{{cite news |last=Kilgore |first=Adam |title=Aaron Hernandez suffered from most severe CTE ever found in a person his age |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/aaron-hernandez-suffered-from-most-severe-cte-ever-found-in-a-person-his-age/2017/11/09/fa7cd204-c57b-11e7-afe9-4f60b5a6c4a0_story.html|access-date=12 July 2020 |newspaper=Washington Post |date=9 November 2017}}</ref>

In 2022, former [[NRL]] player and coach Paul Green died by suicide at the age of 49.

In 2023, [[Australian rules football]] player [[Heather Anderson]] became the first female athlete diagnosed with CTE after her death by suicide on 13 November 2022, at the age of 28. Her brain, which was donated to the [[Australian Sports Brain Bank]], was found to contain multiple CTE lesions, and abnormalities were found "nearby everywhere" in the cortex.<ref>{{cite web |title=Heather Anderson diagnosed with CTE in 1st case for female athlete |url=https://www.espn.com/afl/story/_/id/37956773/aflw-player-heather-anderson-first-woman-diagnosed-cte |website=ESPN |date=4 July 2023 }}</ref>
