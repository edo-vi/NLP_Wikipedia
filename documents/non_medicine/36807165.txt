'''Boosting''' is a method of inducing [[autonomic dysreflexia]] with the intention of enhancing performance in sport. It can be used by an athlete with a [[spinal cord injury]] to increase their [[blood pressure]] and is performed by causing a painful stimulus in the lower part of the body. The [[International Paralympic Committee]] (IPC) banned the practice in 1994, but many competitors with spinal injuries are still thought to be using it as a performance enhancer.

==Method==
Athletes with spinal injuries can have difficulties with autonomic functions and their bodies may be unable to control blood pressure and [[heart rate]]. Because of this their bodies do not adapt to the increased demand of physical activity. Without these changes the athlete can become fatigued and suffer from a lower level of endurance. Boosting works by tricking the body into a state of high blood pressure and heart rate,<ref name="ADaB">{{cite web|url=http://www.paralympic.org/sites/default/files/document/120131183408508_Thompson_Autonomic_Dysreflexia_and_Boosting.pdf|title=Autonomic Dysreflexia and Boosting: Lessons from an athlete survey|publisher=International Paralympic Committee|accessdate=23 August 2012}}</ref> with an increased utilization of oxygen improving the athlete's performance.<ref name="Bhambhani">{{cite web|url=http://www.wada-ama.org/rtecontent/document/Bhambhani_final_report_2009.PDF |title=Boosting in Athletes with High Level Spinal Cord Injury: Incidence, Knowledge and Attitudes of Athletes in Paralympic Sport |publisher=World Anti-Doping Agency |date=30 April 2009 |accessdate=23 August 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120831175741/http://www.wada-ama.org/rtecontent/document/Bhambhani_final_report_2009.PDF |archivedate=31 August 2012 }}</ref>

Athletes who perform boosting before or during an event will often [[self-harm]] with some taking extreme measures to achieve the desired boost level. Techniques include:<ref name="McGrath">{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-19325756|title=Paralympic athletes who harm themselves to perform better|first=Matt|last=McGrath|publisher=BBC News|date=23 August 2012|accessdate=23 August 2012}}</ref><ref name="Thomson">{{cite web|url=http://www.publicaffairs.ubc.ca/2010/03/04/the-danger-of-paralympic-boosting/|title=The Danger of Paralympic Boosting|first=Hilary|last=Thomson|publisher=University of British Columbia|accessdate=23 August 2012}}</ref>
*Clamping the [[catheter]] to ensure that the bladder becomes overly full
*Overly tightening leg straps
*Electric shocks or stress to the feet, legs, scrotum, or testicles
*Breaking a bone, usually in the toe.

==Effectiveness and risks==

Boosting has been shown in simulated races to give noticeable improvements in the performance of wheelchair marathon athletes.<ref name="Bhambhani" /><ref name="Harris">{{cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/sc/journal/v32/n5/pdf/sc199450a.pdf|title=Self-induced autonomic dysreflexia ('boosting') practised by some tetraplegic athletes to enhance their athletic performance|publisher=International Medical Society of Paraplegia|year=1994|first=Phillip|last=Harris|accessdate=23 August 2012|volume=32|issue=5|doi=10.1038/sc.1994.50|pmid=8058344|journal=Paraplegia|pages=289–291|doi-access=free}}</ref> In the 1994 study the athletes attained an average 9.7 percent improvement after their bladder had been over-distended or after sitting in the racing chair for 1–2 hours prior to competing.<ref name="Harris" /> It is believed to be capable of enhancing performance by up to 15 percent.<ref name="Thomson" />

There are many possible side effects of boosting, including the occurrence of a cerebrovascular or cardiovascular event such as a stroke or heart attack.<ref name="Bhambhani" /><ref name="McGrath" /> Other complications include:<ref name="Harris" />
*[[aphasia]]
*[[bradycardia]]
*[[cerebral hemorrhage|cerebral haemorrhage]]
*[[epilepsy]]
*[[hypertension]]
*[[hyperthermia]]
*neurological abnormalities
*visual disturbances

==Prevalence==
The IPC conducted a survey during the 2008 Games with 99 responses.<ref name="ADaB" /><ref name="McGrath" /> 16.7 percent of the participants indicated that they had tried boosting in training or during a competition, with more than half of them being competitors in [[wheelchair rugby]].<ref name="ADaB" /> The use of boosting continues in athletes but is very difficult to detect.<ref name="McGrath" /><ref name="Thomson" /> During the Games 20 athletes were tested just before their event for evidence of boosting but there were no positive results.<ref name="ADaB" />

==IPC view==
The IPC made boosting illegal in 1994.<ref name="McGrath" /> Their handbook states in Chapter 4.3:
<blockquote>An athlete with a systolic blood pressure of 180mm Hg or above will be re-examined approximately ten minutes after the first examination. If on the second examination the systolic blood pressure remains above 180mm Hg the person in charge of the examination shall inform the Technical Delegate to withdraw the athlete from the particular competition in question.
<br /><br />
Any deliberate attempt to induce Autonomic Dysreflexia is forbidden and will be reported to the Technical Delegate. The athlete will be disqualified from the particular competition regardless of the systolic blood pressure.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.paralympic.org/sites/default/files/document/120203171154502_Sec_ii_chapter_4.3_Position_Statement_on_Autonomic_Dysreflexia_and_Boosting.pdf|title=IPC Handbook|publisher=International Paralympic Committee|date=April 2009|accessdate=23 August 2012}}</ref></blockquote>
