[[File:Femke van den driessche-1454767232.jpg|thumb|right|[[Femke Van den Driessche]], the first cyclist to be sanctioned for mechanical doping.]]
'''Motor doping''', or '''mechanical doping''', in [[competitive cycling]] terminology, is a method of cheating by using a hidden [[motor]] to help propel a [[racing bicycle]]. The term is an analogy to chemical [[doping in sport]], cheating by using [[performance-enhancing drugs]]. As a form of "[[technology doping|technological fraud]]" it is banned by the {{lang|fr|[[Union Cycliste Internationale]]}}, the international governing body of cycling.

==History==
One of the first allegations of mechanical doping goes back to the [[2010 Tour of Flanders]] when [[Fabian Cancellara]] attacked [[Tom Boonen]] on a steep part of [[Muur van Geraardsbergen|Kapelmuur]] whilst unusually seated, leading to allegations that there was an electric motor hidden in Cancellara's bike.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cyclingnews.com/features/mechanical-doping-a-brief-history/|title=Mechanical doping: A brief history|website=Cyclingnews.com|access-date=29 April 2016}}</ref> Four years later the issue was raised again when [[Ryder Hesjedal]] was the subject of allegations of mechanical doping during the [[2014 Vuelta a España]]: Hesjedal crashed on stage seven of the race, and video footage of the crash showed his bicycle's rear wheel continuing to spin after it had fallen onto the road, leading to a number of media outlets including the website of French sports newspaper ''[[L'Equipe]]'' questioning whether the bike contained a motor, although it was suggested by ''[[Cycling Weekly]]'' that the bicycle's movement could have simply been due to it sliding on a downward gradient.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cyclingweekly.co.uk/news/latest-news/fresh-motorised-doping-claims-ryder-hesjedals-bike-moves-134745 |title=Fresh 'motorised doping' claims as Ryder Hesjedal's bike 'moves on its own' |last1=Wynn |first1=Nigel |date=4 September 2014 |website=[[Cycling Weekly]]|access-date=14 May 2016}}</ref> Public pressure on the UCI led to the race [[Commissaire (cycling)|commissaires]] examining the bikes of Hesjedal's {{ct|GRS|2014}} team the following morning: no motors were found.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cyclingweekly.co.uk/news/latest-news/ryder-hesjedals-clockwork-cervelo-uci-checks-garmin-sharp-bikes-134803 |title=Ryder Hesjedal's clockwork Cervelo: UCI checks Garmin-Sharp bikes |last1=Pryde |first1=Kenny|date=4 September 2014 |website=[[Cycling Weekly]] |access-date=14 May 2016}}</ref> The following spring, checks for bike motors were carried out at [[2015 Paris–Nice|Paris–Nice]], [[2015 Milan–San Remo|Milan–San Remo]], and the [[2015 Giro d'Italia|Giro d'Italia]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cyclingnews.com/news/uci-checks-bikes-of-contador-hesjedal-and-gilbert-for-motors-at-giro-ditalia/ |title=UCI checks bikes of Contador, Hesjedal and Gilbert for motors at Giro d'Italia |last1=Farrand |first1=Stephen |date=29 May 2015 |website=[[cyclingnews.com]] |access-date=14 May 2016}}</ref>

In January 2016 – almost six years after initial allegations of a pro cyclist doping mechanically – the first confirmed use of "mechanical doping" in the sport was discovered at the [[2016 UCI Cyclo-cross World Championships]] when one of the bikes of Belgian cyclist [[Femke Van den Driessche]] was found to have a secret motor inside.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/more-sports/pro-cyclist-caught-hidden-motor-bike-race-article-1.2516543 |title=Cyclist Femke Van den Driessche caught with hidden motor inside bike during race |first1=Nathaniel |last1=Vinton |newspaper=[[New York Daily News]] |date=1 February 2016 |access-date=29 February 2016}}</ref><ref name="Clarke">{{cite news |url=http://www.cyclingweekly.co.uk/news/latest-news/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-motorised-doping-scandal-209635 |newspaper=[[Cycling Weekly]] |title=Everything you need to know about the motorised doping scandal |first1=Stuart |last1=Clarke |date=1 February 2016 |access-date=29 February 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://mobile.businessinsider.com/hidden-motor-found-attached-to-her-cyclists-bike-2016-2 |title=A cyclist has been barred from the world championships after a hidden motor was found attached to her bike |work=[[Business Insider Australia]] |first1=Peter |last1=Farquhar |date=1 February 2016 |access-date=29 February 2016}}</ref><ref name="Mah">{{cite news |url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/cycling-what-is/2496110.html |title=Cycling: What is mechanical doping? |format=Video |publisher=Channel News Asia |location=Singapore |first1=Ewan |last1=Mah |date=7 February 2016 |access-date=1 March 2016}}</ref>

Some sources claim that motorized doping has occurred before in professional cycling, but that it has gone undetected or unproven. It is seen as part of a larger effort by athletes in many sports to gain mechanical advantage in competition.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://thevarsity.ca/2016/02/29/the-technical-side-of-doping/ |title=The technical side of doping: How technology helps athletes gain an unfair advantage |first1=Isaac |last1=Consenstein |newspaper=[[The Varsity (newspaper)|The Varsity]] |publisher=[[University of Toronto]] |date=29 February 2016 |access-date=29 February 2016}}</ref> In May 2010 former rider [[Davide Cassani]] demonstrated a motorised bicycle on the Italian public broadcaster [[RAI]], claiming that similar bikes had been used by some professional cyclists since 2004.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cyclingweekly.co.uk/news/latest-news/cassani-helps-in-sporting-fraud-investigation-of-motorised-bike-59948 |title=Cassani helps in sporting fraud investigation of motorised bike |last1=Brown |first1=Gregor |date=15 June 2010 |website=[[Cycling Weekly]]|access-date=14 May 2016}}</ref> The discovery of a motor resulted in a substantial uptick in the level of scrutiny focused on bikes.

One blogger described it as the worst scandal in cycling since the doping scandal that engulfed [[Lance Armstrong]] in 2012.<ref name="McMahon3">{{cite news |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/cycling-mechanical-doping-scandal-2016-2 |title='Mechanical doping,' the biggest scandal to rock pro cycling since Lance Armstrong, is very real — here's what we know so far |first1=Daniel |last1=McMahon |date=12 February 2016 |work=Business Insider |access-date=1 March 2016}}</ref>

==UCI regulations==
The federation's technological fraud article 12.1.013 fully states:<br/>
<blockquote>"Technological fraud is an infringement to article 1.3.010. Technological fraud is materialised by:

"The presence, within or on the margins of a cycling competition, of a bicycle that does not comply with the provisions of article 1.3.010. The use by a rider, within or on the margins of a cycling competition, of a bicycle that does not comply with the provisions of article 1.3.010. All teams must ensure that all their bicycles are in compliance with the provisions of article 1.3.010. Any presence of a bicycle that does not comply with the provisions of article 1.3.010, within or on the margins of a cycling competition, constitutes a technological fraud by the team and the rider. All riders must ensure that any bicycle that they use is in compliance with the provisions of article 1.3.010. Any use by a rider of a bicycle that does not comply with the provisions of article 1.3.010, within or on the margins of a cycling competition, constitutes a technological fraud by the team and the rider.<br/>

Any technological fraud shall be sanctioned as follows:
# Rider: disqualification, suspension of a minimum of six months and a fine of between CHF 20,000 and CHF 200,000.
# Team: disqualification, suspension of a minimum of six months and a fine of between CHF 100,000 and CHF 1,000,000."</blockquote>

In pertinent part, the technical regulation plainly states:
<blockquote>"The bicycle shall be propelled solely, through a chainset, by the legs (inferior muscular chain) moving in a circular movement, without electric or other assistance."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uci.ch/mm/Document/News/Rulesandregulation/16/51/61/Clarificationguideofrules2012-ENG_English.PDF |page=7 |publisher=[[Union Cycliste Internationale]] |title=Clarification Guide of the UCI Technical Regulation 23.04.2014 version |access-date=29 February 2016}}</ref></blockquote>
