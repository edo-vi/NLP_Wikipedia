'''Dataism''' is a term that has been used to describe the mindset or [[philosophy]] created by the emerging significance of [[big data]]. It was first used by [[David Brooks (cultural commentator)|David Brooks]] in ''[[The New York Times]]'' in 2013.<ref name="Brooks 2018" /> The term has been expanded to describe what [[historian]] [[Yuval Noah Harari]], in his book [[Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow]] from 2015, calls an emerging [[ideology]] or even a new form of religion, in which "information flow" is the "supreme value".<ref name="Harari 2017" />

== History ==
"If you asked me to describe the rising philosophy of the day, I'd say it is Data-ism", wrote [[David Brooks (cultural commentator)|David Brooks]] in ''The New York Times'' in February 2013.<ref name="Brooks 2018">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/05/opinion/brooks-the-philosophy-of-data.html|title=Opinion {{!}} The Philosophy of Data|last=Brooks|first=David|date=2013-02-04|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-01-05|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> Brooks argued that in a world of increasing complexity, relying on data could reduce cognitive biases and "illuminate patterns of behavior we haven't yet noticed".<ref name="Brooks 2018"/>

In 2015, Steve Lohr's book ''Data-ism'' looked at how Big Data is transforming society, using the term to describe the Big Data revolution.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/you-can-run-from-big-data-but-can-you-hide/2015/03/20/082ea46c-c805-11e4-a199-6cb5e63819d2_story.html|title=You can run from Big Data, but can you hide?|last=Igo|first=Sarah E.|date=2015-03-20|newspaper=Washington Post|access-date=2018-01-05|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Data-ism : The Revolution Transforming Decision Making, Consumer Behavior, and Almost Everything Else|last=Lohr|first=Steve|publisher=HarperBusiness|date=May 2015|isbn=978-0062226815|edition=First|location=New York, NY|oclc=861210012}}</ref>

In his 2016 book ''[[Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow]]'', [[Yuval Noah Harari]] argues that all competing political or social structures can be seen as data processing systems: "Dataism declares that the universe consists of data flows, and the value of any phenomenon or entity is determined by its contribution to data processing" and "we may interpret the entire human species as a single data processing system, with individual humans serving as its chips."<ref name="Harari 2017">{{Cite book|title=Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow|last=Harari|first=Yuval Noah|publisher=Vintage Penguin Random House|year=2017|isbn=9781784703936|location=UK|pages=428}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/article/yuval-noah-harari-dataism|title='Homo sapiens is an obsolete algorithm': Yuval Noah Harari on how data could eat the world|last=Harari|first=Yuval|access-date=2018-01-05}}</ref> According to Harari, a Dataist should want to "maximise dataflow by connecting to more and more media". Harari predicts that the logical conclusion of this process is that, eventually, humans will give algorithms the authority to make the most important decisions in their lives, such as whom to marry and which career to pursue.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow|last=Harari|first=Yuval Noah|publisher=Vintage Penguin Random House|year=2017|isbn=9781784703936|location=UK|pages=445}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/50bb4830-6a4c-11e6-ae5b-a7cc5dd5a28c|title=Yuval Noah Harari on big data, Google and the end of free will|last=Harari|first=Yuval Noah|date=2016-08-26|website=Financial Times|access-date=2018-01-05}}</ref> Harari argues that [[Aaron Swartz]] could be called the "first martyr" of Dataism.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Yuval Noah Harari |title=Data Processing - Part 1 |website=[[YouTube]] |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VJMYWKH-W8&t=1590 |access-date=27 September 2018 |format=Video |date=18 April 2013|author1-link=Yuval Noah Harari }}</ref>

== Criticism ==
Commenting on Harari's characterisation of Dataism, security analyst Daniel Miessler believes that Dataism does not present the challenge to the ideology of liberal humanism that Harari claims, because humans will simultaneously be able to believe in their own importance and that of data.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://danielmiessler.com/blog/some-thoughts-on-dataism/|title=Some Thoughts on Dataism|date=2017-04-07|work=Daniel Miessler|access-date=2018-01-05|language=en-US}}</ref>

Harari himself raises some criticisms, such as the problem of consciousness, which Dataism is unlikely to illuminate. Humans may also find out that organisms are not algorithms, he suggests.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://dataethics.eu/en/humanism-dataism-future-scenario/|title=From Humanism to Dataism. A future scenario. - Dataethical Thinkdotank|date=2017-04-25|work=Dataethical Thinkdotank|access-date=2018-01-05|language=en-GB}}</ref> Dataism implies that all data is public, even personal data, to make the system work as a whole, which is a factor that's already showing resistance today.<ref name="singularityhub 2018">{{cite web|url=https://singularityhub.com/2018/09/30/the-rise-of-dataism-a-threat-to-freedom-or-a-scientific-revolution/|title=The Rise of Dataism: A Threat to Freedom or a Scientific Revolution?|website=Singularityhub.com|date=30 September 2018|author=Steven Parton|access-date=18 November 2019}}</ref>

Other analysts, such as Terry Ortleib, have looked at the extent to which Dataism poses a dystopian threat to humanity.<ref>{{Citation|last=Terry Ortlieb|title=is Harari Dataism Dystopian|date=2017-03-07|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ev0Q4tCwgdI|access-date=2018-01-05}}</ref>

The [[Facebook–Cambridge Analytica data scandal]] showed how political leaders manipulated Facebook's users' data to build specific psychological profiles that went on to manipulate the network. A team of data analysts reproduced the AI technology developed by Cambridge Analytica around Facebook's data and was able to define the following rules: 10 likes enables a machine to know a person like a coworker, 70 likes like a friend would, 150 likes like a parent would, 300 likes like a lover would, and beyond it may be possible to know a people better than they know themselves.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/mg9vvn/how-our-likes-helped-trump-win|title=The Data That Turned the World Upside Down|website=Vice.com|date=28 January 2017|author1=Hannes Grassegger|author2=Mikael Krogerus|access-date=18 November 2019}}</ref>
