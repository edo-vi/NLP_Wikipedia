A '''dual narrative''' is a form of [[narrative]] that tells a story in two different perspectives, usually two different people. '''Dual narrative''' is also an effective technique that can be used to tell the story of people (or one person) at two different points in time (''[[Postcards from No Man's Land]]'', ''[[Great Expectations]]'').
It is used to show parallels or emphasise differences in the lifestyles or points-of-view of different places or time periods.<ref>{{cite web|last=Haertsch|first=Gretchen|title=The Dual Narrative- Does it Work?|url=http://birthofanovel.wordpress.com/2011/09/21/the-dual-narrative-does-it-work/|accessdate=6 February 2012}}</ref>
