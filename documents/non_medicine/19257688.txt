{{Short history of China}}

A '''conquest dynasty''' ({{zh |c = 征服王朝 |p = Zhēngfú Wángcháo}}) in the [[history of China]] refers to a [[Dynasties in Chinese history|Chinese dynasty]] established by non-[[Han Chinese|Han]] ethnicities that ruled parts or all of [[China proper]], the traditional heartland of the Han people, and whose rulers may or may not fully [[Sinicization|assimilate]] into the dominant Han culture.

== Concept ==
The term "conquest dynasty" was coined by the German-American [[Sinology|sinologist]] [[Karl August Wittfogel]] in his 1949 [[Historical revisionism|revisionist]] history of the [[Liao dynasty]] (916–1125). He argued that the Liao, as well as the [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)|Jin]] (1115–1234), [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]] (1271–1368), and [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] (1636–1912) dynasties of China were not really "Chinese", and that the ruling families did not fully assimilate into the dominant Han culture. The "conquest dynasty" concept was warmly received by mostly Japanese scholars such as Otagi Matsuo, who preferred to view these dynasties in the context of a "history of Asia" rather than a "history of China". Alternative views to the concept of "conquest dynasty" from American sinologists include [[Owen Lattimore]]'s idea of the [[Eurasian Steppe|steppe]] as a "reservoir", [[Wolfram Eberhard]]'s concept of a "superstratification" of Chinese society with nomadic peoples, and [[Mary C. Wright]]'s thesis of [[sinicization]]. Among historians, the labelling of "conquest dynasties" has proven to be controversial, especially when using such characterization on dynasties such as the Jin.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Jurchen in Twelfth-Century China: A Study of Sinicization|first=Jing-shen|last=Tao|publisher=University of Washington Press|pages=xi–x}}</ref>

In the English language, "''Zhongguo ren''" ({{lang|zh-Hant|中國人}}; "People of China") is frequently confused and conflated with "''Han ren''" ({{lang|zh-Hant|漢人}}; "[[Han Chinese|Han people]]").<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=zxPpHkumqbEC&pg=PA266 Liu 2004], p. 266.</ref>

In 1271, [[Kublai Khan]] proclaimed the Yuan dynasty with the official name "Great Yuan" ({{lang|zh-Hant|大元}}) and claimed succession from former Chinese dynasties from the [[Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors]] up to the [[Tang dynasty]].

[[List of emperors of the Qing dynasty|Qing emperors]] referred to all subjects of the Qing dynasty regardless of their [[Ethnic groups in Chinese history|ethnicity]] as "Chinese" ({{lang|zh-Hant|中國之人}}), and used the term "''Zhongguo''" as a synonym for the entire Qing Empire while using "''neidi''" ({{lang|zh-Hant|内地}}; "inner regions") to refer only to the core area (or [[China proper]]) of the empire. The Qing Empire was viewed as a single multi-ethnic entity.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pdfhost.io/v/hJZFAR.ub_|title=Overseas Chinese, Ethnic Minorities and Nationalism: De-Centering China (2010) (pages 20-22)|author=Elena Barabantseva|publisher=New York: Routledge|date=2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20220816090209/https://pdfhost.io/pdf/0fc4fdb2-c00d-45f7-afb4-19b17e131b15/3ba0e121-fb2e-4536-bc68-dbadb0b4d169.pdf|archivedate=2022-08-16|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eai.or.kr/data/bbs/eng_report/201305161115181.pdf|title=Managing Hegemony in East Asia: China's Rise in Historical Perspective|author=Yuan-kang WANG|publisher=Western Michigan University|date=May 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20220410182539/eai.or.kr/data/bbs/eng_report/201305161115181.pdf|archivedate=2022-04-10|url-status=live}}</ref>

The Qing emperors governed frontier non-Han areas in a separate administrative system under the [[Lifan Yuan]]. Nonetheless, it was the Qing emperors who expanded the definition of ''Zhongguo'' and made it "flexible" by using that term to refer to the entire empire. ''Zhongguo'' was also used by the Qing Empire as an endonym in diplomatic correspondence. However, some Han subjects criticized their usage of the term and used ''Zhongguo'' only to refer to the seventeen provinces of China and three provinces of the east (Manchuria), excluding other frontier areas.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=pt6wlBmUEU0C&pg=PA232 Esherick 2006], p. 232.</ref> Han literati who remained loyal to the Ming dynasty held to defining the old Ming borders as "China" and used the term "foreigner" to describe ethnic minorities under Qing rule, such as the Mongols, as part of their [[Anti-Qing sentiment|anti-Qing]] ideology.<ref>[https://www.academia.edu/6928995/The_Literati_Rewriting_of_China_in_the_Qianlong-Jiaqing_Transition Mosca 2011], p. 94.</ref> As the territorial borders of the Qing Empire were fixed through a series of treaties with neighboring foreign powers, it was able to inculcate in the Qing subjects a sense that China included areas such as [[Mongolia under Qing rule|Mongolia]] and [[Tibet under Qing rule|Tibet]] due to educational reforms. Specifically, the educational reform made it clear where the borders of the Qing Empire were, even if Han subjects did not understand how the Chinese identity included Mongols and [[Tibetan people|Tibetans]] or understand what the connotations of being "Chinese" were.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=pt6wlBmUEU0C&pg=PA251 Esherick 2006], p. 251.</ref>

In an attempt to portray different ethnicities as part of one family ruled by the Qing dynasty, the phrase "''Zhongwai yijia''" ({{lang|zh-Hant|中外一家}}; "interior and exterior as one family") was used to convey the idea of the "unification" of different ethnic groups.{{sfnp|Elliott|Chia|2004|pp=76–77}} After conquering China proper, the Manchus identified their state as "China" ({{lang|zh-Hant|中國}}; {{transliteration|zh|Zhōngguó}}; "Middle Kingdom"), and referred to it as "''Dulimbai Gurun''" in the [[Manchu language]] (''Dulimbai'' means "central" or "middle", while ''gurun'' means "nation" or "state"). The emperors labelled the lands of the Qing Empire (including present-day [[Manchuria under Qing rule|Northeast China]], [[Xinjiang under Qing rule|Xinjiang]], Mongolia, Tibet, and other areas) as "China" in both the Chinese and Manchu languages. This effectively defined China as a multi-ethnic state, thereby rejecting the idea that "China" only meant Han-populated areas. The Qing emperors proclaimed that both Han and non-Han ethnic groups were part of "China". They also used both "China" and "Qing" to refer to their state in official documents, international treaties (the Qing Empire was known internationally as "China"<ref>[[s:Treaty of Nanking|Treaty of Nanking]]. 1842.</ref> or the "Chinese Empire"<ref>[[William McKinley|McKinley, William]]. "[[s:William McKinley's Second State of the Union Address|Second State of the Union Address]]". 5 Dec. 1898.</ref>), and foreign affairs. The "Chinese language" (''Dulimbai gurun i bithe'') included [[Chinese language|Chinese]], Manchu, [[Mongolian language|Mongol]], and [[Classical Tibetan|Tibetan]] languages, while the "Chinese people" ({{lang|zh-Hant|中國之人}}; {{transliteration|zh|Zhōngguó zhī rén}}; Manchu: ''Dulimbai gurun i niyalma'') referred to all subjects of the Qing Empire.{{sfnp|Zhao|2006|pp=n [https://web.archive.org/web/20140325231543/https://webspace.utexas.edu/hl4958/perspectives/Zhao%20-%20reinventing%20china.pdf 4, 7–10, and 12–14]}}

In the 1689 [[Treaty of Nerchinsk]], the term "China" (''Dulimbai Gurun''; ''Zhongguo'') was used to refer to the Qing territories in Manchuria in both the Manchu and Chinese language versions of the treaty. Additionally, the term "the wise [[Emperor of China]]" was also used in the Manchu version of the treaty.{{sfnp|Zhao|2006|pp=[https://web.archive.org/web/20140325231543/https://webspace.utexas.edu/hl4958/perspectives/Zhao%20-%20reinventing%20china.pdf 8 and 12]}}

The [[Qianlong Emperor]] rejected the earlier idea that only the Han people could be subjects of China and only Han lands could be considered as part of China. Instead, he redefined China as being multi-ethnic, saying in 1755 that "there exists a view of China (''Zhongxia''; {{lang|zh-Hant|中夏}}), according to which non-Han peoples cannot become China's subjects and their lands cannot be integrated into the territory of China. This does not represent our dynasty's understanding of China, but is instead a view of the earlier [[Han dynasty|Han]], Tang, [[Song dynasty|Song]], and Ming dynasties."<ref name="Zhao 2006" /> The Qianlong Emperor rejected the views of ethnic Han officials who claimed that Xinjiang was not part of China and that he should not annex it, putting forth the argument that China was multi-ethnic and did not just refer to Han areas.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20140325231543/https://webspace.utexas.edu/hl4958/perspectives/Zhao%20-%20reinventing%20china.pdf Zhao 2006], pp. 11-12.</ref>

When the [[Dzungar–Qing Wars|Qing conquered Dzungaria]], they proclaimed that the new land which formerly belonged to the [[Oirats|Oirat]]-led [[Dzungar Khanate]] was now absorbed into China (''Dulimbai Gurun'') in a Manchu language memorial.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=6qFH-53_VnEC&dq=Dulimbai+gurun+land&pg=PA77 Dunnell 2004], p. 77.</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=6qFH-53_VnEC&dq=Dulimbai+gurun&pg=PA83 Dunnell 2004], p. 83.</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=_qtgoTIAiKUC&dq=steppes+mountains+rivers+Dzungar+unified+with+china&pg=PA503 Elliott 2001], p. 503.</ref>

The [[Yongzheng Emperor]] spoke out against the claim by anti-Qing rebels that the Qing dynasty were only the rulers of the Manchus and not of China, saying "The seditious rebels claim that we are the rulers of Manchus and only later penetrated central China to become its rulers. Their prejudices concerning the division of their and our country have caused many vitriolic falsehoods. What these rebels have not understood is the fact that it is for the Manchus the same as the birthplace is for the people of the [[Zhongyuan|Central Plain]]. [[Emperor Shun|Shun]] belonged to the [[Dongyi|Eastern Yi]], and [[King Wen of Zhou|King Wen]] to the [[Xirong|Western Yi]]. Does this fact diminish their virtues?"

According to Russian scholars S.V. Dmitriev and S.L. Kuzmin, despite the Qing dynasty's usage of the term "China", these empires were known officially by their respective dynastic name. Non-Han peoples considered themselves as subjects of the Yuan and Qing empires and did not necessarily equate them to "China". This resulted from different ways of the Yuan and Qing legitimization for different peoples in these empires.<ref>[https://www.academia.edu/7730158/%D0%94%D0%BC%D0%B8%D1%82%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%B5%D0%B2_%D0%A1.%D0%92._%D0%9A%D1%83%D0%B7%D1%8C%D0%BC%D0%B8%D0%BD_%D0%A1.%D0%9B._2012._%D0%A7%D1%82%D0%BE_%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B5_%D0%9A%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%B9_%D0%A1%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%B4%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B5_%D0%B3%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%83%D0%B4%D0%B0%D1%80%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B2%D0%BE_%D0%B2_%D0%B8%D1%81%D1%82%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B8%D1%87%D0%B5%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BC_%D0%BC%D0%B8%D1%84%D0%B5_%D0%B8_%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%B0%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B9_%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%B5_Dmitriev_S.V._Kuzmin_S.L._2012._What_is_China_The_Middle_State_in_historical_myth_and_real_policy_ Dmitriev, S.V. and Kuzmin, S.L. 2012.

==Criticism==
Certain traits assigned by past scholars to "conquest dynasties" to distinguish them from "native" dynasties may not have been so distinguishing. An example is the "royal hunt",{{Explain|date=January 2022}} which, according to David M. Robinson, "originated in China in a complex legacy of venerable [[Zhongyuan|Central Plain]] polities of high antiquity."<ref>Roger des Forges, [http://www.cuhk.edu.hk/ics/journal/articles/v60p299.pdf (Review)] ''Journal of Chinese Studies'' No. 60 – (January 2015) pp. 302-303.</ref>

== List of non-Han dynasties ==
This list includes only the major dynasties of China ruled by non-Han ethnicities, there were many other such dynastic regimes that ruled an area historically or currently associated with "China" not shown in this list. Also, not all non-Han regimes are seen as conquest dynasties, and many of them are actually considered as "infiltration dynasties".

Shi Jingtang actually claimed to be a descendant of Chinese historical figures [[Shi Que]] and [[Shi Fen]], and insisted that his ancestors went westwards towards non-[[Han Chinese]] area during the political chaos at the end of the [[Han Dynasty]] in the early 3rd century.</ref><br/>{{lang|zh-Hant|後晉}}
