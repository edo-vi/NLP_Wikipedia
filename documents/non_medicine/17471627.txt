A '''clostridial vaccine''' is a [[vaccine]] for sheep and cattle that protects against diseases caused by toxins produced by an infection with one or more ''[[Clostridium]]'' bacteria.<ref name="Duncanson">{{cite book |last1=Duncanson |first1=Graham R. |title=Veterinary Treatment of Sheep and Goats |date=2012 |page=97 |publisher=CABI |isbn=9781780640051 |chapter=Vaccines for sheep. Clostridial diseases |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ynUPNHXayHQC&pg=PA97}}</ref> Clostridial vaccines are often administered to pregnant ewes a few weeks before they are due to give birth, in order to give [[passive immunity]] to their lambs.<ref name="Duncanson" /> Clostridial bacteria multiply rapidly in infected sheep, and produce large amounts of toxin which can cause the sheep to die within hours.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Scott |first1=Phillip R. |title=Sheep Medicine |date=2006 |publisher=CRC Press |isbn=9781840765366 |page=125 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=whhp7rIQru0C&pg=PA125 |chapter=Clostridial diseases}}</ref>
