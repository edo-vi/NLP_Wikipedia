To quote his apprentice, Darryl Patton:

<blockquote>There are many 'Herbalists' around recommending all sorts of strange herbal treatments. But they have absolutely no knowledge of what a medicinal plant looks like in the woods and outside of a bottle. These herbal "pharmacists" come and go like every other fad. Tommie and those who follow in his footsteps will continue to use simple herbs for healing.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.stalkingthewild.com/sh/tommie_newsletter.html |title=The Southern Herbalist: Mountain Medicine - the Herbal Remedies of Tommie Bass |accessdate=2007-06-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070701215648/http://www.stalkingthewild.com/sh/tommie_newsletter.html |archivedate=2007-07-01 }} Darryl Patton.
