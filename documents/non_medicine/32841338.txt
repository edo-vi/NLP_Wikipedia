'''''Ungulate bocaparvovirus 1''''', formerly '''''Bovine parvovirus''''' ('''BPV'''), also known as '''Haemadsorbing enteric Virus''', is a member of the [[Parvoviridae|parvovirus]] group, with three significant sub-species: BPV1, 2 and 3.  BPV most commonly causes [[diarrhea]] in neonatal calves and respiratory and reproductive disease in adult [[cattle]]. The distribution of the virus is worldwide. Transmission is both [[Vertical transmission|vertical]] (transplacental route) and [[Horizontal transmission|horizontal]] ([[Fecal-oral route|oro-fecal route]]). The virus is very resistant to chemical and physical challenges.

==Clinical signs and diagnosis==
Diarrhea is often the only clinical sign in neonatal calves. Reproductive infection causes [[abortion]] and the birth of weak or stillborn calves. Respiratory signs such as coughing, dyspnea, and nasal discharge also can occur.

The clinical signs of BPV may be made worse by concurrent GI infections.

[[Immunofluorescence]] (IF), [[Polymerase chain reaction|PCR]], [[Agglutination|hemagglutination]], [[ELISA]] and [[electron microscopy]] can be used to identify the virus.

Aborted fetuses are edematous and have increased pleural and peritoneal fluid. Immunofluorescence (IF) can be used to detect the virus in fetal organs. [[Autopsy|Postmortem examination]] of infected calves should show intestinal lesions.

==Treatment and control==
Treatment and control is achieved by [[vaccination]] of the dams during [[gestation]]. Appropriate hygiene and disinfection methods should also be employed.
