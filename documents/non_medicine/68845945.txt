Thus, it has become a pro-war symbol.

On 6 March the FIG announced that they will ask the Gymnastics Ethics Foundation to open disciplinary proceedings against Kuliak.<ref>{{cite web |title=Incident at the Doha World Cup – FIG statement |url=https://www.gymnastics.sport/site/news/displaynews.php?idNews=3445 |publisher=International Gymnastics Federation|date=6 March 2022|access-date=7 March 2022|website=gymnastics.sport}}</ref> In a subsequent interview, on Tuesday 8 March, Kuliak said that he had no regrets and would "do exactly the same".<ref>{{cite web|last= Ingle| first= Sean| title= Unrepentant gymnast Ivan Kuliak would show 'Z' insignia for Russia again| url= https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/08/gymnast-ivan-kuliak-says-he-would-show-support-for-russia-again| date= 8 March 2022| work= [[The Guardian]]| accessdate= 8 March 2022 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |author=Ben Church |title=Russian gymnast Ivan Kuliak says he has no regrets about wearing |url=https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/09/sport/ivan-kuliak-no-regrets-russia-ukraine-spt-intl/index.html |access-date=2022-04-29 |website=CNN}}</ref> On 18 March, he appeared at the [[2022 Moscow rally]] wearing an Olympic medal, though he has not competed in the Olympics.<ref name="Bondar">{{cite news |last=Bondar |first=Gregory |date=23 March 2022 |title=Олімпійський чемпіон Верняєв висміяв спортсмена з РФ, який вийшов на мітинг на підтримку війни з чужою медаллю |url=https://sport.unian.ua/othersports/oleg-vernyayev-vismiyav-sportsmena-z-rf-yakiy-viyshov-na-miting-na-pidtrimku-viyni-z-chuzhoyu-medallyu-novyny-sportu-11756380.html |work=The UNIAN |location=Kyiv, Ukraine |access-date=26 March 2022}}</ref>

On 17 May the FIG sanctioned Kuliak with a one-year ban, ending 17 May 2023 or six months after the ban on Russian athletes is lifted and ruled that he is to be stripped of his bronze medal and prize money.<ref name=kuliak-may17>{{cite web|url=https://www.gymnastics.sport/site/news/displaynews.php?urlNews=3505962|title=Russian gymnast sanctioned with one year ban by the Disciplinary Commission|date=May 17, 2022|work=[[International Gymnastics Federation]]}}</ref>

On 14 September it was announced that Kuliak's appeal against his suspension was partially upheld. The Gymnastics Ethics Foundation (GEF) Appeal Tribunal found that the one-year sanctions should be independent from measures preventing Russian gymnasts from competing at FIG events. This means his suspension would last until May 16, 2023.<ref name=kuliak-appeal>{{cite web|url=https://www.gymnastics.sport/site/news/displaynews.php?urlNews=3613326|title=GEF Appeal Tribunal partially upholds the appeal filed by a Russian gymnast|date=September 14, 2022|work=[[International Gymnastics Federation]]}}</ref>
