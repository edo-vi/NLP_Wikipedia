'''In ovo''' is Latin for '''in the egg'''. In medical usage it refers to the growth of live virus in chicken egg embryos for vaccine development for human use, as well as an effective method for vaccination of poultry against various [[Avian influenza]] and [[coronavirus]]es. During the [[Incubator (culture)|incubation period]], the virus replicates in the cells that make up the [[chorioallantoic membrane]].<ref name="Ricks_1999">{{cite journal | vauthors = Ricks CA, Avakian A, Bryan T, Gildersleeve R, Haddad E, Ilich R, King S, Murray L, Phelps P, Poston R, Whitfill C, Williams C | display-authors = 6 | title = In ovo vaccination technology | journal = Advances in Veterinary Medicine | volume = 41 | issue =  | pages = 495–515 | date = 1999 | pmid = 9890038 | doi =  10.1016/S0065-3519(99)80037-8}}</ref><ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web | vauthors = Hickling J, D'Hondt E | title = A review of production technologies for influenza virus vaccines, and their suitability for deployment in developing countries for influenza pandemic preparedness. | work = World Health Organization Initiative for Vaccine Research. | date = December 2006 | pages = 1–34 |url=http://who.int/vaccine_research/diseases/influenza/Flu_vacc_manuf_tech_report.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101008194753/http://who.int/vaccine_research/diseases/influenza/Flu_vacc_manuf_tech_report.pdf|archive-date=2010-10-08 }}</ref>

== Advantages ==

In human vaccine development, the main advantage is rapid propagation, and high yield, of viruses for vaccine production. This method is most commonly used for growth of influenza virus, both [[attenuated vaccine]] and [[inactivated vaccine]] forms. It is recommended by the [[World Health Organization]] in managing influenza pandemics because it is high-yield and cost effective. <ref name="autogenerated1"/>

In poultry, In ovo vaccination improves hatchability and efficient protection against [[Avian influenza]] (AI), [[Newcastle disease]] (ND) and [[Coronavirus]]es (Av-CoV). Seroconversion rates of chickens vaccinated as embryos ranged from 27% to 100% with ND vaccination and 85% to 100% for AI vaccination. The birds are protected before delivery to a commercial operation such as a farm, thus preventing the spread of Avian viruses.<ref name="Cai_2011">{{cite journal | vauthors = Cai Y, Song H, Ye J, Shao H, Padmanabhan R, Sutton TC, Perez DR | title = Improved hatchability and efficient protection after in ovo vaccination with live-attenuated H7N2 and H9N2 avian influenza viruses | journal = Virology Journal | volume = 8 | issue =  | pages = 31 | date = January 2011 | pmid = 21255403 | pmc = 3032716 | doi = 10.1186/1743-422X-8-31 }}</ref><ref name="Stone_1997">{{cite journal | vauthors = Stone H, Mitchell B, Brugh M | title = In ovo vaccination of chicken embryos with experimental Newcastle disease and avian influenza oil-emulsion vaccines | journal = Avian Diseases | volume = 41 | issue = 4 | pages = 856–863 | date = 1997 | pmid = 9454919 | doi =  10.2307/1592339| jstor = 1592339 }}</ref>

== Vaccination ==

In ovo vaccination is carried out by machines. These machines perform a number of actions to ensure good vaccination of the chick inside the egg. Benefits of In ovo vaccination include avoidance of bird stress, controlled hygienic conditions, and earlier immunity with less interference from maternal antibodies. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thepoultrysite.com/poultrynews/23983/inovo-vaccination-benefits-for-small-hatcheries/ |title=In-Ovo Vaccination: Benefits for Small Hatcheries | work = The Poultry Site }}</ref>

== Feeding ==
[[File:Applications- In ovo technology.jpg|center|thumb|619x619px|The ''in ovo'' inoculations could be aimed to stimulate or feed the embryos<ref name=":0" />]]
''In ovo'' feeding is a considered as a potential tool to provide nutrient to embryo as well as to modulate performance and gut health of pre and post hatched chicks.<ref name=":0" /> Based on the purpose the ''in ovo'' injection could be considered as ''in ovo'' stimulation or ''in ovo'' feeding.<ref name=":0" />
