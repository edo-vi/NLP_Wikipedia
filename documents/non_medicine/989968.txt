== Periods of historical ''Pax Sinica'' ==

=== Han dynasty ===
The first period of ''Pax Sinica'' came into being during the [[Han dynasty]] of China.<ref name=Han1>{{cite book|last1=Morris|first1=Ian|title=War!

== Possible return and obstacles ==

A resurgence of the term has been observed in recent years, especially after 2010, as China has not been involved in any significant military conflict since the [[Sino-Vietnamese War]] in 1979. The rapid rise of the People's Republic of China is seen by some analysts as a possible return to ''Pax Sinica'', as the [[economy of China]] continues to expand into the largest national economy in the world. <ref name=":0">{{cite news | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1576831,00.html | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070114062833/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1576831,00.html | url-status = dead | archive-date = January 14, 2007 | title = China Takes On the World | publisher = [[Time Magazine]] |date=2007-01-22 | first=Michael | last=Elliott}}</ref><ref name=":1">http://glavkonstruktor.ru/upload/img/ADFQtcg.png {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211231015900/http://glavkonstruktor.ru/upload/img/ADFQtcg.png |date=2021-12-31 }} {{Bare URL image|date=March 2022}}</ref><ref name=":2">{{cite news |url = https://www.economist.com/asia/2014/09/20/pax-sinica |title = Pax Sinica |date = 2014-09-20 |newspaper = The Economist |access-date = 2019-10-21 |issn = 0013-0613 }}</ref><ref name=":3">{{cite web |url=http://chinapower.csis.org/how-is-china-shaping-the-global-economic-order/ |title=How is China shaping the global economic order? |date=9 March 2016 |publisher=CSIS China Power |access-date=24 December 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160920025142/http://chinapower.csis.org/how-is-china-shaping-the-global-economic-order/ |archive-date=20 September 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref> A forecast by the British-based [[Centre for Economics and Business Research]] has stated that China is set to overtake the United States as the world's biggest economy by 2028, half a decade sooner than expected.<ref name="CHN1">{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/dec/26/china-to-overtake-us-as-worlds-biggest-economy-by-2028-report-predicts |title=China to overtake US as world's biggest economy by 2028, report predicts |last=Elliot |first=Larry |date=26 December 2020 |website=[[The Guardian]] |access-date=28 December 2020 |quote="With the US expected to contract by 5% this year, China will narrow the gap with its biggest rival, the CEBR said.

China's economic development is tied to its large, working population and continuous, rapid industrialization, so much so that China has overtaken most Western nations in exports of finished goods and technological products. However, the [[aging of China|aging of China's population]] could create challenging social issues, increase the risk of social instability, and limit its capabilities to act as a new global hegemon.<ref name="thea_The_Responsibility">{{Cite web |title=The Responsibility to Counter China's Ambitions Falls to Us |last=Sasse |first=Ben |publisher=[[The Atlantic]] |date=January 26, 2020 |access-date=February 4, 2021 |url= https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/01/china-sasse/605074/}}</ref>
