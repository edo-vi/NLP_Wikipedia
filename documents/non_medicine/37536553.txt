An '''oracionista''' is a specific type of [[curandero|curandera]] who works through prayer and prayer songs (oraciones) to heal the sick.  As with other methods of modern [[Curandero|curanderismo]], this form of prayer healing is heavily influenced by Roman Catholicism as well as the indigenous traditions of a given region. The ability to heal is thought to work through a spiritual gift known as “el don”. The oracionista is thought to have received her healing gift through an apprenticeship, family lineage or visionary experience.
