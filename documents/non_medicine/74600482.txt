[[File:Bombykol Structure V.1.svg|thumb|Structural formula of [[Bombykol|bombycol]], the first clearly chemically identified insect pheromone]]
'''Insect pheromones''' are [[neurotransmitter]]s that serve the chemical communication between individuals of an insect [[species]]. They thus differ from [[kairomone]]s, in other words, neurotransmitters that transmit information to non-species organisms. Insects produce pheromones in special [[gland]]s and release them into the environment. In the pheromone receptors of the sensory cells of the recipient, they produce a nerve [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimulus]] even in very low concentrations, which ultimately leads to a behavioral response. [[Biological specificity|Intraspecific]] communication of insects via these substances takes place in a variety of ways and serves, among other things, to find sexual partner, to maintain harmony in a [[Colony (biology)|colony]] of [[Eusociality|socially living insects]], to mark territories or to find nest sites and food sources.

In 1959, the German biochemist and Nobel Prize winner Adolf Butenandt identified and synthesized the [[Saturated and unsaturated compounds|unsaturated]] [[fatty alcohol]] bombycol, the sex pheromone of the [[Bombyx mori|domestic silk moth]] (''Bombyx mori''), as the first known insect pheromone. The sex pheromones of female [[Butterfly|butterflies]] are mostly mono- or bis-[[olefinic]] [[fatty acid]]s or their [[ester]]s, fatty alcohols, their esters or the corresponding [[aldehyde]]s. Male butterflies use a wide range of chemicals as sex pheromones, for example [[pyrrolizidine alkaloid]]s, [[terpene]]s and [[aromatic compound]]s such as [[benzaldehyde]].

Research into the chemical communication of insects is expanding our understanding of how they locate their food sources or places to lay eggs. For example, beekeepers use an artificially produced [[Nasonov pheromone|Nasanov pheromone]] containing terpenes such as [[geraniol]] and [[citral]] to attract bees to an unused [[Beehive|hive]]. The agriculture and forestry industries use insect pheromones commercially in [[pest control]] using [[insect trap]]s to prevent egg laying and in practicing the [[mating disruption]]. It is expected that insect pheromones can also contribute in this way to the control of insect-borne infectious diseases such as [[malaria]], [[Dengue fever|dengue]] fever or [[African trypanosomiasis]].

== Etymology and classification ==
Adolf Butenandt and [[Peter Karlson]] proposed the term pheromones in 1959 for substances that serve intraspecific communication.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Karlson |first1=Peter |last2=Butenandt |first2=Adolf |year=1959 |title=Pheromones (Ectohormones) in Insects |journal=Annual Review of Entomology |volume=4 |pages=39–58 |doi=10.1146/annurev.en.04.010159.000351}}</ref> The definition of the term pheromone was given in the same year by Karlson and the Swiss zoologist [[Martin Lüscher]]. According to this, pheromones are<blockquote>"Substances released externally by one individual that elicit specific responses in another individual of the same species."

– Peter Karlson, Martin Lüscher, 1959.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal |last1=Karlson |first1=Peter |last2=Lüscher |first2=Martin |year=1959 |title=Pheromones: a New Term for a Class of Biologically Active Substances |journal=Nature |volume=183 |issue=4653 |pages=55–56 |doi=10.1038/183055a0 |pmid=13622694 |bibcode=1959Natur.183...55K |s2cid=4243699 }}</ref></blockquote>The word pheromone consists of the [[ancient Greek]] parts of speech ''φέρειν phérein'', ''überbringen'', ''melden'', and ''ὁρμᾶν hormān, antreiben, erregen''.<ref name=":0" /><ref>{{Cite book |last=Gemoll |first=Wilhelm |title=Griechisch-Deutsches Schul- und Handwörterbuch.

It was to be a short word that could be spoken in many languages. The ending mone served as a [[suffix]], as it occurs in the words [[hormone]], [[kairomone]], and [[allomone]] thus emphasizing their relationship.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Karlson |first1=Peter |last2=Lüscher |first2=Martin |year=1959 |title=The Proposed Biological Term "Pheromone |journal=Nature |volume=183 |issue=4678 |pages=1835 |doi=10.1038/1831835b0|bibcode=1959Natur.183.1835K |doi-access=free }}</ref> The term pheromone replaced the term ectohormone or homoiohormone, which Albrecht Bethe had already proposed in 1932 with the same definition.<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal |last=Bethe |first=Albrecht |year=1932 |title=Vernachlässigte Hormone |journal=Die Naturwissenschaften |volume=20 |issue=11 |pages=177–181 |doi=10.1007/BF01504737|bibcode=1932NW.....20..177B |s2cid=40051319 }}</ref> Bethe's term was not accepted because, according to Butenandt, the terms ecto and hormone were mutually exclusive. The mechanism of action of a pheromone also does not correspond to that of a hormone absorbed into the [[circulatory system]] by another individual and was therefore considered misleading.

The classification of intraspecific pheromones in the group of [[semiochemical]]s, in other words, [[neurotransmitter]]s that serve communication between organisms, is shown in the following diagram:<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Nordlund |first1=D.

Karlson further divided them into the [[sense of smell]] and the [[Anatomical terms of location|oral-acting]] insect pheromones according to the mode of reception.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Karlson |first1=Peter |last2=Lüscher |first2=Martin |year=1959 |title=Pheromone |journal=Die Naturwissenschaften |volume=46 |issue=2 |pages=63–64 |doi=10.1007/BF00599084|bibcode=1959NW.....46...63K }}</ref> In 1963, [[E. O. Wilson|Edward O. Wilson]], who had discovered [[ant]] trace pheromones the year before, and William H.

Primerpheromones, for example, suppress the formation of ovaries in [[worker bee]]s.

Often, pheromones are defined according to their behavior-triggering function. In addition to the well-known sex attractants, they act, among other things, as [[Pheromone|aggregation pheromones]], dispersion pheromones, alarm pheromones, tracking pheromones, marker pheromones, brood recognition pheromones, egg-laying pheromones, recruitment pheromones, or as caste recognition agents.

[[Vincent Dethier]] divided insect pheromones into six categories according to their general behavior-triggering effects.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Dethier |first1=Vincent G. |last2=Browne |first2=Barton L. |year=1960 |title=The Designation of Chemicals in Terms of the Responses They Elicit from Insects 1 |journal=Journal of Economic Entomology |volume=53 |issue=1 |pages=134–136|doi=10.1093/jee/53.1.134 }}</ref> These include prisoners, which are normally only perceptible at short distances and cause an insect in motion to stop, and locomotor stimulants, which increase the insect's speed or decrease the number of directional changes. ''Lockstoffe'' are attractants that trigger an oriented movement toward the odor source, whereas repellents trigger an escape movement away from it. Feeding and oviposition stimulants, respectively, trigger feeding or oviposition. Deterrents, on the other hand, inhibit feeding or oviposition.

Functionally defined insect pheromones often contain mixtures of different components in precisely defined proportions. These so-called pheromone cocktails often contain substances of different categories with near and far orientation functions. For example, the aggregation pheromone cocktail of the [[German cockroach]] ''Blattella germanica'' contains both substances that act as attractants and substances that act as arrestants.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Sakuma |first1=Masayuki |last2=Fukami |first2=Hiroshi |year=1993 |title=Aggregation arrestant pheromone of the German cockroach, Blattella germanica (L.)

In part, insect pheromones are named after the site of their biological production. Males of various moth species, such as the banana butterfly, possess so-called androconial organs in the abdomen that release pheromones. These insect pheromones are appropriately called androconial pheromones.<ref>Bonnie Blaimer: ''[http://www.fzi.uni-freiburg.de/de/47.php Zur Struktur und Funktion der androconialen Organe und Sekrete bei Brassolini (Lepidoptera)].''

== History ==

=== First discoveries ===
[[File:John Ray from NPG.jpg|thumb|227x227px|John Ray ]]
In 1609, the English [[beekeeper]] [[Charles Butler (beekeeper)|Charles Butler]] observed that the sting of a [[bee]] released a liquid. This liquid attracted other bees, which then began to sting en masse.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Nordlund |first1=Donald A. |last2=Lewis |first2=W. J. |year=1976 |title=Terminology of chemical releasing stimuli in intraspecific and interspecific interactions |journal=Journal of Chemical Ecology |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=211–220 |doi=10.1007/BF00987744|s2cid=20085075 }}</ref> Butler thus demonstrated for the first time the effect of an alarm pheromone of bees, which was identified as [[isoamyl acetate]] in the 1960s.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Free |first1=J.

As early as 1690, Sir [[John Ray]] suspected that [[peppered moth]]s attracted male conspecifics by means of a scent:<blockquote>“It emerged out of a stick-shaped geometer caterpillar: it was a female and came out from its chrysalis shut up in my cage: the windows were open in the room or closet where it was kept, and two male moths flying round were caught by my wife who by a lucky chance were into the room in the night: they were attracted, as it seems to me, by the scent of the female and came in from outside.”

"It developed from a stick-shaped birch moth caterpillar: it was a female, and came out of her chrysalis, which was shut up in my cage: the windows were open in the room or chamber where she was kept, and two male moths flying about were caught by my wife, who by a lucky chance was in the room that night: they were attracted, it seems to me, by the scent of the female, and came in from outside."

– John Ray<ref>{{Cite book |last=Raven |first=Charles E. |title=John Ray, Naturalist: His Life and Works |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1950 |page=395}}</ref></blockquote>
[[File:Jean-henri fabre.jpg|thumb|Jean-Henri Fabre]]
The French [[Entomology|entomologist]] [[Jean-Henri Fabre]] also reported in the mid-19th century on experiments with ''Saturnia'' and [[Lasiocampa quercus|oak eggar]] in which females trapped in wire cages attracted hundreds of males within a few days at specific times.<ref name=":3">{{Cite journal |last=Butenandt |first=Adolf |year=1962 |title=Fettalkohole als Sexual-Lockstoffe der Schmetterlinge |journal=Fette, Seifen, Anstrichmittel |volume=64 |issue=3 |pages=187–192 |doi=10.1002/lipi.19620640302}}</ref> In experiments with tagged [[Bombyx mori|domestic silk moth]], 40% of males from a distance of four kilometers and 26% of males from eleven kilometers still found their way to a trapped female.<ref name=":3" /> The morphology of the moths was also reported in the mid-19th century.

In many insect species, researchers long puzzled over the mechanism of mating: visual or acoustic stimuli could not explain Fabre's experiments, nor how moths found females ready to mate with great certainty. Theories of attraction by [[infrared]] or other radiation were not confirmed.<ref name=":3" /> The organization of [[eusociality]] remained equally inexplicable for a long time. The writer and bee researcher [[Maurice Maeterlinck]] speculated about the spirit of the hive, the (team) Spirit of the hive, without being able to determine its essence in more detail.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Maeterlinck |first=Maurice |date=1901-05-01 |title=The Life of the Bee |journal=Projekt Gutenberg}}</ref> Theories about the attraction by infrared or radiation also remained unexplained for a long time.

=== Definitions of Bethe ===
At the beginning of the 20th century, [[Ernest Starling]] discovered [[hormone]]s as the first biological neurotransmitters.<ref>Bayliss, W. M.; Starling, E. H. (1906). "Die chemische Koordination der Funktionen des Körpers". ''[[:de:Reviews_of_Physiology,_Biochemistry_and_Pharmacology|Ergebnisse der Physiologie]]''. '''5''': 664–697. [[Doi (identifier)|doi]]:10.1007/BF02321027.</ref> In 1932, the [[Neurophysiology|neurophysiologist]] [[Albrecht Bethe]], who at that time headed the Institute of [[Physiology|Animal Physiology]] at the [[Goethe University Frankfurt]], published an article on an expanded hormone concept in which he distinguished between endohormones and ectohormones.<ref name=":1" /> According to this, endohormones act in the producing organism itself and correspond to the classical hormone definition. In contrast, the organism releases ectohormones externally and transfers them to other individuals. As an example, Bethe cited the effect of the [[Lactation|lactation hormone]], which is released by a [[fetus]] to its mother and causes the growth of the [[mammary gland]] and subsequently the [[Secretion|secretion of milk]].<ref name=":1" /> He also proposed this concept for chemical communication among insects.<blockquote>"In bees, for example, the workers (i.e. not the mothers) are able to raise a sexually capable queen from an egg or a young larva [...] by special food and transfer of secretions of their salivary glands. There can hardly be any doubt (although it has not been proven) that ectohormones of the salivary gland secretions play the main role in this redifferentiation."

– Albrecht Bethe[6]</blockquote>Bethe further divided the ectohormones into homoiohormones, which – according to today's definition of a pheromone – act on individuals of the same species, and alloiohormones, which act on individuals of a different species. He thus coined the precursor term of [[Allelopathy|allelochemicals]].<ref name=":1" />

=== Works from Butenandt ===
Adolf Butenandt also suspected that communication among insects was based on neurotransmitters, and in the 1940s he began a project to identify the sexual attractant of the domestic silk moth (''Bombyx mori''). It is a butterfly originally native to China, belonging to the [[Family (biology)|family]] of the [[Bombycidae]], which is used for [[sericulture]] and its breeding and keeping was well known. It was only after almost 20 years of work that he finally succeeded in [[Extraction (chemistry)|extracting]] and purifying a substance from more than 500,000 insects, which Butenandt later named [[Bombykol]].

By [[elemental analysis]], Butenandt determined the [[chemical formula]] of the substance to be C<sub>16</sub>H<sub>30</sub>O. [[Infrared spectroscopy correlation table|Infrared spectroscopic]] studies indicated the presence of [[Conjugated system|conjugated double bonds]]. Using methods common at the time, such as catalytic [[hydrogenation]], [[Melting point|melting point determination]], and oxidative degradation by [[potassium permanganate]], Butenandt showed that the substance sought was an [[Saturated and unsaturated compounds|unsaturated]] [[fatty alcohol]], (10''E'',12''Z'')-10,12-Hexadecadien-1-ol.<ref>Butenandt, Adolf; Beckmann, Rüdiger; Stamm, D. (1959). "Über den Sexuallockstoff des Seidenspinners". ''[[Zeitschrift für Naturforschung B]]''. '''14''': 283–284.</ref>

Butenandt then synthesized bombycol from [[vernolic acid]] [(12''R'',13''S'')-Epoxy-9-''cis''-octadecenoic acid] in several steps via diol formation, its cleavage to the [[aldehyde]], [[Double bond|double bond isomerization]], and [[Wittig reaction]]. He synthesized the four possible [[Stereoisomerism|stereoisomers]] and tested them for their [[biological activity]].<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Butenandt |first1=Adolf |last2=Hecker |first2=Erich |last3=Hopp |first3=Manfred |last4=Koch |first4=Wolfgang |year=1962 |title=Über den Sexuallockstoff des Seidenspinners, IV.

Butenandt thus provided evidence that communication among insects takes place on a substance-by-substance basis.<blockquote>"By extraction and condensation experiments, however, it has been convincingly shown that a material principle must be present which is secreted by the female butterflies from scent organs of the last abdominal segments and perceived by the males with their antennae."

=== Primer and releaser pheromones ===
[[File:Plos wilson.jpg|thumb|E. O. Wilson]]
Towards the end of the 1950s, [[E. O. Wilson|Edward O. Wilson]] defined substances that trigger the alarm and burrowing behavior of ants as chemical releaser.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Wilson |first=Edward O. |year=1958 |title=A Chemical Releaser of Alarm and Digging Behavior in the Ant Pogonomyrmex Badius (Latreille) |journal=Psyche: A Journal of Entomology |volume=65 |issue=2–3 |pages=41–51 |doi=10.1155/1958/57483 |doi-access=free }}</ref> In 1961, the British [[biochemist]] [[Kenneth Callow|Robert Kenneth Callow]] identified another pheromone, also known as the queen bee pheromone, with the compound [[(E)-9-oxo-dec-2-enoic acid|(''E'')-9-oxo-dec-2-enoic acid]], or ''9-ODA'' for short.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Butler |first1=C.

In 1963, Wilson, who the year before had already discovered the trace pheromones of ants, and William H. Bossert introduced the term releaser and primer pheromones for this purpose, to distinguish the behavior-controlling effect of, for example, sex attractants from the pheromones that interfere with the [[endocrine system]] of the receiver.<ref name=":2" /><ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Wilson |first1=Edward O. |last2=Bossert |first2=William H. |year=1963 |title=Chemical communication among animals |journal=Recent Progress in Hormone Research |volume=19 |pages=673–716 |pmid=14284035 }}</ref>

=== Modern research directions ===
[[File:Helicoverpa zea1.jpg|thumb|Preparation of ''[[:de:Baumwollkapselbohrer|Helicoverpa zea]]'']]
As a result of the enormously refined extraction and [[analytical chemistry]] over the years, chemists and biologists identified numerous other pheromones. For the detection of the second component of the pheromone cocktail of ''Bombyx mori'', the bombycal [(10''Z'',12''E'')-hexadecadienal], an extract of 460 glands from which 15 [[Orders of magnitude (mass)|nanograms]] of the aldehyde were isolated was already sufficient in 1978.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Kasang |first1=Gerhard |last2=Kaißling |first2=Karl Ernst |last3=Vostrowsky |first3=Otto |last4=Bestmann |first4=Hans Jürgen |year=1978 |title=Bombykal, eine zweite Pheromonkomponente des Seidenspinners Bombyx mori L |journal=Angewandte Chemie |volume=90 |issue=1 |pages=74–75 |doi=10.1002/ange.19780900132|bibcode=1978AngCh..90...74K }}</ref>

In addition to studying the function and reception of pheromones and their chemical identification, scientists extensively investigated the [[biochemistry]] of pheromone production. In 1984, Ashok Raina and Jerome Klun discovered that the production of the female sex attractant of the [[Noctuidae|owlet moths]] ''[[Helicoverpa zea]]'' is controlled by hormonal substances called pheromone biosynthesis-activating neuropeptides (PBANs) in the brains of female moths.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Raina |first1=Ashok K. |last2=Klun |first2=Jerome A. |year=1984 |title=Brain Factor Control of Sex Pheromone Production in the Female Corn Earworm Moth |journal=Science |volume=225 |issue=4661 |pages=531–533 |doi=10.1126/science.225.4661.531|pmid=17750856 |bibcode=1984Sci...225..531R |s2cid=40949867 }}</ref> Other modern research focuses on the study of insect pheromone reception by means of the sense of smell and taste, genetic factors, and evolutionary biology issues, such as the [[coevolution]] of female sex pheromone production and reception in the male.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Löfstedt |first=C. |year=1989 |title=No linkage between genes controlling female pheromone production and male pheromone response in the European corn borer, Ostrinia nubilalis Hübner (Lepidoptera; Pyralidae) |journal=Genetics |volume=123 |issue=3 |pages=553–556|doi=10.1093/genetics/123.3.553 |pmid=2599367 |pmc=1203827 }}</ref>

Combating disease vectors such as ''[[Anopheles]]'' is another focus of research. According to [[World Health Organization]] estimates, the number of malaria infections in 2012 was about 207 million with 627,000 deaths.<ref>''[https://www.who.int/news-room/facts-in-pictures/detail/malaria 10 facts on malaria].''

== Production ==
The pheromones in insects are often the secondary products of fatty acids, such as saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbons, fatty alcohols, esters and aldehydes, but also isoprenoids and other compounds. Pheromones are often not pure substances, but so-called pheromone cocktails consisting of various components. Often, only one specific enantiomer of a compound triggers a behavioral reaction, while the other enantiomer triggers no reaction or a different reaction.

Sometimes the biosynthesis of the pheromone occurs only when the biochemical precursors in the form of certain alkaloids have been ingested from food plants. In this case, the sex pheromone simultaneously signals the presence of food sources.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Boppre |first1=Michael |last2=Schneider |first2=Dietrich |year=1985 |title=Pyrrolizidine alkaloids quantitatively regulate both scent organ morphogenesis and pheromone biosynthesis in male Creatonotos moths (Lepidoptera: Arctiidae) |journal=Journal of Comparative Physiology A |volume=157 |issue=5 |pages=569–577 |doi=10.1007/BF01351351|s2cid=26225408 }}</ref>

Due to the potential commercial application in crop protection, the intensity of the study of pheromones increased greatly after Butenandt's discovery, leading to the development of highly sensitive analytical methods<ref name="Athula B.

Insect pheromones are produced by a variety of [[exocrine gland]]s consisting primarily of modified [[Epidermis|epidermal cells]] at various sites on the insect body.

Rather than evolving a completely unique set of [[enzyme]]s for pheromone biosynthesis, insects often modify normal metabolites into pheromones with high regio-, chemo-, (''E/Z'')-, diastereo-, or enantioselectivity and in well-defined ratios.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Tillman |first1=Julie A. |last2=Seybold |first2=Steven J. |last3=Jurenka |first3=Russell A. |last4=Blomquist |first4=Gary J. |year=1999 |title=Insect pheromones – an overview of biosynthesis and endocrine regulation |journal=Insect Biochemistry and Molecular Biology |volume=29 |issue=6 |pages=481–514 |doi=10.1016/S0965-1748(99)00016-8|pmid=10406089 }}</ref> Biosynthesis of insect pheromones occurs either ''de novo'' following the scheme of [[fatty acid synthesis]] by successive addition of [[malonyl-CoA]] to an initial [[Acetyl group|acetyl]] or by uptake of [[Precursor (chemistry)|precursors]] from the diet.

Male [[Melanophila|fire-coloured beetles]] of the species ''[[Neopyrochroa flabellata]]'' and also various other beetle species use the [[terpenoid]] [[cantharidin]] as a sex pheromone and aphrodisiac pheromone, respectively. This [[Terpenoid|isoprenoid]] is ingested by ''Neopyrochroa flabellata'' with food and transferred to females and subsequently to the brood during the mating act.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Meinwald |first=Jerrold |year=1990 |title=Alkaloids and isoprenoids as defensive and signalling agents among insect |journal=Pure Appl.

[[File:Sesiidae Pheromon fg01.jpg|thumb|''[[Chamaesphecia empiformis]]'' on pheromone dispenser]]
Chemical communication between living beings by means of pheromones follows the same principles as technical [[Data communication|data transmission]]. A [[transmitter]], for example the [[gland]] of a female insect, emits the signal in the form of a chemical [[Substance theory|substance]]. Both the chemical structure of the [[molecule]]s and their quantity ratio determine the [[information content]] and serve as a [[Models of communication|model of communication]] for the species. The physical properties of the substances, such as [[vapor pressure]], determine the function of their molecules as short- or long-range information transmitters.<ref name=":9">{{Cite journal |last=Bestmann |first=Hans Jürgen |year=1985 |title=Synthese und Wirkungsweise von Pheromonen |journal=Information und Kommunikation. Naturwissenschaftliche, medizinische und technische Aspekte |location=Stuttgart |publisher=Wissenschaftliche Verlagsgesellschaft mbH |pages=301–316 |isbn=3-8047-0814-5}}</ref>

The insect pheromone is transmitted by direct contact or via a medium such as water or air. From the [[Shannon–Weaver model|receiver]], for example the [[Pheromone|pheromone receptors]] in the [[Antenna (biology)|antenna]] of a male insect, the substance is received and triggers a behavioral response. The term antenna was first used to refer to the antennae of insects and subsequently in engineering.<ref name=":10" /> Insect pheromones have a highly species-specific effect, meaning that they elicit the desired behavioral response only in [[biological specificity]] but not in individuals of other species. For example, although the chemical compounds that act as sex pheromones in butterflies may be the same in different species, the composition of the pheromone cocktail is different in all species.<ref name=":9" /> In addition, pheromone cocktails often contain substances that act as behavioral inhibitors for other species, such as significantly reducing the rate of approach of males of alien species to an attracting female.<ref name=":10">{{Cite journal |last=Priesner |first=Ernst |year=1985 |title=Pheromone als Sinnesreize |journal=Information und Kommunikation.

=== Physico-chemical properties ===
The pheromones are usually produced as a liquid and are either transmitted by direct contact or released into the environment as a liquid or [[vapor]]. They can be either heavy or [[Volatility (chemistry)|light volatile]]. Diffusivity significantly affects the function of the pheromone.<ref name=":11">{{Cite journal |last1=Bossert |first1=William H. |last2=Wilson |first2=Edward O. |year=1963 |title=The analysis of olfactory communication among animals |journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=443–469 |doi=10.1016/0022-5193(63)90089-4|pmid=5875169 |bibcode=1963JThBi...5..443B }}</ref> Alarm pheromones are often highly volatile to spread quickly by [[diffusion]]. Therefore, they are often short-chain substances with relatively high vapor pressure and low complexity.<ref name=":5" /> There is no high requirement for species-specific [[Code|coding]] effect as in sex pheromones. Sex pheromones have a higher complexity than most alarm pheromones, but a lower molar mass than marker pheromones, which permanently indicate an area.<ref name=":12">{{Cite book |last=Wyatt |first=Tristram D. |title=Pheromones and Animal Behaviour. Communication by Smell and Taste |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2003 |isbn=0-521-48526-6 |page=13}}</ref>

In the case of flying insects - such as butterflies - the pheromone as a molecule must not be too large, otherwise the [[vapor pressure]] and volatility are too low. Thus, over 200 identified sex pheromones of butterfly species are mono- and bis-olefinic [[fatty aldehyde]]s, fatty alcohols and their acetates with chains of 10 to 18 carbon atoms.<ref name=":5" />

Depending on the function, there are different emission and reception scenarios. Ants, for example, emit alarm pheromones intermittently or continuously in the usually windless environment of the anthill. Trace pheromones are emitted by an ant as a moving source. Silkmoth sex pheromones are emitted in discrete scent threads in an air stream.<ref name=":11" />
[[File:Danaus plexippus 001.jpg|thumb|[[Monarch butterfly|Monarch butterfly male]] with clearly visible scent scales pockets]]
Male monarch butterflies do not emit volatile pheromones, but pheromone-laden [[nanoparticle]]s called pheromone transfer particles, which they use to transfer arrestants or aphrodisiac pheromones to females. The pheromone transfer particles position the males on their brush hairs and scatter them during courtship flight. The nanoparticles adhere to the antennae of the females, which are equipped with pheromone receptors, where they slowly release the pheromones, resulting in a long-lasting stimulus for the female.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Boppré |first=Michael |year=1976 |title=Pheromon-Transfer-Partikel auf einem Duftpinselhaar eines Monarchfalters (Danaus formosa) |journal=Naturwissenschaftliche Rundschau |volume=29|issue=9 }}</ref>

Females of the [[Arctiinae]] ''[[Pyrrharctia isabella]]'' emit an [[aerosol]] consisting exclusively of sex pheromone droplets. The amount of pheromone released in this process is much greater than in other known female moths. The apparent wastefulness of the sex pheromone is explained by the short amount of time an adult has to find a reproductive partner due to the short Arctic spring.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Krasnoff |first1=Stuart B. |last2=Roelofs |first2=Wendell L. |year=1988 |title=Sex pheromone released as an aerosol by the moth Pyrrharctia isabella |journal=Nature |volume=333 |issue=6170 |pages=263–265 |doi=10.1038/333263a0|bibcode=1988Natur.333..263K |s2cid=4339228 }}</ref>

Recipients usually perceive pheromones in an environment characterized by the presence of many other chemicals. To ensure specific perception, the pheromone chemical must either be so complex that it does not occur more than once in nature, or the correct ratio of several individual components must trigger the stimulus. However, it has been shown that only in exceptional cases does a single substance convey the message. Often, a [[mixture]] of substances must be present in very precise proportions that, in addition to the chemical structure of the individual pheromones, determine the informational content of the pheromone cocktail.<ref name=":5" />
[[File:Periplanone B.png|thumb|Periplanon B]]
The chemical structure of pheromones is directly related to their signaling function and [[Signal-to-noise ratio|signaling environment]]. Pheromones released into the air often have a [[Catenation|carbon chain]] of 5 to 20 atoms and a [[molar mass]] of about 80 to 300 g-mol-1. With a carbon chain of less than five carbon atoms, the number of possible isomers is small and targeted species-specific coding is difficult.<ref name=":12" /> With longer carbon chains, the number of possible isomers increases rapidly.

[[Periplanone B|Periplanon B]], the sex pheromone of the [[American cockroach]], is an example of a complex single substance to which males respond at extremely low levels of 10<sup>−5</sup> [[Orders of magnitude (mass)|nanograms]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Cardé |first=Ring |title=Advances in Insect Chemical Ecology |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2011 |isbn=978-0-521-18893-7 |page=190}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Okada |first1=Kentaro |last2=Mori |first2=Masataka |last3=Shimazaki |first3=Kazuko |last4=Chuman |first4=Tatsuji |year=1990 |title=Behavioral responses of male Periplaneta americana L. to female sex pheromone components, periplanone-A and periplanone-B |journal=Journal of Chemical Ecology |volume=16 |issue=9 |pages=2605–2614 |doi=10.1007/BF00988072|pmid=24264316 |s2cid=30323914 }}</ref>

=== Biological properties ===
[[File:Antenna pectinate.jpg|thumb|Antenna of a [[Lasiocampidae]]]]
The sex pheromone cocktail emitted by a female insect spreads downwind. In the recipient male, the molecules strike the antennae, where reception of the pheromones takes place by means of olfactory cells on the olfactory hairs or [[Sensillum|sensilla]]. The antennae adsorb about 30% of the pheromone molecules contained in an airstream.<ref name=":10" /> The remaining molecules hit the outer [[Clothing|exoskeleton]] where they are enzymatically degraded.

The pheromone molecules first reach the [[cuticle]] of the olfactory hairs and diffuse through pores into a pore cone and from there into [[tubule]]s. From there, the molecules diffuse further to the [[Dendrite|dendritic membrane]].<ref name=":5" /> This membrane has receptors that, when a pheromone is received, cause a change in electrical resistance via the opening of [[ion channel]]s, creating an [[Electrical resistance and conductance|electrical resistance]] that results in a [[perception]].<ref name=":5" /> Even a single pheromone molecule can trigger a nerve impulse.[59] However, the recognition of a specific pheromone cocktail requires a certain level of excitation of different [[cell type]]s of varying [[Evaluation of binary classifiers|specificity]].<ref name=":10" /> It is assumed that the characteristic excitations received from the different receptors in the [[central nervous system]] are modulated there into an excitation pattern. If this excitation pattern, which depends on the quantitative ratio of the received pheromone molecules, matches the coding of an innate [[behavioral pattern]], this leads to the triggering of a corresponding behavioral response, such as the headwind approach to a pheromone source.<ref name=":9" />

== Pheromone species ==
According to their effect, two classes of pheromones can be distinguished, the primer and the releaser pheromones. Under certain conditions, certain pheromones act as both releaser and primer pheromones.<ref name=":13" />

=== Releaserpheromone ===
Releaser pheromones have a brief, immediate behavior-controlling effect. The first pheromone discovered, bombycol, is an example. Releaser pheromones typically include aggregation pheromones, dispersal pheromones, alarm pheromones, tracking pheromones, and marking pheromones, among others, in addition to the well-known sex pheromones.<ref name=":13">{{Cite journal |last1=Regnier |first1=Fred E. |last2=Law |first2=John H. |year=1968 |title=Insect pheromones |journal=Journal of Lipid Research |volume=9 |issue=5 |pages=541–551|doi=10.1016/S0022-2275(20)42699-9 |pmid=4882034 }}</ref>

==== Aggregation pheromones ====
[[File:Bug aggregation.jpg|thumb|Aggregation of [[Pentatomidae]]]]
Aggregation pheromones are produced by both sexes and are used for the sex-nonspecific attraction of individuals of the same species. These are known, for example, in the [[bark beetle]] and other beetle species, [[Bipedalism|bipeds]], [[hemiptera]] and [[grasshopper]]s. Insects use aggregation pheromones for defense against predators, in mate choice, and to overcome [[Host (biology)|host plant]] resistance to mass attack. A group of individuals at a site is referred to as an [[Aggregation (ethology)|aggregation]], regardless of sex.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Foster |first1=S. P. |last2=Harris |first2=M. O. |year=1997 |title=Behavioral manipulation Methods for Insect Pest-Management |journal=Annual Review of Entomology |volume=42 |pages=123–146 |doi=10.1146/annurev.ento.42.1.123|pmid=15012310 }}</ref> Aggregation pheromones, in addition to sex attractants, play a significant role in the development of pheromone traps for selective pest control.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Vite |first1=Jean Pierre |last2=Francke |first2=Wittko |year=1985 |title=Waldschutz gegen Borkenkäfer: Vom Fangbaum zur Falle |journal=Chemie in unserer Zeit |volume=19 |pages=11–21 |doi=10.1002/ciuz.19850190103}}</ref>

Studies using [[electroantennogram techniques]] showed that aggregation pheromones elicited relatively high receptor potentials in a sex-nonspecific manner, whereas sex pheromones elicited high receptor potentials in only one sex. Aggregation pheromones may therefore be evolutionary precursors of sex pheromones.<ref name=":4" />

==== Sex pheromones ====
{{See also|List of insect sex pheromones}}[[File:Joined moths.JPG|thumb|Copulating [[Laothoe populi|poplar hawk moth pair]]]]
Sex pheromones signal the female animal's readiness to [[mating]]. Male animals also emit pheromones; they contain information about sex and [[genotype]]. Many insects release sex pheromones; some butterfly species still perceive the pheromone at a distance of 10 kilometers. The sensory cell response in the male silkmoth begins at a concentration of about 1000 molecules per cubic centimeter of air.<ref name=":10" /> The scent signal of a female, as soon as a certain concentration threshold is exceeded, initially triggers an oriented headwind flight in the silkmoth male.<ref name=":10" /> In other species such as the [[codling moth]], on the other hand, the male tests the [[stereochemical purity]] of the attractant molecule. As soon as a small admixture of another stereoisomer is present in the pheromone cocktail, the approach to the source stops.<ref name=":10" /> In this case, the other stereoisomer acts as a [[Repellent-1|repellent]].<ref name=":5" /> In addition to the main components, some species release so-called short-range components in small amounts, which influence the behavioral response.<ref name=":10" /> In addition to the main components, some species release so-called short-range components in small amounts.

[[Foraging|Fouraging]] honey bees spread the scent of (''Z'')-11-eicosen-1-ol. [[European beewolf|European bee wolves]] are guided by this scent to prey on honey bees. Male bee wolves use this component, and thus the existing sensory preference of females for bee scent, as part of their sex pheromone cocktail to attract them.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Herzner |first1=Gudrun |last2=Schmitt |first2=Thomas |last3=Linsenmair |first3=K.

[[Aphrodisiac]] pheromones stimulate the readiness to mate. The [[Acetal|spiroacetal]] [[Olean (pheromone)|olean]], for example, is the aphrodisiac pheromone of the [[olive fruit fly]] (''Bactrocera oleae''). Only the (''R'') [[enantiomer]] is effective on males; the (S) enantiomer is ineffective on them. The female produces the [[Racemic mixture|racemate]], responds to (''R'')- and (''S'')-olean, and also stimulates herself with it.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Schäfer |first=Bernd |title=Naturstoffe in der chemischen Industrie |publisher=Spektrum Akademischer |year=2007 |isbn=978-3-8274-1614-8 |pages=522–524}}</ref>

So-called anti-aphrodisiacs have exactly the opposite effect. [[Bed bug|Bedbug]] [[nymph]]s protect themselves with such a pheromone, which has a specific mixing ratio of the aldehydes [[Cis-3-Hexenal|(''E'')-2-hexenal]], [[Octanal|(''E'')-2-octenal]] and [[4-oxo-(E)-2-hexenal|4-oxo-(''E'')-2-hexenal]], against mating attempts by male bedbugs. The latter directly drills a hole into the abdomen of sexually mature female bedbugs and injects its sperm there ([[traumatic insemination]]). For mated nymphs, however, such injury can be fatal.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Harraca |first1=Vincent |last2=Ryne |first2=Camilla |last3=Ignell |first3=Rickard |year=2010 |title=Nymphs of the common bed bug (Cimex lectularius) produce anti-aphrodisiac defence against conspecific males |journal=BMC Biology |volume=8 |page=121 |doi=10.1186/1741-7007-8-121|pmid=20828381 |pmc=2944131 |doi-access=free }}</ref>

==== Alarm pheromones ====
Some insect species emit alarm pheromones when attacked. These trigger either flight or increased aggression. In bees, for example, two alarm pheromone mixtures are known. One is released by the Koshevnikov gland near the sting and contains more than 40 different compounds, such as [[isoamyl acetate]], already described by Butler in its effect, besides [[butyl acetate]], [[1-Hexanol]], [[1-Butanol]], [[1-Octanol]], [[hexyl acetate]], [[octyl acetate]] and [[2-Nonanol]]. These components have low [[molar mass]], are volatile, and are the most non-specific of all pheromones. Alarm pheromones are released when a bee stings another animal to attract and entice other bees to attack. [[Smoke]] suppresses the effect of alarm pheromones, which is exploited by beekeepers.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Visscher |first1=P. Kirk |last2=Vetter |first2=Richard S. |last3=Robinson |first3=Gene E. |year=1995 |title=Alarm pheromone perception in honey bees is decreased by smoke (Hymenoptera: Apidae) |journal=Journal of Insect Behavior |volume=8 |pages=11–18 |doi=10.1007/BF01990966|s2cid=45575468 }}</ref>

The other alarm pheromone of the honey bee contains mainly [[2-Heptanone]], another volatile substance released by the mandibular glands.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Shearer |first1=D.

==== Marking and dispersion pheromones ====
Certain insects, such as the [[Rhagoletis cerasi|cherry fruit fly]], mark their oviposition sites in such a way that other females of the same species avoid the site and lay their eggs elsewhere to avoid competition for food among the offspring.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Boller |first1=E.

The marking pheromones include the dispersion pheromones, with which, for example, bark beetles prevent overcolonization of a tree.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Koleva |first=Petia |year=2012 |title=Untersuchungen zur Effizienz von insektizidbehandelten Fanghölzern gegen den Buchdrucker Ips typographus (Coleoptera, Curculionidae) |journal=Forstschutz Aktuell |volume=54 |pages=16–21}}</ref> The females and nymphs of the German cockroach transmit dispersion pheromones in direct contact via their saliva.

==== Trace pheromones ====
[[File:Fire ants02.jpg|thumb|[[Fire ant]]s use track pheromones to mark the path from the colony to feeding sites.]]
Trace pheromones are mainly known in insects living in [[Colony (biology)|colonies]], which mark their paths with low-volatile substances such as higher molecular weight [[hydrocarbon]]s. Ants in particular often mark the path from a food source to the nest in this way.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Breed |first1=M.

These run in large circles until complete exhaustion or death, without finding their way back to the colony.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Franks |first1=N.

==== Recruitment pheromones ====
Recruitment pheromones are widely used as an element of chemical communication in social insects and have been demonstrated for bees, [[termite]]s, and ants. These pheromones are used by insects to stimulate other members of the colony to forage at a food source.<ref name=":13" /> [[Bumblebee]]s perform a dance similar to the [[waggle dance]] primarily to distribute recruitment pheromones.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Mena Granero |first1=Angeles |last2=Guerra Sanz |first2=Jose M. |last3=Egea Gonzalez |first3=Francisco J. |last4=Martinez Vidal |first4=Jose L. |last5=Dornhaus |first5=Anna |last6=Ghani |first6=Junaid |last7=Roldan Serrano |first7=Ana |last8=Chittka |first8=Lars |year=2005 |title=Chemical compounds of the foraging recruitment pheromone in bumblebees |journal=Naturwissenschaften |volume=92 |issue=8 |pages=371–374 |doi=10.1007/s00114-005-0002-0|pmid=16049691 |bibcode=2005NW.....92..371G |s2cid=24317856 |url=http://qmro.qmul.ac.uk/xmlui/handle/123456789/839 }}</ref>

=== Primerpheromones ===
The order [[Hymenoptera]] contains the largest group of eusocial insects, including many [[bee]]s, especially of the subfamily [[Apinae]], ants, and some species of [[vespidae]], especially of the subfamily of [[Vespidae]]s. Characteristics often include the presence of a reproductive queen and [[Caste (biology)|castes]] with specialized [[Worker bee|workers bees]] and soldiers. Termites form the second major group of eusocial insects. Colonies are divided into distinct castes, with a queen and king as reproductive individuals, workers, and soldiers defending the colony.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Costa-Leonardo |first1=Ana-Maria |last2=Haifig |first2=Ives |title=Biocommunication of Animals |chapter=Termite Communication During Different Behavioral Activities |year=2014  |location=Springer Netherlands |pages=161–190|doi=10.1007/978-94-007-7414-8_10 |isbn=978-94-007-7413-1 }}</ref> Primer pheromones have a major influence on the organization of [[Hymenoptera|hymenopteran states]] formed by Hymenoptera and of termite colonies. These pheromones influence the hormonal system of the recipient; they often interfere with [[metabolism]] via a [[Biochemical cascade|signaling cascade]] or activate proteins that can bind to [[DNA]]. In contrast to the releaser pheromones, the primer pheromones are less well studied. For a long time, only one primer pheromone, 9-ODA, was known.

==== Primer pheromones of bees ====
A well-known example of primer pheromones are the queen bee pheromones.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Hoover |first1=Shelley E.

The components are [[carboxylic acid]]s and [[aromatic compound]]s. (''E'')-9-oxo-dec-2-enoic acid (9-ODA), for example, suppresses further breeding of queens and inhibits development of ovaries of worker bees. It is also a potent sex pheromone for [[Drone (bee)|drones]] on [[nuptial flight]].<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Wanner |first1=K. W. |last2=Nichols |first2=A. S. |last3=Walden |first3=K. K.

Brood recognition pheromones are emitted by larvae and [[pupa]]e and discourage worker bees from leaving the hive while there are still offspring to be cared for. Furthermore, they suppress the formation of ovaries in worker bees. The pheromones consist of a mixture of ten [[fatty acid ester]]s, including [[glyceryl 1,2-dioleate-3-palmitate]].<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Koeniger |first1=N. |last2=Veith |first2=H. J. |year=1984 |title=Spezifität eines Brutpheromons und Bruterkennung bei der Honigbiene (Apis Mellifera L.) |journal=Apidologie |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=205–210 |doi=10.1051/apido:19840208}}</ref> Worker pupae contain 2 to 5, drone pupae about 10 and queen pupae 30 [[microgram]]s of the pheromone.

Older, fouraging worker bees release [[Ethyl oleate|oleic acid ethyl ester]], which inhibits the development of nurse bees and makes them care for brood longer.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Leoncini |first1=I. |last2=Le Conte |first2=Y. |last3=Costagliola |first3=G. |last4=Plettner |first4=E. |last5=Toth |first5=A.

This delays their development until the number of older foragers decreases and with it the [[Exposure (epidemiology)|exposure]] of nurse bees to ethyl oleate.

==== Caste determinant pheromones ====
The ''Reticulitermes flavipes'' uses [[terpene]]s such as [[Cadinenes|γ-cadinene]] and γ-cadinenal as caste-stimulating or -inhibiting primerpheromones. These assist the juvenile hormone in determining the position of [[Cell potency|totipotent]] workers in the caste system.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Tarver |first1=Matthew R. |last2=Schmelz |first2=Eric A. |last3=Scharf |first3=Michael E. |year=2011 |title=Soldier caste influences on candidate primer pheromone levels and juvenile hormone-dependent caste differentiation in workers of the termite Reticulitermes flavipes |journal=Journal of Insect Physiology |volume=57 |issue=6 |pages=771–777 |doi=10.1016/j.jinsphys.2011.02.015|pmid=21356212 }}</ref> In ants, female larvae possess [[bipotentiality]] for some time and thus the possibility of developing as either queens or workers. At some point in larval development, continued feeding determines the fate of the larva. If the juvenile hormone titer is raised above a certain threshold, [[gynomorph]]s develop; otherwise, workers develop. Control of larval feeding is governed by a primerpheromone of the queen ant.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Vargo |first=Edward |year=1998 |title=Primer pheromones in ants |journal=Pheromone Communication in Social Insects: Ants, Wasps, Bees, and Termites |pages=293–313}}</ref>

== Application ==
In the 19th century, ''[[Lymantria dispar]]'' escaped from entomologist [[Étienne Léopold Trouvelot]] in [[Massachusetts]] and spread throughout the United States by the mid-20th century, becoming one of the most feared [[Pest (organism)|pests]] today. As early as 1898, Edward Forbush and Charles Fernald made attempts to control the population of the gypsy moth by luring males into traps set with attractant females.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Forbush |first1=Edward Howe |title=Gypsy moth.

[[File:Lockstofffalle.jpg|thumb|[[Insect trap]] for [[bark beetle]]s]]
In pest control, the use of pheromones in [[attractant]] traps to control insects is common practice. This can involve attracting the insects to kill them with an [[insecticide]] or physically to trap them or for [[Monitoring (medicine)|monitoring]]. [[Bark beetle]]s are attracted with aggregation pheromones to trap them. The attractant is usually released when drilling into spruce wood, signaling that the tree can be colonized. The bark beetle trap is an important tool for controlling bark beetles.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Klimetzek |first1=D. |last2=Schlenstedt |first2=L. |year=1991 |title=Waldschutz gegen Borkenkäfer: Der Beitrag von Duftstoffmeteorologie und Populationsdynamik |journal=Anzeiger für Schädlingskunde Pflanzenschutz Umweltschutz |volume=64 |issue=7 |pages=121–128 |doi=10.1007/BF01906002|s2cid=21132323 }}</ref> However, the use of attractant traps poses the problem that the pheromone may act as a [[kairomone]] and thus attract predatory insects. By reducing the population of natural predators of the bark beetle, the pheromone trap has a counterproductive effect in this case.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Wigger |first=H. |year=1993 |title=Ökologische Bewertung von Räuber-Beifängen in Borkenkäfer-Lockstoffallen |journal=Anzeiger für Schädlingskunde Pflanzenschutz Umweltschutz |volume=66 |issue=4 |pages=68–72 |doi=10.1007/BF01903073}}</ref> Monitoring by means of attractant traps, such as [[window traps]], is used for the quantitative detection of pests to control them more specifically with insecticides depending on the activity detected. In addition, they are used in the identification of new species.<ref>Pühringer, Franz; Ryrholm, Nils (2000-12-31). "Pheromonanflug europäischer Glasflügler (Lepidoptera, Sesiidae)".

[[Trap beetles]] work on the same principle as attractant traps. The bark beetles of the initial infestation attract further conspecifics by aggregation pheromones. Windthrow is suitable as trap beetles, which can be equipped with [[pheromone dispensers]] to enhance the attraction effect. Trees prepared in this way divert approaching bark beetles from the stand and bind them to controllable stems. The use of trap trees requires regular inspection of the trees. When larval galleries appear, the trees are debarked and larvae and pupae dry out. If necessary, the infested tree may be treated with insecticides or burned to prevent escape of the next generation.<ref>''[https://web.archive.org/web/20140714193658/http://www.waldverband.at/downloads/cms_uploaded/borkenkaefer.pdf Borkenkäfer – Vorbeugung und Bekämpfung].''

Egg-laying-preventing marking pheromones are widely used in the insect world.

Another application is the confusion method or mating disruption. Here, a high substance concentration of artificially produced pheromones is applied. This makes it impossible for the males to follow the pheromones of the females, thus hindering the reproduction of the pest. The confusion method has a species-specific effect.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Welter |first1=Stephen C. |last2=Pickel |first2=Carolyn |last3=Millar |first3=Jocelyn |last4=Cave |first4=Frances |last5=Van Steenwyk |first5=Robert A. |last6=Dunley |first6=John |year=2005 |title=Pheromone mating disruption offers selective management options for key pests |journal=California Agriculture |volume=59 |pages=16–22 |doi=10.3733/ca.v059n01p16|s2cid=51802541 }}</ref> It is usually successful with respect to one species if sufficient dispensers are applied, but in some cases related species occupy the [[ecological niche]] that is released.

Bees use the [[Nasonov pheromone|Nasanov pheromone]] to guide worker bees back to the hive. The pheromone contains terpenes such as [[geraniol]] and [[citral]]. Beekeepers use a man-made product to attract bees to an unused hive.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Danka |first1=R. G. |last2=Williams |first2=J. L. |last3=Rinderer |first3=T.

== Toxicology ==
Toxicological studies were mainly carried out in connection with the approval of pheromone traps and dispensers. A health hazard cannot be generally assessed due to the large chemical diversity of pheromones, but is usually excluded because only small amounts are emitted. However, in higher doses, orally administered pheromones such as [[cantharidin]] cause death in rare cases.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Polettini |first1=A. |last2=Crippa |first2=O. |last3=Ravagli |first3=A. |last4=Saragoni |first4=A. |year=1992 |title=A fatal case of poisoning with cantharidin |journal=Forensic Science International |volume=56 |issue=1 |pages=37–43 |doi=10.1016/0379-0738(92)90144-L|pmid=1398375 }}</ref>

Commercial application in crop protection intensified the study of pheromones and led to the development of highly sensitive [[Analytical technique|analytical methods]].<ref name="Athula B. Attygalle 1988" /> The identification of a pheromone proceeds through several steps. First, an extract of the pheromone is obtained. This is done by the method already used by Butenandt of extracting glands or whole animals with an easily evaporated [[solvent]], ideally at the time of high pheromone production.

The electroantennogram technique is suitable for studying the [[biological activity]] of insect pheromones.<ref name=":9" /><ref>{{Cite journal |last=Schneider |first=Dietrich |year=1957 |title=Elektrophysiologische Untersuchungen von Chemo- und Mechanorezeptoren der Antenne des Seidenspinners Bombyx mori L |journal=Zeitschrift für Vergleichende Physiologie |volume=40 |pages=8–41 |doi=10.1007/BF00298148|s2cid=6168639 }}</ref> In this technique, an [[electrode]] inserted into the antenna main stem and an antenna branch measures the change in [[Voltage|electrical voltage]] as a function of the [[concentration]] of pheromone molecules impinging on the antenna, which are transported to the antenna in a defined manner by an air current. [58] By varying the pheromone molecule, the influence of certain [[functional group]]s interacting with the [[Chirality|chiral]] elements of the receptors can be determined.<ref name=":9" />

The coupling of [[gas chromatography]] and electroantennogram allows the biological activity of the compounds present in an extract to be verified.<ref name=":9" /> The shape of the electroantennogram depends on the fragrance component in the air stream, and the amplitude increases with the concentration and flow velocity of the air.<ref>Dietrich Schneider: ''Insect pheromone research: some history and 45 years of personal recollections''.
