Reflections on the meaning and importance of one-letter words, however, return to a debate on which [[Plato]] took a stance in the ''[[Cratylus]]'', and which Gérard Genette summarizes as follows:

{{Block quote|text="Placed between two opponents, one of whom (Hermogenes) holds to the so-called conventionalist thesis [...] according to which names simply result from an agreement and convention [...] between men, and the other (Cratylus) to the so-called naturalistic thesis [...] according to which each object has received a "right name" that belongs to it according to a natural propriety, Socrates seems first to support the second against the first, then the first against the second"<ref>{{harvsp|Genette|1976|p=11}}.</ref>.}}

While contemporary linguists most often agree with [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] that "the [[Sign (semiotics)|linguistic sign]] is arbitrary" and that this principle "is not contested by anyone,"<ref><sup>(fr)</sup> Ferdinand de Saussure, ''Cours de linguistique générale'', Payot, 1995 ([https://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Cours_de_linguistique_g%C3%A9n%C3%A9rale/Texte_entier read online]), p. 100.</ref> this has not always been the case. The cratylic impulse has long haunted theories of language, leading to the attribution of mimetic meaning to letters in general, and to single-letter words in particular.

As Genette points out, this supposed [[mimesis]] is not only phonic, but sometimes graphic too:

{{Block quote|text="Writing can be conceived, as well as speech, as an imitation of the objects it designates [...] A so-called phonetic script, such as ours, can also be conceived as an imitation of the sounds it notes, each letter (for example) being the visual analogon of a phoneme [... ] Mimology in general can be divided into ''mimophony'' (the terrain of classical cratylism) and ''mimography'', which in turn is subdivided into ''ideomimography'' and ''phonomimography''. These two varieties of mimography are theoretically quite heterogeneous, and independent of each other. In practice, however, they may come together.<ref>{{harvsp|Genette|1976|p=77}}.</ref>}}{{multiple image

It should come as no surprise, for Gébelin:

{{Block quote|text="that the word ''A'' is at the head of the words: placed at the highest degree of the vowel scale, it dominates among them like a monarch among his subjects. Being the most sonorous, it is the first to be distinguished in the most sensitive manner: & it is from these physical qualities which are proper to it & which characterize it that we shall see all the meanings with which it has been clothed born."<ref>{{cite book|author=[[Antoine Court de Gébelin]]|date=1773|page=22|title=Monde primitif analysé et comparé avec le monde moderne considéré dans son génie allégorique et dans les allégories auxquelles conduisit ce génie|url=https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k108891b/f28}}<!-- auto-translated by Module:CS1 translator -->.</ref>.}}

According to Gébelin, all writing is "hieroglyphic," i.e. "made up of pure picto-ideograms." Consequently, "alphabetic writing is hieroglyphic [...], each letter being the painting of an object".<ref>{{cite book|author=[[Antoine Court de Gébelin]]|date=1773|page=402|title=Monde primitif|url=https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b8614577b/f442}}<!-- auto-translated by Module:CS1 translator -->.</ref> However, Genette notes that this does not imply the alphabet directly represents sounds.

{{Block quote|text="The letter-ideogram paints an object to the eyes; the phoneme, which for [Gébelin] is a true ideophone, paints that same object to the ears - and the resemblance between these two portraits results only from their equal fidelity to their common model."<ref>{{harvsp|Genette|1976|p=160}}.</ref>.}}

The [[incipit]] of Craig Conley's dictionary is the reminder of the White Queen's words to [[Through the Looking-Glass|Alice]]:

This evocation of [[Lewis Carroll]]'s text is all the more appropriate to the challenge of a dictionary of the words of a letter, since the description of the meaning of these words must include meanings that are not only nominative, i.e. relative to the use of language in general, but also stipulative, i.e. decided by an author in a particular context,<ref>{{cite book|author=Robert D.

{{Block quote|text="When I use a word," replied Humpty-Dumpty in a somewhat disdainful tone of voice, "it means exactly what I like it to mean... no more and no less."

[[Georges Perec]] underlines the special status of ''X'': "this letter that has become a word, this noun that is unique in the language in having only one letter, unique also in that it is the only one to have the shape of what it designates.{{refn|Véronique Montémont observes that the title ∈ "has no stable phonic equivalent" and can be read in several ways: ''Ensembles'', ''Appartient à'', ''Eu'', ''Signe d'appartenance''. Jacques Roubaud, who himself calls this work ''Euh'', is particularly pleased about this: "In principle, my title is unpronounceable [...] [J'en] tire une satisfaction puérile qui n'arrange pas ma réputation". Véronique Montémont nevertheless emphasizes the symbolic significance of this choice, "which places the work [...] under the double seal of literature [...] and mathematics".|group=nb}}

A character in [[James Joyce]]'s [[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]] speaks of books yet to be written:
{{Block quote|text="You were bowing to the mirror, stepping forward, taking the applause, serious as a pope, very striking face. Hurray for the Sunday moron! Rra! No one would notice: you didn't tell anyone. The books you were going to write with letters as titles. Did you read his ''F?'' Oh yes, but I prefer ''Q''. Of course, but ''W'' is magnificent. Ah yes, ''W''."}}

Unbeknownst to Joyce, ''F'' would be written by [[Daniel Kehlmann]] in 2013, ''[[Q (novel)|Q]]'' by [[Luther Blissett]] in 1999, and [[Georges Perec]]'s ''[[W, or the Memory of Childhood|W]]'', published in 1975, would describe a country "where sport and life merge in the same magnificent effort."

Other literary works with one-letter titles include: ''A'' by [[Louis Zukofsky]], ''G'' by [[John Berger]], ''H'' by [[Philippe Sollers]], ''R'' by [[Céline Minard]], ''S'' by [[John Updike]], ''[[V.]]'' by [[Thomas Pynchon]] and ''Z'' by [[Vassilis Vassilikos|Vassílis Vassilikós]]. [[Jacques Roubaud]] also titled one of his books ''∈'', this [[Glossary of mathematical symbols|mathematical symbol]] of belonging being for him "by extension, a symbol of belonging to the world."{{refn|According to Jack Goody, this characteristic of X is evidence of the "logographic" origin of the alphabet: "the sign we write X, and which we use to mean 'cross', refers, in addition to the sound we associate with it, to a concept, an object and an action".|group=nb}}<ref>{{cite book|author-link1=Jacques Roubaud|first1=Jacques|last1=Roubaud|page=11|publisher=Gallimard|title=∈}}<!-- auto-translated by Module:CS1 translator -->.</ref>

Several films also have a single-letter title, such as [[Alexandre Arcady]]'s ''K'', [[Oliver Stone]]'s ''[[W. (film)|W.]]'', [[Fritz Lang]]'s ''[[M (1931 film)|M]]'' and its ''[[M (1951 film)|remake]]'' by [[Joseph Losey]], or [[Costa-Gavras]]' ''[[Z (1969 film)|Z]]'', based on the novel of the same name.{{refn|One-letter words are also used to categorize films according to their intended audience. At the end of the 1930s, the British Board of Film Classification introduced a new category, "H" (''Horrific''), for horror films, alongside "U" (''Universal''), for all audiences, and "A" (''Adult''), for adults. The Motion Picture Association of America's film classification system, instituted in 1968, distinguishes between "X" and "pornographic" films, "G" (''General'') films for all audiences, including children, "M" (''Mature'') films for all audiences but with parental consent for children, and "R" (''Restricted'') films, forbidden to children under 17 if unaccompanied. In India, the Central Board of Film Certification distinguishes between "U" (''Unrestricted Public Exhibition'') films for all audiences, "A" (''Adults'') films for adults only, and "S" (''Special class of persons'') films for specialized audiences, such as doctors or engineers.|group=nb}}<ref>{{cite web|language=en|title=One Letter Movies|url=https://www.imdb.com/list/ls073947731/|website=[[Internet Movie Database|IMDb]]}}<!-- auto-translated by Module:CS1 translator -->.</ref>

He left it to 25 of his colleagues to put together the complete set of 26 poems based - from the Latin alphabet - on this principle."}}This short poem has been the subject of "formidable glosses"<ref><sup>(fr)</sup> Coraline Soulier, "L’Oulipo : temps contraint", in ''Poésie brève et temporalité'', Presses universitaires du Septentrion, 2017 ([https://books.google.fr/books?id=uuQpDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA131 read online] [[https://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbooks.google.fr%2Fbooks%3Fid%3DuuQpDwAAQBAJ%26pg%3DPA131 archive]]), p. 131.</ref> within the Oulipo.

In ''Écrits français'', [[Harry Mathews]] attempts a "textual explanation." He observes that "the only letter in the poem [...] is not a letter by itself, but a letter followed by a period. Punctuation transforms what would otherwise be a sufficient if mysterious entity into an ''abbreviation.''"<ref name=":1"><sup>(fr)</sup> Harry Mathews, "Écrits français", in ''La Bibliothèque oulipienne'', vol. 3, Seghers, 1990, p. 359-361.</ref> According to Harry Mathews, this is in fact a reduction of a device comparable to [[Raymond Queneau]]'s ''[[Hundred Thousand Billion Poems]].'' He designed, on the principle of perpetual motion, that the following sentence would be inscribed on the front and back of a page: "J'ai inventé le mouvement perpétuel T.S.V.P." (I invented perpetual motion T.S.V.P.). Bénabou then proceeded to make successive reductions, eventually inscribing only "T." on one side of a page.<ref name=":1" />

In 2006, [[Marcel Bénabou]] resumed his analysis of the poem in ''Miniature persane''. While praising Harry Mathews' "learned commentary" on the point, he considers that "there is nothing to prevent from thinking that it could be [...] a period" and that "in the author's mind, there is a hesitation as to the exact nature of his 'attempt' and of the 'work' to which said attempt has led". For Bénabou, the choice of the letter ''T'' is explained primarily by personal reasons, but also by the characteristics of this consonant, which is at once homophonic, polyphonic and polysemous. Bénabou observes, however, that Le Lionnais "doesn't seem to have taken any notice" of the "properly oral" dimension of the one-letter word, and in this connection evokes an "oulipien debate" for which [[Jacques Bens]] proposed '''''I''''', which should read "un en chiffre romain et en garamond gras" or "one in Roman numerals and in bold garamond," as it were.{{refn|Hervé Le Tellier notes a variant also attributed to Jacques Bens: a, which should read "petit a en romain et en garamond gras" and notes the proximity of the rebus.|group=nb}} Finally, Bénabou recalls an anecdote told by [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] in his ''[[Confessions (Rousseau)|Confessions]]'':
{{Block quote|text="I read that a wise bishop on a tour of his diocese found an old woman who for all her prayers knew only how to say ''O''. He said to her: Good mother, keep praying always like that; your prayer is better than ours".{{refn|The lesson cited by Marcel Bénabou is not universally accepted, with publishers and typographers hesitating over this letter. While "O" is the most common spelling, some editions give "Oh". The reference edition by Bernard Gagnebin and Marcel Raymond gives "Ô".|group=nb}}}}

He believes that the reader should also assure Le Lionnais that his poem is worth more than he thinks, as it "in no way leads to a dead end, but on the contrary to fantastic enrichment."

In 2007, [[Jacques Jouet]] finally responded to Le Lionnais' call, asking his Oulipo colleagues to "renew the gesture" by composing their own reduction.<ref name="JJ">{{harvsp|Oulipo|2007}}.</ref> Among the responses, [[François Caradec]] proposed reducing ''[[Un coup de dés jamais n'abolira le hasard (Mallarmé)|Un coup de dés jamais n'abolira le hasard]]'' to "D." [[Michelle Grangaud]], to reduce ''ruelle'' to "L." [[Paul Fournel]], "for strictly personal, emotional reasons," saw no other possibility than T." [[Olivier Salon]] reduced his poem to "P." [[Oskar Pastior]], after a quantitative analysis of [[Charles Baudelaire]]'s ''Harmonie du soir'', reduces it to "L." Anne F. Garréta proposed a prose narrative: "J." Harry Mathews, "K." both because this letter, like himself, "is only imperfectly integrated into the modern French language", and because it is "composed of three sticks," allowing it to be rearranged in order to construct twelve other letters.{{refn|Harry Mathews specifies: "with the three sticks, A, F, H, N, Z; with one or two, I, L, T, V, X, Y".|group=nb}}<ref name="JJ" />
