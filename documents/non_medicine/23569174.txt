'''''The Outer Limits''''' is a [[television series]] that originally aired on [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]], [[Syfy]], and in syndication between 1995 and 2002. The series is a [[List of old television series that were returned to after years|revival]] of the original ''[[The Outer Limits (1963 TV series)|The Outer Limits]]'' series that aired from 1963 to 1965.

''The Outer Limits'' is an [[anthology series|anthology]] of distinct story episodes, sometimes with a [[plot twist]] at the end. The revival series maintained an anthology format but occasionally featured recurring [[story arc]]s that were then tied together during season-finale [[clip show]]s.

==History==
After an attempt to bring back ''The Outer Limits'' during the early 1980s, it was finally relaunched in 1995. The success of television [[speculative fiction]] such as ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' and ''[[The X-Files]]'' and anthology shows such as ''[[Tales from the Crypt (TV series)|Tales from the Crypt]]'' convinced rights holder [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] to revive ''The Outer Limits''. A deal was made with Trilogy Productions, the company behind such cinema hits as ''[[Backdraft (film)|Backdraft]]'' and ''[[Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves]]''. The show would run on the pay-TV channel [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] (Trilogy, a Los Angeles and Canada-based company, is credited with creating the 1995 series).<ref name=trilogy1>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/MGM+Worldwide+Television+and+Trilogy+Entertainment+Group+enter...-a019111727 |title=MGM Worldwide Television and Trilogy Entertainment Group enter exclusive, multiyear television deal|date=1997-02-07}}</ref><ref name=trilogycanada>{{cite web|url=http://www.torontoscreenwritingconference.com/speakers |title=Speakers – Toronto Screenwriting Conference|year=2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118191525/http://www.torontoscreenwritingconference.com/speakers |archive-date=January 18, 2012 }}<!-- page gives 2016 speakers --></ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.linkedin.com/pub/pen-densham/9/9bb/393 |title=Pen Densham|access-date=July 16, 2015}}</ref>

The episodes appeared in syndication the following season (the same arrangement as MGM/Showtime series ''[[Stargate SG-1]]'' and ''[[Poltergeist: The Legacy]]''). It continued on Showtime until 2001, when [[Syfy|Sci-Fi]] quietly took over production for the seventh and final season. As a result, that season, unlike the previous ones, was completely free of any swearing or nudity. It was canceled in 2002, after a total of 152 episodes — far more than the original incarnation of the show.<ref name="GarciaPhillips2008">{{cite book|author1=Frank Garcia|author2=Mark Phillips|title=Science Fiction Television Series, 1990-2004: Histories, Casts and Credits for 58 Shows|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pQIDAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA169 |date=10 December 2008|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-9183-4|pages=169–}}</ref> In the revived show, the Control Voice was supplied by [[Kevin Conway (actor)|Kevin Conway]]. The new series distanced itself from the "[[Villain of the week|monster of the week]]" mandate that had characterized the original series from its inception; while there were plenty of aliens and monsters, they dramatized a specific scientific concept and its effect on humanity.<ref name="Westfahl2005">{{cite book|author=Gary Westfahl|title=The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Science Fiction and Fantasy: Themes, Works, and Wonders|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M_3kNDKhxIcC&pg=PA1193 |date=1 January 2005|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-32953-1|pages=1193–}}</ref> Examples of this include "[[Dark Rain (The Outer Limits)|Dark Rain]]" ([[biochemical warfare]] causing worldwide sterility), "[[Final Exam (The Outer Limits)|Final Exam]]" (discovery of practical [[cold fusion]] power), "[[A Stitch in Time (The Outer Limits)|A Stitch in Time]]" (a [[time travel]]er tinkers with history), as well as two episodes ("[[Unnatural Selection (The Outer Limits)|Unnatural Selection]]" and "Criminal Nature") revolving around a human mutation known as [[Genetic Rejection Syndrome]] (humans mutating into violent creatures) as a result of an outlawed [[eugenics]] attempt to create superior children.

==Production==
The series was filmed in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], and [[Victoria, British Columbia]]. Stories by [[Harlan Ellison]], [[A. E. van Vogt]], [[Eando Binder]], [[Richard Matheson]], [[Larry Niven]], [[Stephen King]], [[George R.R. Martin]] and [[James Patrick Kelly]] were adapted.

[[Leslie Stevens]] was a program consultant for the first four seasons (until his death), while [[Joseph Stefano]]—creator, producer, and head writer of the original ''Outer Limits'' TV series—served as an [[executive consultant]] and later senior advisor throughout the whole series. Stefano also remade his episode "[[A Feasibility Study]]", retitling it "[[Feasibility Study (The Outer Limits)|Feasibility Study]]" for the third season. [[John Van Tongeren]] and [[Mark Mancina]] composed new music different from that of [[Dominic Frontiere]] and [[Harry Lubin]]. John Van Tongeren scored ten episodes for the first season and continued through season 6. The musical theme for the modern ''Outer Limits'' series is credited to John Van Tongeren and Mark Mancina.

In most seasons, there was a [[clip show]] that intertwined the plots of several of the show's episodes (see "[[The Voice of Reason (The Outer Limits)|The Voice of Reason]]" for an example). At each [[television commercial|commercial]] interval, the Control Voice can be heard saying "The Outer Limits...please stand by".

A number of episodes from seasons 1–6 feature nudity and other adult content. Though originally broadcast uncensored, those episodes have been edited for commercial syndication.

Season 1 was released uncut and with extra features on DVD in the US (MGM, 2005), UK ([[20th Century Fox]], 2007), and Germany (Fox/MGM, 2008). Because sales of the set did not meet expectations, no further seasons were released.

In 2010, Canada's [[Alliance Films|Alliance Home Entertainment]] released all seven seasons on DVD. Season 1 mirrored the content of the earlier MGM set, while season 2 was also uncensored, with the exception of one episode, "[[Paradise (The Outer Limits)|Paradise]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/reviews/Outer-Limits-New-Season-2/9876 |title=Outer Limits, The (New) - Season 2 (CAN) Review|website=TVShowsOnDVD.com at the [[Wayback Machine]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160920164329/http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/reviews/Outer-Limits-New-Season-2/9876 |archive-date=2016-09-20}}</ref> Seasons 3–6 all contain numerous censored episodes, and Season 7 contains the original unedited episodes, as unlike the previous seasons, it was produced with no nudity or swearing.

In 2013, TGG Direct released the seventh season in the US, again unedited but of marginally inferior visual quality than the Alliance season 7 DVDs.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/review/R269P51XL6DDTG?ref_=glimp_1rv_cl |title=Customer Review|author=Buck Naked|publisher=Amazon.com|access-date=2016-11-03}}</ref> The 5-disc set is titled ''The Outer Limits: The Complete Final Season'', and, in 2014, it was split and re-released as a 3-disc ''Volume One'' and 2-disc ''Volume Two'' sets.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

Overall, "The Outer Limits" (1995 TV series) is considered a cult classic in the realm of science fiction and horror television, and it remains popular among fans of the genre. It might not have had the widespread mainstream success of some other sci-fi series, but it is remembered for its thought-provoking storytelling and its ability to push the boundaries of the genre.

==Tie-in books==
Between 1996 and 1997, [[Prima Publishing]] published three books which served as compilations of mostly prose adaptations for episodes from the 1963 and 1995 series.

Between 1997 and 1999, a series of books that were based on the show but aimed towards younger readers was published by [[Tor Books]], penned by [[genre fiction]] author [[John Peel (writer)|John Peel]]. The first, ''[[The Zanti Misfits]]'', was a loose adaptation of the eponymous 1963 series episode, while the second was based on the episode ''[[The Choice (The Outer Limits)|The Choice]]'' from the new series. The other ten books were original stories.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.innermind.com/outerlimits/info/olbooks.htm |title=Outer Limits Books|website=Innermind.com|access-date=11 December 2018}}</ref>
