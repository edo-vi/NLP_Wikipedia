'''''The Emperor's New Mind: Concerning Computers, Minds and The Laws of Physics''''' is a 1989 book by the mathematical physicist Sir [[Roger Penrose]].

Penrose argues that human [[consciousness]] is non-[[algorithm]]ic, and thus is not capable of being modeled by a conventional [[Turing machine]], which includes a [[digital computer]]. Penrose hypothesizes that [[quantum mechanics]] plays an essential role in the understanding of human [[consciousness]]. The [[Wave function collapse|collapse of the quantum wavefunction]] is seen as playing an important role in brain function.

Most of the book is spent reviewing, for the scientifically-minded lay-reader, a plethora of interrelated subjects such as [[Newtonian physics]], [[special relativity|special]] and [[general relativity]], the philosophy and limitations of mathematics, [[quantum physics]], [[physical cosmology|cosmology]], and the nature of [[time]]. Penrose intermittently describes how each of these bears on his developing theme: that consciousness is not "algorithmic". Only the later portions of the book address the thesis directly.

==Overview==
Penrose states that his ideas on the nature of consciousness are speculative, and his thesis is considered erroneous by experts in the fields of philosophy, computer science, and robotics.<ref>{{cite book | url = http://www.mth.kcl.ac.uk/~llandau/Homepage/Math/penrose.html | title = Penrose's Philosophical Error | last = Landau | first = L.

''The Emperor's New Mind'' attacks the claims of artificial intelligence using the physics of computing: Penrose notes that the present home of computing lies more in the tangible world of classical mechanics than in the imponderable realm of quantum mechanics. The modern computer is a deterministic system that for the most part simply executes algorithms. Penrose shows that, by reconfiguring the boundaries of a billiard table, one might make a computer in which the billiard balls act as message carriers and their interactions act as logical decisions. The [[billiard-ball computer]] was first designed some years ago by [[Edward Fredkin]] and [[Tommaso Toffoli]] of the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]].

==Reception==
Following the publication of the book, Penrose began to collaborate with [[Stuart Hameroff]] on a biological analog to quantum computation involving [[microtubules]], which became the foundation for his subsequent book, ''[[Shadows of the Mind|Shadows of the Mind: A Search for the Missing Science of Consciousness]]''.

Penrose won the [[The Aventis Prizes for Science Books|Science Book Prize]] in 1990 for ''The Emperor's New Mind''.<ref>[http://royalsociety.org/awards/science-books/ Royal Society Winton Prize for Science Books: Previous winners]. ''[[The Royal Society]]''. Retrieved 12 March 2013.</ref>

According to an article in the ''[[American Journal of Physics]]'', Penrose incorrectly claims a barrier far away from a localized particle can affect the particle.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Styer |first1=Daniel F. |title=Common misconceptions regarding quantum mechanics |journal=American Journal of Physics |date=1 January 1996 |volume=64 |issue=1 |pages=31–34 |doi=10.1119/1.18288}}</ref>
