{{Short description|Influence the environment on gene expression}}

'''Environmental epigenetics''' is a branch of [[epigenetics]] that studies the influence of external environmental factors on the [[gene expression]] of a developing [[embryo]].<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Rosenfeld CS |title=Animal models to study environmental epigenetics |journal=Biology of Reproduction |volume=82 |issue=3 |pages=473–488 |date=March 2010 |pmid=19828779 |doi=10.1095/biolreprod.109.080952 |s2cid=35334680 |doi-access=free}}</ref> The way that [[gene]]s are expressed may be passed down from parent to offspring through epigenetic modifications, although environmental influences do not alter the [[genome]] itself.

During embryonic development, epigenetic modifications determine which genes are expressed, which in turn determines the embryo's [[phenotype]]. When the offspring is still developing, genes can be turned on and off depending on exposure to certain environmental factors. While certain [[gene]]s being turned on or off can increase the risk of developmental diseases or abnormal phenotypes, there is also the possibility that the phenotype will be non-functional.<ref name="McCaw_2020" /> Environmental influence on epigenetics is highly variable, but certain environmental factors can greatly increase the risk of detrimental diseases being expressed at both early and adult life stages.<ref name=":0">{{cite journal|vauthors=Ho SM, Johnson A, Tarapore P, Janakiram V, Zhang X, Leung YK |title=Environmental epigenetics and its implication on disease risk and health outcomes |journal=ILAR Journal |volume=53 |issue=3–4 |pages=289–305 |year=2012 |pmid=23744968 |pmc=4021822 |doi=10.1093/ilar.53.3-4.289}}</ref>

== Environmental triggers for epigenetic change ==
The way that genes are expressed is influenced by the environment that the genome is in. These environmental influences are referred to as triggers and can involve anything that influences normal gene expression. How the genome is expressed depends on the environmental factors present during [[gestation]]. It is possible for the environmental effects of epigenetics to be deleterious or to be a natural part of the development pathway.<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal|vauthors=Simmons D |date=2008 |journal=Nature Education |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=6 |title=Epigenetic Influences and Disease {{!}} Learn Science at Scitable |url=http://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/epigenetic-influences-and-disease-895 |access-date=2023-04-07}}</ref> When these environmental factors are detrimental it causes the deactivation of some DNA sequences, which can lead to atypical phenotypes. Some of the most common triggers include diet, temperature, exposure to harmful substances, and lifestyle. These triggers can cause low birth weight, neurological disorders, cancers, autoimmune diseases, and many other malformations.

These epigenetic triggers can change the way that an [[organism]] develops and have lifelong effects. Epigenetic changes can be passed down through [[offspring]], present in multiple generations, and continue to change throughout a lifetime. Each sequence of affected DNA is not expressed at the same time. There are specific stages in which these expressions happen during development.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Feil R, Fraga MF |title=Epigenetics and the environment: emerging patterns and implications |journal=Nature Reviews. Genetics |volume=13 |issue=2 |pages=97–109 |date=January 2012 |pmid=22215131 |doi=10.1038/nrg3142 |s2cid=21879458}}</ref> The combined epigenetic mechanisms of DNA methylation and histone modification are responsible for how the genome is altered. For example, the suppression of [[Oncogene|oncogenes]] is regulated by DNA methylation and whether or not methylation is activated. This activation depends on the environment.<ref name=":1" /> When these activations happen, they can be passed down to the next generation through germ-cell differentiation.

=== Examples of triggers ===

==== Nutrients ====
Offspring can experience phenotypic changes depending on their access to nutrients. When nutrients are limited during pregnancy, the offspring's phenotypic expression can be disrupted. Nutrient intake is also important during [[lactation]] for the purpose of transferring nutrients to the offspring.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=LeBaron MJ, Rasoulpour RJ, Klapacz J, Ellis-Hutchings RG, Hollnagel HM, Gollapudi BB |title=Epigenetics and chemical safety assessment |journal=Mutation Research |volume=705 |issue=2 |pages=83–95 |date=October 2010 |pmid=20399890 |doi=10.1016/j.mrrev.2010.04.003}}</ref>

==== Exposures ====
Exposures to certain triggers such as alcohol or drugs can disrupt the normal expression of the offspring's phenotype. Antipsychotic drugs can lead to abnormal or stunted development during the [[Fetus|fetal]] or embryonic stages.<ref name="pmid22943166">{{cite journal|vauthors=Boyadjieva N, Varadinova M |title=Epigenetics of psychoactive drugs |journal=The Journal of Pharmacy and Pharmacology |volume=64 |issue=10 |pages=1349–58 |date=October 2012 |pmid=22943166 |doi=10.1111/j.2042-7158.2012.01475.x |s2cid=206003704 |doi-access=free}}</ref>

==== Stress during pregnancy ====
When the maternal figure is exposed to stressors it can lead to a greater likelihood of expressing or stunting DNA expression. If the maternal figure experiences high levels of [[Depression (mood)|depression]] or stress it can lead to small litter sizes with lower birth rates. Decreased [[hormone]] production is the suspected cause of this.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Barua S, Junaid MA |title=Lifestyle, pregnancy and epigenetic effects |journal=Epigenomics |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=85–102 |date=February 1, 2015 |pmid=25687469 |doi=10.2217/epi.14.71}}</ref>

==== Temperature ====
Changes in temperature can have varied effects on an organism. DNA methylation can be impacted by temperature when the temperature deviates from its normal value, preventing regular processes from taking place. Temperature can be considered a stressor in environmental epigenetics since it has the potential to change how offspring respond and react to their environment.<ref name="McCaw_2020">{{cite journal|vauthors=McCaw BA, Stevenson TJ, Lancaster LT |title=Epigenetic Responses to Temperature and Climate |journal=Integrative and Comparative Biology |volume=60 |issue=6 |pages=1469–1480 |date=December 2020 |pmid=32470117 |doi=10.1093/icb/icaa049 |hdl=2164/16571 |hdl-access=free}}</ref> [[Monarch butterfly|Monarch butterflies]] are an example of how temperature can impact the survival and [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] of an organism.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Hiyama A, Taira W, Otaki JM |title=Color-pattern evolution in response to environmental stress in butterflies |journal=Frontiers in Genetics |volume=3 |pages=15 |date=2012 |pmid=22363341 |pmc=3277265 |doi=10.3389/fgene.2012.00015 |doi-access=free}}</ref> If exposed to stressors such as varying temperatures, these butterflies may express coloring that deviates from their normal color. 

==== Lifestyle choices ====
[[Epigenetics|Epigenetic marks]] can result from a number of exposures and choices made by an individual in their lifetime. Exposure to environmental pollutants, psychological stress, dietary choices or restrictions, working habits, and consumption of drugs or alcohol all influence the epigenetics of an individual and what may be passed down to future offspring. <ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Kaushik P, Anderson JT |title=Obesity: epigenetic aspects |journal=Biomolecular Concepts |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=145–155 |date=June 2016 |pmid=27327133 |doi=10.1515/bmc-2016-0010 |s2cid=207442175 |doi-access=free}}</ref> Such exposures can affect important processes of epigenetics such as DNA methylation and histone acetylation, influencing the risk for noncommunicable diseases such as [[obesity]]. 

== Multigenerational epigenetic inheritance ==
Organisms respond to the habitat around them in many different ways, one way is by changing its gene expression to one that is most suitable for their surroundings. More often than not, this has a direct correlation to [[phenotypic plasticity]]. Phenotypic plasticity is when a species develops new physical features in response to the environment they’re in. Passing down epigenetics that are in relation to mitotic cell divisions allows for the belief of a possibility that this is also passed down from parents to offspring. Parents could be responsible for the development of new phenotypes in these cases.<ref name=":3">{{cite journal|vauthors=Ashe A, Colot V, Oldroyd BP |title=How does epigenetics influence the course of evolution? |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London. Series B, Biological Sciences |volume=376 |issue=1826 |pages=20200111 |date=June 2021 |pmid=33866814 |pmc=8059608 |doi=10.1098/rstb.2020.0111}}</ref>

=== Epigenetic inheritance ===
Epigenetic inheritance refers to passing down or transferring epigenetic information between the parent and offspring. Some believe that these occurrences can be passed down for many generations. For example, the language a given species utilizes develops a specific phenotype that will be passed down from generation to generation.<ref name=":3" />

=== Cultural inheritance ===
Cultural inheritance is a behavioral factor that is passed down from generation to generation, similar to inheritance. For example, in rats, mothers that lick and groom their pups pass down a specific behavior to their offspring causing them to do the same to the subsequent generation. Epigenetic inheritance is involved in this, but they are separate things that work together.<ref name=":3" />

== Mechanisms influencing epigenetics ==

=== DNA replication ===
[[File:0323 DNA Replication.jpg|thumb|DNA Replication]]

{{See also|DNA replication}}

[[DNA replication]] is a highly conserved process involving the copying of genetic information from parent one generation to the next. Within this complex process, [[chromatin]] disassembles and reassembles in a precise and regulated manner in order to compact large amounts of genetic material into the nucleus, while also maintaining the integrity of epigenetic information carried by [[Histone|histone proteins]] bound to [[DNA]] in the process of [[cell division]]. Half of the histones present during replication are from chromatin found in the parent DNA and thus carry the parent's epigenetic information.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Budhavarapu VN, Chavez M, Tyler JK |title=How is epigenetic information maintained through DNA replication? |journal=Epigenetics & Chromatin |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=32 |date=October 2013 |pmid=24225278 |pmc=3852060 |doi=10.1186/1756-8935-6-32 |doi-access=free }}</ref> These epigenetic marks play a critical role in determining chromatin structure and thus gene expression in the newly synthesized DNA. The other half of the histones present in replication are newly synthesized.

=== DNA methylation ===
{{see also|DNA methylation}}
[[File:Epigenetic mechanisms.jpg|thumb|Epigenetic mechanisms-DNA methylation and acetylation]]
A major formative mechanism of epigenetic modification is [[DNA methylation]]. DNA methylation is the process of adding a [[methyl group]] to a [[cytosine]] base in the [[DNA]] strand, via [[covalent bond]]. This process is carried out by specific [[enzyme]]s.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Miller RL, Ho SM |title=Environmental epigenetics and asthma: current concepts and call for studies |journal=American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine |volume=177 |issue=6 |pages=567–573 |date=March 2008 |pmid=18187692 |pmc=2267336 |doi=10.1164/rccm.200710-1511pp}}</ref> These methyl additions can be reversed in a process known as [[demethylation]]. The presence or absence of methyl groups can attract proteins involved in gene repression, or inhibit the binding of certain transcription factors, thus preventing methylated genes from being transcribed, ultimately affecting phenotypic expression.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Moore LD, Le T, Fan G |title=DNA methylation and its basic function |journal=Neuropsychopharmacology |volume=38 |issue=1 |pages=23–38 |date=January 2013 |pmid=22781841 |doi=10.1038/npp.2012.112 |pmc=3521964 |s2cid=9793643}}</ref>

=== Acetylation ===
{{see also|Acetylation}}

[[Acetylation]] is a reaction that introduces an [[acetyl group]] into an organic chemical compound, typically by substituting an acetyl group for a hydrogen atom. Deacetylation is the removal of an acetyl group from an organic chemical compound. [[Histone acetylation and deacetylation]] affect the three-dimensional structure of [[chromatin]]. A more relaxed chromatin structure leads to greater rates of genetic transcription, whereas a tighter structure inhibits transcription.

=== Transcriptional regulation ===
{{See also|Transcriptional regulation}}
[[File:Regulation of transcription in mammals.jpg|thumb|Regulation of transcription in mammals ]]
[[Transcriptional regulation]] is a complex process involving the binding of [[Transcription factor|transcriptional machinery]] to [[Regulation of gene expression|regulatory proteins]]—specifically chromatin remodeling or modifying proteins-directly onto a specific target. This may sometimes be facilitated by the contribution of [[Accessory gene regulator|accessory complexes]] that function primarily to repress and activate transcription in a cell. Transcriptional regulation additionally focuses on the epigenetic regulation of a target locus, as the epigenetic status of the locus determines either the facilitation of or prohibition of transcription. Epigenetic regulation is necessary for the precise deployment of transcriptional programs.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Patmanidi AL, Champeris Tsaniras S, Karamitros D, Kyrousi C, Lygerou Z, Taraviras S |title=Concise Review: Geminin-A Tale of Two Tails: DNA Replication and Transcriptional/Epigenetic Regulation in Stem Cells |journal=Stem Cells |volume=35 |issue=2 |pages=299–310 |date=February 2017 |pmid=27859962 |doi=10.1002/stem.2529 |s2cid=4487813 |doi-access=free}}</ref>
