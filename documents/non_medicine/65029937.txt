'''Fossil preparation''' is a complex of tasks that can include excavating, revealing, conserving, and replicating the ancient remains and traces of organisms. It is an integral part of the science of paleontology, of museum exhibition, and the preservation of fossils held in the public trust. It involves a wide variety of techniques, from the mechanical to the chemical, depending upon the qualities of the specimen being prepared and the goals of the effort. [[Fossil]] preparation may be executed by scientists, students or collections personnel, but is often undertaken by professional fossil preparators.<ref name="Wylie">{{cite journal |last1=Wylie |first1=Caitlin Donahue |title=Preparation in action: Paleontological skill and the role of the fossil preparator |date=2009 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265996428|journal=Fossil Preparation: Proceedings of the First Annual Fossil Preparation and Collections Symposium}}</ref>

==Techniques==
===Acid maceration===
Acid maceration is a technique to extract [[organic matter|organic]] [[microfossil]]s from a surrounding [[matrix (geology)|rock matrix]] using [[acid]]. [[Hydrochloric acid]] or [[acetic acid]] may be used to extract [[phosphatic]] [[fossil]]s, such as the [[small shelly fossil]]s, from a [[carbonate]] matrix. [[Hydrofluoric acid]] is also used in acid macerations to extract organic fossils from [[silicate]] rocks. Fossiliferous rock may be immersed directly into the acid, or a [[cellulose nitrate]] film may be applied ([[Dissolution (chemistry)|dissolved]] in [[amyl acetate]]), which adheres to the organic component and allows the rock to be dissolved around it.<ref name=Edwards1982>{{citation

===Film pull===
The film pull technique is a means of recovering carbonaceous compression fossils for study under transmitted light microscopy.  An acid is applied to the surface of the rock to etch away the matrix from the surface, leaving carbonaceous tissue protruding. (Surfaces not to be etched can be coated in a wax (e.g. Vaseline or grease).  This is usually accomplished by placing the rock upside-down in a weak, continually stirred acid, so that any debris can be washed away.  [[Nitrocellulose]] is then painted on to the fossil-bearing surface, and once dry may be peeled from the rock, or the rock dissolved in [[hydrofluoric acid]].<ref name="Hernick2008">{{Cite journal | last1 = Hernick | first1 = L. | last2 = Landing | first2 = E. | last3 = Bartowski | first3 = K. | title = Earth's oldest liverworts—Metzgeriothallus sharonae sp.

The method was pioneered by [[John Walton (botanist)|John Walton]], in collaboration with Reitze Gerben Koopmans,  in 1928 as a method to derive serial thin-sections without the time, expense and lost material incurred by dissolving the rock.<ref name="Walton1928">{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1038/122571a0 | last1 = Walton | first1 = J. | title = A Method of Preparing Sections of Fossil Plants contained in Coal Balls or in other Types of Petrifaction | journal = Nature | volume = 122 | issue = 3076 | pages = 571 | year = 1928 |bibcode = 1928Natur.122..571W | s2cid = 4102720 | doi-access = free }}</ref> An improvement on the method, using [[gelatine]] (with [[glycerin]] and [[formalin]]) instead of [[cellulose]], was reported in 1930, and is especially suitable for larger samples.<ref name="Walton1930">{{Cite journal | last1 = Walton | first1 = J. | title = Improvements in the Peel-Method of Preparing Sections of Fossil Plants | doi = 10.1038/125413b0 | journal = Nature | volume = 125 | issue = 3150 | pages = 413–414 | year = 1930 |bibcode = 1930Natur.125..413W | s2cid = 4083168 }}</ref> This solution-based method was largely superseded by the use of pre-formed sheets of film, similar to those used in overhead transparencies; [[cellulose nitrate]] and cellulose acetate can be used, although the latter is preferable.<ref>{{Cite journal

Even the latest technique does have some disadvantages; most notably, smaller fossils that may lie between cell walls will be washed away with the acid etch, and can only be recovered by a thin section preparation.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Taylor | first1 = T.

In order to mount the slides for microscopy, a series of steps are necessary:<ref name="Holmes1986" />
* A glass slide is wetted with [[acetone]], and a fresh layer of [[acetate]] is placed upon it.  The acetone allows the acetate to 'suck' itself onto the slide, maintaining a good contact by suction.  This will later be dissolved, allowing sections of the resin-mounted peel to be cut for transmission electron microscopy.
* A thin layer of epoxy resin is applied, covering the acetate and spreading onto the slide.  This will serve to attach the preparation to the slide once the underlying acetate has been dissolved.  
* A glass plate is greased, and the smooth side of a peel pressed down onto it.
* The rough side of this peel is covered with warmed (55&nbsp;°C) epoxy resin, and pressed down onto the previously-prepared slide.  After about 45 minutes the glass plate is removed, and the resin is left, warm, to cure.
* The preparation is washed in acetone and acid to remove any residues, which would otherwise produce optical artefacts when imaged.

Specimens recovered by film pull are prone to wrinkling, especially if the surface to be peeled is not perfectly smoothed—if acetone pools, it can cause the acetate to wrinkle.<ref name="bare_url" />

===Transfer technique===
[[File:Darwinius masillae PMO 214.214.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[holotype]] of ''[[Darwinius]]'', showing the result of transfer technique. The amber-colored matrix is two-component epoxy.]]
The transfer technique is a technique to stabilise and prepare [[fossils]] by partially embedding them in plastic resins (i.e. [[epoxy]] or [[polyester]]) in order to preserve the position of the preserved fossil once all of the rock matrix is subsequently removed. Notable examples of this technique are fossils preserved in [[oil shale]] (such as those from the [[Messel Pit]]) or other substrates that will deteriorate under atmospheric conditions, or fossils preserved in acid-soluble carbonates (such as fossils from the [[Santana Formation]]).<ref>Maisey, J. G., Rutzky, I., Blum, S. & W. Elvers (1991): Laboratory Preparation Techniques. In Maisey, j:G. (ed): ''Santana Fossils: An Illustrated Atlas'', Tfh Pubns Inc.{{ISBN|0866225498}}. pp 99–103.</ref> The technique is notable for delivering exquisite preparations of both very high scientific and display value, as the area exposed in this method is protected by the matrix prior to the preparation, while the initially exposed fossils are often subject to damage from improper mechanical removal of sediment or where the plane of splitting has extended through the fossil. This allows the potential to preserve microscopic details on the surface of the fossil.<ref name=Barling>{{cite journal|last=Barling|first=Nathan|author2=David M.

The method was pioneered by Harry Toombs and A. E. Rixon of the British Museum in 1950<ref>{{cite journal|last=Toombs|first=Harry|author2=A. E. Rixon |title=The use of plastics in the "transfer method" of preparing fossils|journal=The Museums Journal|year=1950|volume=50|pages=105–107|url=http://www.bcin.ca/Interface/openbcin.cgi?submit=submit&Chinkey=18013}}</ref>  with the introduction of the technique as a means of extracting fish fossils from acid-soluble carbonates. The technique permitted the preparation of delicate, fragmented, or otherwise unstable fossils by the removal of virtually all of the surrounding rock matrix. The resulting preparation retains the position of all of the parts of the fossil in the position in which they were preserved in the fossil. While the method developed by Toombs and Rixon calls for plastic resins, other substances, such as a mix of ground [[chalk]] and [[beeswax]] have been used.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Keller|first=T. |author2=Frey, E. |author3=Hell, R. |author4=Rietschel, S. |author5=Schaal, S. |author6=Schmitz, M. |title=Ein Regelwerk für paläontologische Grabungen in der Grube Messel|journal=Paläontologische Zeitschrift|year=1991|volume=65|issue=1–2|pages=221–224|doi=10.1007/BF02985786|s2cid=128399238 }}</ref>

[[File:Grube Messel Ölschiefer 2005-09-24.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Oil shale from Messel, cracking up as it dries.]]
While the original method was developed to deal with fossils freed from the matrix by acid, its most well known application is to the fossils from The [[Messel pit]]. These fossils, noted for their exquisite preservation, including soft tissue, body outline and even colour sheen on beetle wings, are notoriously difficult to preserve. The fossils themselves are flat, sometimes film-like on the surface of the rock layers. The oil shale contains 40% water. When a slab is broken free of surrounding rock, it will soon dry out and crack.<ref>Messel Oil Shale Fossil Site Lagerstatte, Virtual fossil museum [http://www.fossilmuseum.net/Fossil_Sites/Messel/Messel-Lagerstatt.htm website]</ref> 
A slab with a perfect fossil will turn to a heap of rubble in a few hours, destroying the fossil with it. This was the fate of numerous Messel fossils until the transfer technique was started to be applied in the 1970s.

In order to preserve the fossils once their slab is taken out of the rock, the fossil need to be transferred from the rock surface on to a durable, artificial surface. The water in the fossil itself also needs to be replaced.

As soon as the slab bearing the fossil is worked free from the rock, it is submerged in water to stop it from cracking. This involves packing it in plastic and sometimes wet newspaper. While in the wet state, it is cleaned up and all preparation needed for the transfer conducted.<ref>Messel Research Station, Senckenberg Forschungsinstitut und Naturmuseum [http://www.senckenberg.de/root/index.php?page_id=3322 website]</ref>

Once ready for transfer, the fossil (but not the surrounding rock) is dried off with a blow-dryer. As soon as the fossil starts to lighten (a sign of drying), water-soluble lacquer is applied. The lacquer will penetrate the bone and other organic remains, but not the shale itself, as shale is impenetrable to watery solutions.

When the lacquer has set, a frame of [[modelling clay]] is built on the rock face around the fossil. A two-component [[epoxy]] is poured onto the frame, forming the new artificial surface for the fossil. The composition of the resin is important, as it will have to soak into the fossil to further strengthen it and to bind it to the new surface. This can be controlled by varying the resin viscosity.<ref name=Barling />

When the epoxy has set, the slab is turned over, and preparation begins from the shale at the back. Layer by layer of oil-shale is removed with brush and scalpel. When the preparator hits the fossil, more lacquer and glue is applied to further stabilize the fragile fossil. When the work is done, all traces of oil-shale have been removed, only the fossil itself remains on the epoxy slab.<ref>Messel Fossils from Germany [http://www.indiana9fossils.com/MesselFossils/Messel.htm website]</ref>

The contrasting physical property of the rock and fossil are essential for this technique to succeed. The organic remains of the fossil are porous and hygroscopic, while the oil-containing rock is not. Thus, the lacquer can penetrate fossils, and not rock, enabling the preparator to “glue” the fossil to the artificial slab, without at the same time gluing it to the shale.
