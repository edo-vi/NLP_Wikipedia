The '''Guidelines International Network''' ('''GIN''') is an international scientific association of organisations and individuals interested and involved in development and application of  [[Evidence-based medicine|evidence-based]] [[medical guideline|guidelines]]<ref>Burgers JS, Grol R, Klazinga NS, Mäkelä M, Zaat J, for the AGREE Collaboration. Towards evidence-based clinical practice: an international survey of 18 clinical guideline programs. Int J Qual Health Care 2003;15:31-45</ref> and [[health care]] information. The network supports [[Evidence-based medicine|evidence-based]] health care and improved health outcomes by reducing inappropriate variation throughout the world.

== Membership and Organisation ==
The Network's membership consists of 115 organisations working in the field of [[medical guideline]]s and other types of healthcare guidance as well as of around 130 individual experts (March 2021). The members represent about 47 countries from all continents.
The list of members is available on the GIN website<ref>[https://g-i-n.net/organisation/ GIN List of members]</ref>
Being constituted as a Scottish Guarantee Company under Company Number SC243691, the Network is recognised as a [[Scottish Charity]] under Scottish Charity Number SC034047.

== History ==
Based upon the work of the international AGREE Collaboration for the quality of clinical practice guidelines,<ref>The AGREE Collaboration. Development and validation of an international appraisal instrument for assessing the quality of clinical practice guidelines: the AGREE project. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12571340 Qual Saf Health Care 2003;12:18-23.]</ref> an organised network for organisations and experts working in the field of evidence-based guidelines was proposed in early 2002 at the first international guideline conference in Berlin, Germany.<ref>Miller J, Ollenschläger G. [http://www.aezq.de/aezq/uber/azq_veranstaltungen/cpg/cpg2002-en Globalisation of CPGs: Do we need an international guidelines network? Presentation, International Guideline Symposium CPG2002]</ref> Guideline experts called for international standardized guideline methods, and information exchange in this field. The proposal was endorsed by health care agencies from all parts of the world such as [[AHRQ]] (USA), CBO (NL) [[German Agency for Quality in Medicine]], [[NICE]] (UK), SIGN (UK), and NZGG (NZ).
Against this background the Guidelines International Network GIN was founded in November 2002 in Paris with [[Günter Ollenschläger]] as founding chairman.<ref>[[Ollenschlaeger|G. Ollenschläger]], C. Marshall, S. Qureshi et al.: Improving the quality of health care: using international collaboration to inform guideline programmes by founding the Guidelines International Network (G-I-N). [http://qshc.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/13/6/455   Qual Saf Health Care 2004;13:455-460]</ref>

== Mission and Aims ==
The goal of the network is to lead, strengthen and support collaboration and work within the guideline development, adaptation and implementation community.
GIN's main aims are:
* Promoting best practice<ref>Council of Europe. [http://www.leitlinien.de/mdb/edocs/pdf/literatur/coe-rec-2001-13.pdf Developing a methodology for drawing up guidelines on best medical practice. Recommendation Rec(2001)13 and explanatory memorandum. Strasbourg: Council of Europe Publishing, 2002.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191202140857/https://www.leitlinien.de/mdb/edocs/pdf/literatur/coe-rec-2001-13.pdf |date=2 December 2019 }}</ref> through the development of learning opportunities and capacity building, as well as the establishment of standards
* Improving the efficiency and effectiveness of evidence-based guideline development, adaptation, dissemination and implementation
* Building a Network and partnerships for guideline developing organisations, end users (such as health care providers, healthcare policy makers and consumers) and stakeholders.
