'''''D-TV''''' is an old series of [[music video]]s created by [[The Walt Disney Company]] and produced by [[Charles Braverman]]<ref>[https://archive.org/details/WJZ-EVMAG-096-001 Evening Magazine: July 4 and 5, 1984 : WJZ-TV (Television Station: Baltimore, Md.) on Internet Archive]</ref> and edited by Ted Herrmann which premiered on May 5, 1984,<ref>[https://d23.com/a-to-z/dtv-television/ DTV (television) - D23]</ref> by taking hit songs of the past and putting them together with various footage of vintage [[Disney]] animation, created out of the trend of music videos on cable channel [[MTV]], which inspired the name of this series.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://insidethemagic.net/2019/02/dtv/|title=DTV – Disney's answer to Music Television|date=2019-02-13|website=Inside the Magic|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref>

== Content ==
Most songs used were contemporary hits (e.g., Hall and Oates' "Private Eyes"), though older songs like Sheb Wooley's '50s hit "The Purple People Eater" were also featured. The videos were shown as filler material on [[Disney Channel]] (as the network did not air commercials at this time), as well as being the focus of television specials. Home video collections were also released on VHS, Beta, CED Videodisc, and Laserdisc formats. After the first run of ''D-TV'', in 1989 a second series was produced known as ''DTV²''.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Lenburg |first1=Jeff |title=The Encyclopedia of Animated Cartoons |date=1999 |publisher=Checkmark Books |isbn=0-8160-3831-7 |access-date=6 June 2020 |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780816038312/page/254/mode/2up |page=254}}</ref>

== Theme music ==
The main title music, known as "RPM", was created in 1981 by a recording company called [[Network Music]].<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEi6baWBIoo RPM - Network Music Ensemble - Topic on YouTube]</ref> When the segments were shown individually on television, the title music used was from "Sunset Boulevard", also by Network Music.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AslpShWWhDw Sunset Boulevard - Network Music Ensemble - Topic on YouTube]</ref> In the opening of ''D-TV'', a cheese-like Moon zooms out to reveal a black background with blue musical notes. A silhouette of [[Mickey Mouse]]'s head rises from the Moon, and the Moon exits below the screen. The letter D (in the corporate Disney font) and the letters TV appear and zoom out to attach Mickey Mouse's head. Finally, after a few seconds, we zoom into Mickey Mouse's head and revealing several vintage Disney cartoon clips.

== Home media ==
Many of the songs listed above were released on VHS, in five separate volumes. The first three volumes "Pop & Rock", "Rock, Rhythm & Blues", and "Golden Oldies" were released in late 1984, as part of [[Walt Disney Home Video]]'s "Wrapped and Ready to Give" promotion. Following that, two more videos, "Love Songs" and "Groovin' For a '60s Afternoon", were released during the summer of 1985.

== Television specials ==
Disney aired three ''DTV'' television specials on [[NBC]] in 1986 and 1987: ''DTV Valentine'' (Feb 14, 1986, re-titled ''DTV Romancin''' in later airings), ''DTV Doggone Valentine'' (Feb 13, 1987), and ''DTV Monster Hits'' (Oct 30, 1987).
