A '''whiting event''' is a phenomenon that occurs when a suspended cloud of fine-grained [[calcium carbonate]] precipitates in [[Body of water|water bodies]], typically during summer months, as a result of [[Photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] microbiological activity or [[sediment]] disturbance.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1">{{Cite journal|last1=Larson|first1=Erik B.|last2=Mylroie|first2=John E.|date=2014|title=A review of whiting formation in the Bahamas and new models|journal=Carbonates and Evaporites|volume=29|issue=4|pages=337–347|doi=10.1007/s13146-014-0212-7|s2cid=128695792 |issn=0891-2556}}</ref><ref name=":4" /> The phenomenon gets its name from the white, chalky color it imbues to the water.

== Characteristics ==
Whiting event clouds consist of calcium carbonate [[Polymorphism (materials science)|polymorphs]]; [[aragonite]] tends to be the dominant precipitate, but some studies in [[Trophic state index|oligotrophic]] and [[Trophic state index|mesotrophic]] lakes show [[calcite]] is favored.<ref name=":4" /><ref name=":2">{{Cite journal|last1=Dittrich|first1=Maria|last2=Obst|first2=Martin|date=2004|title=Are Picoplankton Responsible for Calcite Precipitation in Lakes?|journal=Ambio: A Journal of the Human Environment|volume=33|issue=8|pages=559–564|doi=10.1579/0044-7447-33.8.559|pmid=15666689|s2cid=45359827 |issn=0044-7447}}</ref> Whiting events have been observed in tropical and temperate waters, and they can potentially cover hundreds of meters.<ref name=":4" /> They tend to occur more often in summer months, as warmer waters promote calcium carbonate precipitation, and in [[hard water]]s.<ref name=":4" /><ref name=":3">{{Cite journal|last1=Effler|first1=Steven W.|last2=Perkins|first2=Mary Gail|last3=Greer|first3=Harry|last4=Johnson|first4=David L.|date=1987|title=Effect of "whiting" on optical properties and turbidity in Owasco Lake, New York|journal=Journal of the American Water Resources Association|volume=23|issue=2|pages=189–196|doi=10.1111/j.1752-1688.1987.tb00796.x|bibcode=1987JAWRA..23..189E|issn=1093-474X}}</ref> Whitings are typically characterized by cloudy, white patches of water, but they can also be tanner in hue in very shallow waters (less than 5m deep).<ref name=":1" /> In some cases, the whiting might be cryptic (not visible at the surface), but still generate calcium carbonate.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Bialik |first1=Or M. |last2=Sisma-Ventura |first2=Guy |last3=Vogt-Vincent |first3=Noam |last4=Silverman |first4=Jacob |last5=Katz |first5=Timor |date=2022-09-24 |title=Role of oceanic abiotic carbonate precipitation in future atmospheric CO2 regulation |journal=Scientific Reports |language=en |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=15970 |doi=10.1038/s41598-022-20446-7 |pmid=36153366 |pmc=9509385 |issn=2045-2322}}</ref> These shallow water whiting events also tend to last less than a day in comparison to deeper water events that can last for several days up to several months.<ref name=":1" /> Regardless of the event's lifespan, the clouds it produces increase [[turbidity]] and hamper light penetration.<ref name=":3" />

== Potential causes ==
Some debate exists surrounding the exact cause of whiting events. And although much research exists on the subject, there is still no definitive consensus on the chemical mechanisms behind it. The three most common suggested causes for the phenomenon are: microbiological processes, re-suspension of marine or bottom sediments, and spontaneous direct precipitation from water.<ref name=":8">{{Cite journal|last1=Long|first1=Jacqueline S.|last2=Hu|first2=Chuanmin|last3=Wang|first3=Mengqiu|date=February 2018|title=Long-term spatiotemporal variability of southwest Florida whiting events from MODIS observations|journal=International Journal of Remote Sensing|volume=39|issue=3|pages=906–923|doi=10.1080/01431161.2017.1392637|bibcode=2018IJRS...39..906L|s2cid=134734239 |issn=0143-1161}}</ref><ref name=":4" /><ref name=":1" /> Of these three, the last has been ruled unlikely due to the unfavorable [[reaction kinetics]] of spontaneous calcium carbonate precipitation.<ref name=":1" /> It is also worth noting that it may be possible for more than one of the aforementioned factors to contribute to whiting events in the same region.<ref name=":8" />

=== Microbiological activity ===
Substantial findings indicate [[Photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] [[picoplankton]], pico[[cyanobacteria]], and [[phytoplankton]] activity creates favorable conditions for carbonate precipitation.<ref name=":4" /><ref name=":1" /><ref name=":2" /> This link arises as a result of [http://www.genomenewsnetwork.org/articles/02_02/bloom_art.shtml planktonic blooms] being observed coinciding with the events.<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":2" /> Subsequently, via photosynthesis, these organisms uptake [[Inorganic carbon compound|inorganic carbon]], raise water [[pH]], and alter water [[alkalinity]], which promotes calcium carbonate precipitation.<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":2" /> The thermodynamic influence of inorganic carbon on whiting calcium carbonate production is shown in the equation below. Furthermore, cases exist in which the type of calcium carbonate found in the whiting cloud matches the type found on local cyanobacteria membranes.<ref name=":5" /> It's hypothesized that the [[Extracellular polymeric substance|extracellular polymeric substances (EPS)]] these microorganisms produce can act as [[seed crystal]]s that provide a start for the precipitation process.<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":2" /> Current research on the specifics of these EPS and the exact physiological mechanisms of the microorganisms' carbon uptake, however, are limited.<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":2" />

=== Sediment re-suspension ===
In shallower waters, evidence supports that activity of local fisherman and marine life such as fish and certain shark species can disturb bottom sediments containing calcium carbonate particles and lead to their suspension.<ref name=":1" /> In addition, as microorganisms impact water chemistry in observable ways and require certain nutrient levels to thrive, whiting events found occurring in nutrient-poor waters where no significant alkalinity difference exists between whiting and non-whiting waters support the idea of sediment re-suspension as a primary cause.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Morse|first1=John W.|last2=Gledhill|first2=Dwight K.|last3=Millero|first3=Frank J.|date=2003|title=Caco3 precipitation kinetics in waters from the great Bahama bank|journal=Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|volume=67|issue=15|pages=2819–2826|doi=10.1016/S0016-7037(03)00103-0}}</ref>   

== Relevance ==
Whiting events have a unique effect on the waters around them. The fact that calcium carbonate clouds increase turbidity and light reflectance holds implications for organisms and processes that depend on light.<ref name=":5" /> In addition, whiting events can function as a transport mechanism for [[Carbon compounds|organic carbon]] to the [[benthic zone]], which is relevant to [[nutrient cycling]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Hodell|first1=David A.|last2=Schelske|first2=Claire L.|date=1998|title=Production, sedimentation, and isotopic composition of organic matter in Lake Ontario|journal=Limnology and Oceanography|volume=43|issue=2|pages=200–214|doi=10.4319/lo.1998.43.2.0200|bibcode=1998LimOc..43..200H|issn=0024-3590|doi-access=free}}</ref> The cyanobacteria abundant clouds also hold the potential to act as a means to study the microorganism's role in carbon cycling (especially in relation to climate change) and their possible role in finding petroleum [[source rock]]s.<ref name=":7">{{Cite book|title=AAPG Studies in Geology|last1=Yates|first1=K.K|last2=Robbins|first2=L.L.|publisher=American Association of Petroleum Geologists|year=2001|location=Tulsa, Ok|pages=267–283|chapter=Microbial Lime-Mud Production and Its Relation to Climate Change}}</ref><ref name=":6">{{Cite journal|last1=Shinn|first1=Eugene A.|last2=St.C.
