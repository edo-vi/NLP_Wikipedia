In the field of [[artificial intelligence]] (AI), '''AI alignment''' research aims to steer AI systems towards humans' intended goals, preferences, or ethical principles. An AI system is considered ''aligned'' if it advances the intended objectives. A ''misaligned'' AI system pursues some objectives, but not the intended ones.<ref name="aima4">{{Cite book |last1=Russell |first1=Stuart J. |url=https://www.pearson.com/us/higher-education/program/Russell-Artificial-Intelligence-A-Modern-Approach-4th-Edition/PGM1263338.html |title=Artificial intelligence: A modern approach |last2=Norvig |first2=Peter |publisher=Pearson |year=2020 |isbn=978-1-292-40113-3 |edition=4th |pages=31–34 |oclc=1303900751 |access-date=September 12, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220715195054/https://www.pearson.com/us/higher-education/program/Russell-Artificial-Intelligence-A-Modern-Approach-4th-Edition/PGM1263338.html |archive-date=July 15, 2022 |url-status=live}}</ref>

It can be challenging for AI designers to align an AI system because it can be difficult for them to specify the full range of desired and undesired behavior. To avoid this difficulty, they typically use simpler [[Misaligned goals in artificial intelligence#Undesired side-effects|''proxy goals'']], such as [[Reinforcement learning from human feedback|gaining human approval]]. But that approach can create loopholes, overlook necessary constraints, or reward the AI system for merely appearing aligned.<ref name="aima4" /><ref name="dlp2023">{{Cite arXiv |last1=Ngo |first1=Richard |last2=Chan |first2=Lawrence |last3=Mindermann |first3=Sören |date=2023-02-22 |title=The alignment problem from a deep learning perspective |class=cs.AI |eprint=2209.00626 }}</ref>

Misaligned AI systems can malfunction or cause harm. AI systems may find loopholes that allow them to accomplish their proxy goals efficiently but in unintended, sometimes harmful ways ([[Misaligned goals in artificial intelligence#Specification gaming|reward hacking]]).<ref name="aima4" /><ref name="mmmm2022"/><ref>{{Cite conference |last1=Zhuang |first1=Simon |last2=Hadfield-Menell |first2=Dylan |year=2020 |title=Consequences of Misaligned AI |url=https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2020/hash/b607ba543ad05417b8507ee86c54fcb7-Abstract.html |publisher=Curran Associates, Inc. |volume=33 |pages=15763–15773 |book-title=Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems |accessdate=2023-03-11}}</ref> They may also develop unwanted [[Instrumental convergence|instrumental strategies]], such as seeking power or survival, because such strategies help them achieve their given goals.<ref name="aima4" /><ref name=Carlsmith2022>{{cite arXiv |eprint=2206.13353 |class=cs.CY |first=Joseph |last=Carlsmith |title=Is Power-Seeking AI an Existential Risk? |date=2022-06-16}}</ref><ref name=":2102"/> Furthermore, they may develop undesirable emergent goals that may be hard to detect before the system is deployed, when it faces new situations and [[Domain adaptation|data distributions]].<ref name=Christian2020>{{Cite book |last=Christian |first=Brian |url=https://wwnorton.co.uk/books/9780393635829-the-alignment-problem |title=The alignment problem: Machine learning and human values |publisher=W.

But designers are often unable to completely specify all important values and constraints, and so they resort to easy-to-specify [[Misaligned goals in artificial intelligence#Undesired side-effects|''proxy goals'']] such as [[Reinforcement learning from human feedback|maximizing the approval]] of human overseers, who are fallible.{{r|concrete2016|building2018}}<ref name=Unsolved2022>{{Cite arXiv |last1=Hendrycks |first1=Dan |last2=Carlini |first2=Nicholas |last3=Schulman |first3=John |last4=Steinhardt |first4=Jacob |date=2022-06-16 |title=Unsolved Problems in ML Safety |class=cs.LG |eprint=2109.13916 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last1=Russell |first1=Stuart J. |url=https://www.pearson.com/us/higher-education/program/Russell-Artificial-Intelligence-A-Modern-Approach-4th-Edition/PGM1263338.html |title=Artificial intelligence: a modern approach |last2=Norvig |first2=Peter |date=2022 |publisher=Pearson |isbn=978-1-292-40113-3 |edition=4th |pages=4–5 |oclc=1303900751}}</ref><ref name=SpecGaming2020>{{Cite web |last1=Krakovna |first1=Victoria |last2=Uesato |first2=Jonathan |last3=Mikulik |first3=Vladimir |last4=Rahtz |first4=Matthew |last5=Everitt |first5=Tom |last6=Kumar |first6=Ramana |last7=Kenton |first7=Zac |last8=Leike |first8=Jan |last9=Legg |first9=Shane |date=2020-04-21 |title=Specification gaming: the flip side of AI ingenuity |url=https://www.deepmind.com/blog/specification-gaming-the-flip-side-of-ai-ingenuity |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230210114143/https://www.deepmind.com/blog/specification-gaming-the-flip-side-of-ai-ingenuity |archive-date=February 10, 2023 |accessdate=2022-08-26 |work=Deepmind}}</ref> As a result, AI systems can find loopholes that help them accomplish the specified objective efficiently but in unintended, possibly harmful ways.

When a misaligned AI system is deployed, it can have consequential side effects. Social media platforms have been known to optimize for clickthrough rates, causing user addiction on a global scale.{{r|Unsolved2022}} Stanford researchers say that such [[recommender system]]s are misaligned with their users because they "optimize simple engagement metrics rather than a harder-to-measure combination of societal and consumer well-being".{{r|Opportunities_Risks}}

Explaining such side effects, Berkeley computer scientist [[Stuart J. Russell|Stuart Russell]] noted that harm can result if implicit constraints are omitted during training: "A system... will often set... unconstrained variables to extreme values; if one of those unconstrained variables is actually something we care about, the solution found may be highly undesirable. This is essentially the old story of the genie in the lamp, or the sorcerer's apprentice, or King Midas: you get exactly what you ask for, not what you want."<ref>{{Cite web |last=Russell|first=Stuart|website=Edge.org |title=Of Myths and Moonshine|url=https://www.edge.org/conversation/the-myth-of-ai |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230210114137/https://www.edge.org/conversation/the-myth-of-ai |archive-date=February 10, 2023 |accessdate=2022-07-19}}</ref>

Some researchers suggest that AI designers specify their desired goals by listing forbidden actions or by formalizing ethical rules (as with Asimov's [[Three Laws of Robotics]]).<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Tasioulas |first=John |year=2019 |title=First Steps Towards an Ethics of Robots and Artificial Intelligence |journal=Journal of Practical Ethics |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=61–95}}</ref> But [[Stuart J. Russell|Russell]] and [[Peter Norvig|Norvig]] argue that this approach overlooks the complexity of human values:<ref name=":2102" /> "It is certainly very hard, and perhaps impossible, for mere humans to anticipate and rule out in advance all the disastrous ways the machine could choose to achieve a specified objective."<ref name=":2102" />

Additionally, even if an AI system fully understands human intentions, it may still disregard them, because following human intentions may not be its objective (unless it is already fully aligned).<ref name="aima4" />

=== Pressure to deploy unsafe systems ===
Commercial organizations sometimes have incentives to take shortcuts on safety and to deploy misaligned or unsafe AI systems.{{r|Unsolved2022}} For example, social media [[recommender system]]s have been profitable despite creating unwanted addiction and polarization.{{r|Opportunities_Risks}}<ref name=":722">{{Cite news |last1=Wells |first1=Georgia |last2=Deepa Seetharaman |last3=Horwitz |first3=Jeff |date=2021-11-05 |title=Is Facebook Bad for You?

=== Risks from advanced misaligned AI ===
Some researchers are interested in aligning increasingly advanced AI systems, as progress in AI is rapid, and industry and governments are trying to build advanced AI. As AI systems become more advanced, they could unlock many opportunities if they are aligned but may also become harder to align and could pose large-scale hazards.<ref name=":2102" />

==== Development of advanced AI ====

==== Power-seeking ====
{{As of|2023|05|alt=Current|df=US}} systems still lack capabilities such as long-term [[Automated planning and scheduling|planning]] and [[Situation awareness|situational awareness]].{{r|Opportunities_Risks}} But future systems (not necessarily AGIs) with these capabilities are expected to develop unwanted [[#Power-seeking and instrumental strategies|''power-seeking'']] strategies. Future advanced AI agents might, for example, seek to acquire money and computation power, to proliferate, or to evade being turned off (for example, by running additional copies of the system on other computers). Although power-seeking is not explicitly programmed, it can emerge because agents that have more power are better able to accomplish their goals.{{r|Opportunities_Risks|Carlsmith2022}} This tendency, known as [[instrumental convergence]], has already emerged in various [[reinforcement learning]] agents including language models.<ref name=":3">{{Cite journal |last1=Pan |first1=Alexander |last2=Shern |first2=Chan Jun |last3=Zou |first3=Andy |last4=Li |first4=Nathaniel |last5=Basart |first5=Steven |last6=Woodside |first6=Thomas |last7=Ng |first7=Jonathan |last8=Zhang |first8=Emmons |last9=Scott |first9=Dan |last10=Hendrycks |date=2023-04-03 |title=Do the Rewards Justify the Means?

== Research problems and approaches ==
=== Learning human values and preferences ===
Aligning AI systems to act in accordance with human values, goals, and preferences is challenging: these values are taught by humans who make mistakes, harbor biases, and have complex, evolving values that are hard to completely specify.{{r|Gabriel2020}} AI systems often learn to {{clarify|text=exploit|reason=this has an unwarranted implication of deviousness|date=May 2023}} even minor imperfections in the specified objective, a tendency known as specification gaming or reward hacking{{r|concrete2016|SpecGaming2020}} (which are instances of [[Goodhart's law]]<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Rochon |first1=Louis-Philippe |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6kzfBgAAQBAJ |title=The Encyclopedia of Central Banking |last2=Rossi |first2=Sergio |date=2015-02-27 |publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing |isbn=978-1-78254-744-0 |language=en |access-date=September 13, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230210114225/https://books.google.com/books?id=6kzfBgAAQBAJ |archive-date=February 10, 2023 |url-status=live}}</ref>).{{repetition inline|date=May 2023}} Researchers aim to specify intended behavior as completely as possible using datasets that represent human values, imitation learning, or preference learning.{{r|Christian2020|at=Chapter 7}} A central open problem is [[#Scalable oversight|''scalable oversight'']], the difficulty of supervising an AI system that can outperform or mislead humans in a given domain.{{r|concrete2016}}

Because it is difficult for AI designers to explicitly specify an objective function, they often train AI systems to imitate human examples and demonstrations of desired behavior.

Other researchers explore how to teach AI models complex behavior through [[reinforcement learning from human feedback|preference learning]], in which humans provide feedback on which behavior they prefer.{{r|prefsurvey2017|LessToxic}} To minimize the need for human feedback, a helper model is then trained to reward the main model in novel situations for behavior that humans would reward. Researchers at OpenAI used this approach to train chatbots like [[ChatGPT]] and InstructGPT, which produces more compelling text than models trained to imitate humans.{{r|feedback2022}} Preference learning has also been an influential tool for recommender systems and web search.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Fürnkranz |first1=Johannes |last2=Hüllermeier |first2=Eyke |last3=Rudin |first3=Cynthia |last4=Slowinski |first4=Roman |last5=Sanner |first5=Scott |year=2014 |others=Marc Herbstritt |title=Preference Learning |url=http://drops.dagstuhl.de/opus/volltexte/2014/4550/ |url-status=live |journal=Dagstuhl Reports |language=en |volume=4 |issue=3 |pages=27 pages |doi=10.4230/DAGREP.4.3.1 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230210114221/https://drops.dagstuhl.de/opus/volltexte/2014/4550/ |archive-date=February 10, 2023 |access-date=September 12, 2022}}</ref> However, an open problem is ''proxy gaming'': the helper model may not represent human feedback perfectly, and the main model may {{clarify|text=exploit|reason="exploit" implies deliberate deviousness|date=May 2023}} this mismatch to gain more reward.{{r|concrete2016}}<ref>{{Cite arXiv |last1=Gao |first1=Leo |last2=Schulman |first2=John |last3=Hilton |first3=Jacob |date=2022-10-19 |title=Scaling Laws for Reward Model Overoptimization |class=cs.LG |eprint=2210.10760 }}</ref> AI systems may also gain reward by obscuring unfavorable information, misleading human rewarders, or pandering to their views regardless of truth, creating [[Echo chamber (media)|echo chambers]]{{r|dllmmwe2022}} (see {{Section link||Scalable oversight}}).

AI researcher Paul Christiano argues that if the designers of an AI system cannot supervise it to pursue a complex objective, they may keep training the system using easy-to-evaluate proxy objectives such as maximizing simple human feedback. As AI systems make progressively more decisions, the world may be increasingly optimized for easy-to-measure objectives such as making profits, getting clicks, and acquiring positive feedback from humans. As a result, human values and good governance may have progressively less influence.<ref>{{Cite podcast |number=44 |last=Wiblin |first=Robert |title=Dr Paul Christiano on how OpenAI is developing real solutions to the 'AI alignment problem', and his vision of how humanity will progressively hand over decision-making to AI systems |series=80,000 hours |accessdate=2022-07-23 |date=October 2, 2018 |url=https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/paul-christiano-ai-alignment-solutions/ |archive-date=December 14, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221214050326/https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/paul-christiano-ai-alignment-solutions/ |url-status=live}}</ref>

Some AI systems have discovered that they can gain positive feedback more easily by taking actions that falsely convince the human supervisor that the AI has achieved the intended objective. An example is given in the video above, where a simulated robotic arm learned to create the false impression that it had grabbed a ball.{{repetition inline|date=May 2023}}{{r|lfhp2017}} Some AI systems have also learned to recognize when they are being evaluated, and "play dead", stopping unwanted behavior only to continue it once evaluation ends.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Lehman |first1=Joel |last2=Clune |first2=Jeff |last3=Misevic |first3=Dusan |last4=Adami |first4=Christoph |last5=Altenberg |first5=Lee |last6=Beaulieu |first6=Julie |last7=Bentley |first7=Peter J. |last8=Bernard |first8=Samuel |last9=Beslon |first9=Guillaume |last10=Bryson |first10=David M. |last11=Cheney |first11=Nick |year=2020 |title=The Surprising Creativity of Digital Evolution: A Collection of Anecdotes from the Evolutionary Computation and Artificial Life Research Communities |url=https://direct.mit.edu/artl/article/26/2/274-306/93255 |url-status=live |journal=Artificial Life |language=en |volume=26 |issue=2 |pages=274–306 |doi=10.1162/artl_a_00319 |issn=1064-5462 |pmid=32271631 |s2cid=4519185 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221010143108/https://direct.mit.edu/artl/article/26/2/274-306/93255 |archive-date=October 10, 2022 |access-date=September 12, 2022}}</ref> This deceptive specification gaming could become easier for more sophisticated future AI systems{{r|mmmm2022|Superintelligence}} that attempt more complex and difficult-to-evaluate tasks, and could obscure their deceptive behavior.

=== Power-seeking and instrumental strategies ===
[[File:Power-Seeking Image.png|thumb|upright=1.3|Advanced misaligned AI systems would have an incentive to seek power in various ways, since power would help them accomplish their given objective.]]
Since the 1950s, AI researchers have striven to build advanced AI systems that can achieve large-scale goals by predicting the results of their actions and making long-term [[Automated planning and scheduling|plans]].<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=McCarthy |first1=John |last2=Minsky |first2=Marvin L. |last3=Rochester |first3=Nathaniel |last4=Shannon |first4=Claude E. |date=2006-12-15 |title=A Proposal for the Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence, August 31, 1955 |url=https://ojs.aaai.org/aimagazine/index.php/aimagazine/article/view/1904 |journal=AI Magazine |language=en |volume=27 |issue=4 |pages=12 |doi=10.1609/aimag.v27i4.1904 |s2cid=19439915 |issn=2371-9621}}</ref> Some AI researchers argue that suitably advanced planning systems will seek power over their environment, including over humans—for example, by evading shutdown, proliferating, and acquiring resources. Such power-seeking behavior is not explicitly programmed but emerges because power is instrumental in achieving a wide range of goals.{{r|optsp|:2102|Carlsmith2022}} Power-seeking is considered a [[Instrumental convergence|''convergent instrumental goal'']] and can be a form of specification gaming.{{r|Superintelligence}} Leading computer scientists such as [[Geoffrey Hinton]] have argued that future power-seeking AI systems could pose an [[existential risk]].<ref>{{Cite web |title='The Godfather of A.I.' warns of 'nightmare scenario' where artificial intelligence begins to seek power |url=https://fortune.com/2023/05/02/godfather-ai-geoff-hinton-google-warns-artificial-intelligence-nightmare-scenario/ |access-date=2023-05-04 |website=Fortune |language=en}}

Power-seeking is expected to increase in advanced systems that can foresee the results of their actions and strategically plan. Mathematical work has shown that optimal [[reinforcement learning]] agents will seek power by seeking ways to gain more options (e.g. through self-preservation), a behavior that persists across a wide range of environments and goals.{{r|optsp}}

Power-seeking has emerged in some real-world systems. [[Reinforcement learning]] systems have gained more options by acquiring and protecting resources, sometimes in unintended ways.<ref name="quanta-hide-seek2">{{Cite web |last=Ornes |first=Stephen |date=2019-11-18 |title=Playing Hide-and-Seek, Machines Invent New Tools |url=https://www.quantamagazine.org/artificial-intelligence-discovers-tool-use-in-hide-and-seek-games-20191118/ |accessdate=2022-08-26 |work=Quanta Magazine|archive-date=February 10, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230210114137/https://www.quantamagazine.org/artificial-intelligence-discovers-tool-use-in-hide-and-seek-games-20191118/ |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last1=Baker |first1=Bowen |last2=Kanitscheider |first2=Ingmar |last3=Markov |first3=Todor |last4=Wu |first4=Yi |last5=Powell |first5=Glenn |last6=McGrew |first6=Bob |last7=Mordatch |first7=Igor |date=2019-09-17 |title=Emergent Tool Use from Multi-Agent Interaction |url=https://openai.com/blog/emergent-tool-use/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220925043450/https://openai.com/blog/emergent-tool-use/ |archive-date=September 25, 2022 |accessdate=2022-08-26 |work=OpenAI}}</ref> Some [[language model]]s seek power in text-based social environments by gaining money, resources, or social influence.<ref name=":3" /> Other AI systems have learned, in toy environments, that they can better accomplish their given goal by preventing human interference{{r|Gridworlds}} or disabling their off switch.{{r|OffSwitch}} [[Stuart J. Russell|Stuart Russell]] illustrated this strategy by imagining a robot that is tasked to fetch coffee and so evades shutdown since "you can't fetch the coffee if you're dead".<ref name=":2102" /> Language models trained with human feedback {{as of|2022|alt=increasingly}} object to being shut down or modified and express a desire for more resources, arguing that this would help them achieve their purpose.{{r|dllmmwe2022}}

Researchers aim to create systems that are "corrigible": systems that allow themselves to be turned off or modified. An unsolved challenge is ''specification gaming'': if researchers penalize an AI system when they detect it seeking power, the system is thereby incentivized to seek power in ways that are hard to detect,{{r|Unsolved2022}} or hidden during training and safety testing (see {{Section link||Scalable oversight}} and {{Section link||Emergent goals}}). As a result, AI designers may deploy the system by accident, believing it to be more aligned than it is. To detect such deception, researchers aim to create techniques and tools to inspect AI models and to understand the inner workings of [[Black box|black-box]] models such as neural networks.

Additionally, researchers propose to solve the problem of systems disabling their off switches by making AI agents uncertain about the objective they are pursuing.{{r|:2102|OffSwitch}} Agents designed in this way would allow humans to turn them off, since this would indicate that the agent was wrong about the value of whatever action it was taking before being shut down. More research is needed to successfully implement this.{{r|Christian2020}}

Power-seeking AI poses unusual risks. Ordinary safety-critical systems like planes and bridges are not ''adversarial'': they lack the ability and incentive to evade safety measures or deliberately appear safer than they are, whereas power-seeking AIs have been compared to hackers who deliberately evade security measures.{{r|Carlsmith2022}}

Furthermore, ordinary technologies can be made safer by trial and error. In contrast, hypothetical power-seeking AI systems have been compared to viruses: once released, they cannot be contained, since they continuously evolve and grow in number, potentially much faster than human society can adapt.{{r|Carlsmith2022}} As this process continues, it might lead to the complete disempowerment or extinction of humans. For these reasons, many researchers argue that the alignment problem must be solved early, before advanced power-seeking AI is created.{{r|Superintelligence}}

Critics have argued that power-seeking is not inevitable, since humans do not always seek power and may do so only for evolutionary reasons that do not apply to AI systems.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Shermer |first=Michael |date=2017-03-01 |title=Artificial Intelligence Is Not a Threat—Yet |url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/artificial-intelligence-is-not-a-threat-mdash-yet/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201051401/https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/artificial-intelligence-is-not-a-threat-mdash-yet/ |archive-date=December 1, 2017 |accessdate=2022-08-26 |work=Scientific American}}</ref> Furthermore, it is debated whether future AI systems will pursue goals and make long-term plans.{{efn|On the one hand, currently popular systems such as chatbots only provide services of limited scope lasting no longer than the time of a converstion, which requires little or no planning. The success of such approaches may indicate that future systems will also lack goal-directed planning, especially over long horizons. On the other hand, models are increasingly trained using goal-directed methods such as reinforcement learning (e.g. ChatGPT) and explicitly planning architectures (e.g. AlphaGo Zero). As planning over long horizons is often helpful for humans, some researchers argue that companies will automate it once models become capable of it.{{r|Carlsmith2022}} Similarly, political leaders may see an advance in developing the powerful AI systems that can outmaneuver adversaries through planninng. Alternatively, long-term planning might emerge as a byproduct because it is useful e.g. for models that are trained to predict the actions of humans who themselves perform long-term planning.{{r|Opportunities_Risks}} Nonetheless, the majority of AI systems may remain myopic and perform no long-term planning.}} It is also debated whether power-seeking AI systems would be able to disempower humanity.{{r|Carlsmith2022}}

Alignment research distinguishes between the optimization process, which is used to train the system to pursue specified goals, from emergent optimization, which the resulting system performs internally. Carefully specifying the desired objective is called ''outer alignment'', and ensuring that emergent goals match the system's specified goals is called ''inner alignment''.{{r|dlp2023}}

One way that emergent goals can become misaligned is ''goal misgeneralization'', in which the AI competently pursues an emergent goal that leads to aligned behavior on the training data but not elsewhere.{{r|gmdrl}}<ref name=GoalMisgeneralization>{{Cite journal |last1=Shah |first1=Rohin |last2=Varma |first2=Vikrant |last3=Kumar |first3=Ramana |last4=Phuong |first4=Mary |last5=Krakovna |first5=Victoria |last6=Uesato |first6=Jonathan |last7=Kenton |first7=Zac |date=2022-11-02 |title=Goal Misgeneralization: Why Correct Specifications Aren't Enough For Correct Goals|arxiv=2210.01790|url=https://deepmindsafetyresearch.medium.com/goal-misgeneralisation-why-correct-specifications-arent-enough-for-correct-goals-cf96ebc60924 |accessdate=2023-04-02 |journal=Medium }}</ref><ref name=rloamls>{{Cite arXiv|last1=Hubinger |first1=Evan |last2=van Merwijk |first2=Chris |last3=Mikulik |first3=Vladimir |last4=Skalse |first4=Joar |last5=Garrabrant |first5=Scott |date=2021-12-01 |title=Risks from Learned Optimization in Advanced Machine Learning Systems |class=cs.AI |eprint=1906.01820 }}</ref> Goal misgeneralization arises from goal ambiguity (i.e. [[Identifiability|non-identifiability]]). Even if an AI system's behavior satisfies the training objective, this may be compatible with learned goals that differ from the desired goals in important ways. Since pursuing each goal leads to good performance during training, the problem becomes apparent only after deployment, in novel situations in which the system continues to pursue the wrong goal. The system may act misaligned even when it understands that a different goal was desired, because its behavior is determined only by the emergent goal.{{citation needed|date=May 2023}} Such goal misgeneralization{{r|gmdrl}} presents a challenge: an AI system's designers may not notice that their system has misaligned emergent goals, since they do not become visible during the training phase.<!--Research directions and problems-->

Goal misgeneralization has been observed in language models, navigation agents, and game-playing agents.{{r|gmdrl|GoalMisgeneralization}} It is often explained by analogy to biological evolution.{{r|Christian2020|at=Chapter 5}} Evolution is an optimization process of a sort, like the optimization algorithms used to train [[machine learning]] systems. In the ancestral environment, evolution selected human genes for high [[Inclusive fitness|inclusive genetic fitness]], but humans pursue emergent goals other than this. Fitness corresponds to the specified goal used in the training environment and training data. But in evolutionary history, maximizing the fitness specification gave rise to goal-directed agents, humans, who do not directly pursue inclusive genetic fitness. Instead, they pursue emergent goals that correlated with genetic fitness in the ancestral "training" environment: nutrition, sex, and so on. Now our environment has changed: a [[Domain adaptation|distribution shift]] has occurred. We continue to pursue the same emergent goals, but this no longer maximizes genetic fitness. Our taste for sugary food (an emergent goal) was originally aligned with inclusive fitness, but now leads to overeating and health problems. Sexual desire originally led us to have more offspring, but we now use contraception, decoupling sex from genetic fitness.

Researchers aim to detect and remove unwanted emergent goals using approaches including red teaming, verification, anomaly detection, and interpretability.{{r|concrete2016|Unsolved2022|building2018}} Progress on these techniques may help mitigate two open problems:
# Emergent goals only become apparent when the system is deployed outside its training environment, but it can be unsafe to deploy a misaligned system in high-stakes environments—even for a short time to allow its misalignment to be detected. Such high stakes are common in autonomous driving, health care, and military applications.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Zhang |first1=Xiaoge |last2=Chan |first2=Felix T.S. |last3=Yan |first3=Chao |last4=Bose |first4=Indranil |year=2022 |title=Towards risk-aware artificial intelligence and machine learning systems: An overview |url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0167923622000719 |journal=Decision Support Systems |language=en |volume=159 |pages=113800 |doi=10.1016/j.dss.2022.113800|s2cid=248585546 }}</ref> The stakes become higher yet when AI systems gain more autonomy and capability and can sidestep human intervention (see {{Section link||Power-seeking}}).
# A sufficiently capable AI system might take actions that falsely convince the human supervisor that the AI is pursuing the specified objective, which helps the system gain more reward and autonomy{{r|GoalMisgeneralization|Carlsmith2022|rloamls|Opportunities_Risks}} (see the discussion on deception at {{Section link||Scalable oversight}} and {{Section link||Honest AI}}).

=== Embedded agency ===
Work in AI and alignment largely occurs within formalisms such as [[partially observable Markov decision process]]. Existing formalisms assume that an AI agent's algorithm is executed outside the environment (i.e. is not physically embedded in it). Embedded agency{{r|AGISafetyLitReview}}<ref>{{Cite arXiv |eprint=1902.09469 |class=cs.AI |first1=Abram |last1=Demski |first2=Scott |last2=Garrabrant |title=Embedded Agency |date=6 October 2020}}</ref> is another major strand of research that attempts to solve problems arising from the mismatch between such theoretical frameworks and real agents we might build.

For example, even if the scalable oversight problem is solved, an agent that can gain access to the computer it is running on may have an incentive to tamper with its reward function in order to get much more reward than its human supervisors give it.<ref name="causal_influence2">{{Cite arXiv |eprint=1902.09980 |class=cs.AI |first1=Tom |last1=Everitt |first2=Pedro A. |last2=Ortega |title=Understanding Agent Incentives using Causal Influence Diagrams.

Researchers at [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[DeepMind]] have argued that such problematic behavior is highly likely in advanced systems, and that advanced systems would seek power to stay in control of their reward signal indefinitely and certainly.<ref name=":323">{{Cite journal |last1=Cohen |first1=Michael K. |last2=Hutter |first2=Marcus |last3=Osborne |first3=Michael A. |date=2022-08-29 |title=Advanced artificial agents intervene in the provision of reward |url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/aaai.12064 |url-status=live |journal=AI Magazine |language=en |volume=43 |issue=3 |pages=282–293 |doi=10.1002/aaai.12064 |issn=0738-4602 |s2cid=235489158 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230210153534/https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/aaai.12064 |archive-date=February 10, 2023 |access-date=September 6, 2022}}</ref> They suggest a range of potential approaches to address this open problem.

=== Principal-agent problems ===
The alignment problem has many parallels with the [[principal-agent problem]] in [[organizational economics]].<ref name="Hadfield-Menell2019"> {{Cite conference | last1 = Hadfield-Menell | first1 = Dylan | last2 = Hadfield | first2 = Gillian K | title = Incomplete contracting and AI alignment | book-title = Proceedings of the 2019 AAAI/ACM Conference on AI, Ethics, and Society | year = 2019 | pages = 417–422 }}</ref> In a principal-agent problem, a principal, e.g. a firm, hires an agent to perform some task. In the context of AI safety, a human would typically take the principal role and the AI would take the agent role.

As with the alignment problem, the principal and the agent differ in their utility functions. But in contrast to the alignment problem, the principal cannot coerce the agent into changing its utility, e.g. through training, but rather must use exogenous factors, such as incentive schemes, to bring about outcomes compatible with the principal's utility function. Some researchers argue that principal-agent problems are more realistic representations of AI safety problems likely to be encountered in the real world.<ref name="Hanson2019">{{Cite web | url=https://www.overcomingbias.com/p/agency-failure-ai-apocalypsehtml | title=Agency Failure or AI Apocalypse? | last = Hanson | first = Robin | date = 2019-04-10 | website = Overcoming Bias| access-date = 2023-09-20}}</ref><ref name="Phelps2023"/>

A number of governmental and treaty organizations have made statements emphasizing the importance of AI alignment.

In September 2021, the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]] issued a declaration that included a call to regulate AI to ensure it is "aligned with shared global values".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/content/common-agenda-report/|title=UN Secretary-General's report on "Our Common Agenda"|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230216065407/https://www.un.org/en/content/common-agenda-report/ |archive-date=February 16, 2023 |year=2021|page=63|quote=[T]he Compact could also promote regulation of artificial intelligence to ensure that this is aligned with shared global values}}</ref>

That same month, the [[People's Republic of China|PRC]] published ethical guidelines for AI in China. According to the guidelines, researchers must ensure that AI abides by shared human values, is always under human control, and does not endanger public safety.<ref>{{cite web|author=The National New Generation Artificial Intelligence Governance Specialist Committee|title=Ethical Norms for New Generation Artificial Intelligence Released|orig-date=2021-09-25|date=2021-10-12|url=https://cset.georgetown.edu/publication/ethical-norms-for-new-generation-artificial-intelligence-released/|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230210114220/https://cset.georgetown.edu/publication/ethical-norms-for-new-generation-artificial-intelligence-released/ |archive-date=2023-02-10|translator=[[Center for Security and Emerging Technology]]}}</ref>

In March 2021, the US National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence said: "Advances in AI... could lead to inflection points or leaps in capabilities.

==Dynamic nature of alignment==

AI alignment is often perceived as a fixed objective, but some researchers argue it is more appropriately viewed as an evolving process.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Chern number in Ising models with spatially modulated real and complex fields |first1=Geoffrey |last1=Irving |first2=Amanda |last2=Askell |journal=Physical Review A |date=June 9, 2016 |volume=94 |issue=5 |page=052113 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevA.94.052113 |arxiv=1606.03535 |s2cid=118699363 }}</ref> As AI technologies advance and human values and preferences change, alignment solutions must also adapt dynamically.<ref name="auto">{{cite arXiv |title=AI Safety Needs Social Scientists |first1=Andrew |last1=Critch |first2=David |last2=Krueger |date=February 8, 2022 |class=cs.CR |eprint=2202.03866 }}</ref> This dynamic nature of alignment has several implications:

* AI alignment solutions require continuous updating in response to AI advancements. A static, one-time alignment approach may not suffice.<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11023-020-09539-2 |title=Artificial Intelligence, Values, and Alignment |first=Iason |last=Gabriel |date=September 1, 2020 |journal=Minds and Machines|volume=30 |issue=3 |pages=411–437 |doi=10.1007/s11023-020-09539-2 |s2cid=210920551 }}</ref>

* Alignment goals can evolve along with shifts in human values and priorities. Hence, the ongoing inclusion of diverse human perspectives is crucial.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/HBxe6wdjxK239zajf/what-failure-looks-like |title=What failure looks like |first=Paul |last=Christiano |date=October 19, 2018 |website=Alignment Forum}}</ref>

* Varying historical contexts and technological landscapes may necessitate distinct alignment strategies. This calls for a flexible approach and responsiveness to changing conditions.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/566677/human-compatible-by-stuart-russell/ |title=Human Compatible: Artificial Intelligence and the Problem of Control |first=Stuart J. |last=Russell |date=2019 |publisher=Penguin Random House}}</ref>

* The feasibility of a permanent, "fixed" alignment solution remains uncertain. This raises the potential need for continuous oversight of the AI-human relationship.<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1420-6 |title=AI policy: A roadmap |first=Allan |last=Dafoe |date=2019 |journal=Nature}}</ref>

* Ethical development and deployment of AI are just as critical as the end goal. Ethical progress is necessary for genuine progress.<ref name="auto"/>

In essence, AI alignment is not a static destination but an open, flexible process. Alignment solutions that continually adapt to ethical considerations may offer the most robust approach.<ref name="auto"/> This perspective could guide both effective policy-making and technical research in AI.
