'''Bioelectromagnetics''', also known as '''bioelectromagnetism''', is the study of the interaction between [[electromagnetic field]]s and biological entities. Areas of study include [[electromagnetic field]]s produced by living [[cell (biology)|cell]]s, [[biological tissue|tissue]]s or [[organism]]s, the effects of man-made sources of electromagnetic fields like [[mobile phone]]s, and the application of electromagnetic radiation toward therapies for the treatment of various conditions.

==Biological phenomena==
[[File:EM Spectrum Properties edit.svg|thumb|Interactions of organisms with electromagnetic fields from across the [[electromagnetic spectrum]] are part of bioelectromagnetic studies.]]

Bioelectromagnetism is studied primarily through the techniques of [[electrophysiology]]. In the late eighteenth century, the [[Italy|Italian]] [[physician]] and [[physicist]] [[Luigi Galvani]] first recorded the phenomenon while dissecting a [[frog]] at a table where he had been conducting experiments with [[static electricity]]. Galvani coined the term ''animal electricity'' to describe the phenomenon, while contemporaries labeled it [[galvanism]]. Galvani and contemporaries regarded muscle activation as resulting from an electrical fluid or substance in the [[nerve]]s.<ref>{{cite book |last=Myers |first=Richard |title=The basics of chemistry |url=https://archive.org/details/basicsofchemistr0000myer |url-access=registration |year=2003 |publisher=Greenwood Press |location=Westport, Conn. |isbn=978-0-313-31664-7 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/basicsofchemistr0000myer/page/172 172–4] }}</ref> Short-lived electrical events called [[action potentials]] occur in several types of animal cells which are called excitable cells, a category of cell include neurons, muscle cells, and endocrine cells, as well as in some plant cells. These action potentials are used to facilitate inter-cellular communication and activate intracellular processes. The physiological phenomena of action potentials are possible because [[voltage-gated ion channel]]s allow the resting potential caused by [[electrochemical gradient]] on either side of a cell membrane to resolve.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}.

Several animals are suspected to have the ability to sense electromagnetic fields; for example, several aquatic animals have structures potentially capable of sensing [[electromagnetic induction|changes in voltage]] caused by a changing magnetic field,<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Mouritsen |first1=Henrik |s2cid=46953903 |title=Long-distance navigation and magnetoreception in migratory animals |journal=Nature |date=June 2018 |volume=558 |issue=7708 |pages=50–59 |doi=10.1038/s41586-018-0176-1 |pmid=29875486 |bibcode=2018Natur.558...50M }}</ref> while migratory birds are thought to use [[magnetoreception]] in navigation.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Wiltschko |first1=Roswitha |last2=Wiltschko |first2=Wolfgang |title=Magnetoreception in birds |journal=Journal of the Royal Society Interface |date=4 September 2019 |volume=16 |issue=158 |pages=20190295 |doi=10.1098/rsif.2019.0295 |pmid=31480921 |pmc=6769297 |doi-access=free }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Wu |first1=Le-Qing |last2=Dickman |first2=J.

==Bioeffects of electromagnetic radiation==
Most of the molecules in the human body interact weakly with [[electromagnetic fields]] in the [[radio frequency]] or [[extremely low frequency]] bands.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} One such interaction is absorption of energy from the fields, which can cause tissue to heat up; more intense fields will produce greater heating. This can lead to biological effects ranging from muscle relaxation (as produced by a [[diathermy]] device) to burns.<ref>{{cite web |title=Hazards of the MR Environment |publisher=Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging
 |url=http://www.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/martinos/userInfo/safety/safetyHazards.php |access-date=19 March 2013}}</ref> Many nations and regulatory bodies like the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection have established safety guidelines to limit EMF exposure to a non-thermal level. This can be defined as either heating only to the point where the excess heat can be dissipated, or as a fixed increase in temperature not detectable with current instruments like 0.1&nbsp;°C.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} However, biological effects have been shown to be present for these non-thermal exposures;{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} Various mechanisms have been proposed to explain these,<ref>Binhi, 2002</ref> and there may be several mechanisms  underlying the differing phenomena observed.

Many behavioral effects at different intensities have been reported from exposure to magnetic fields, particularly with pulsed magnetic fields. The specific pulseform used appears to be an important factor for the behavioural effect seen; for example, a pulsed magnetic field originally designed for spectroscopic [[MRI]], referred to as [[Low Field Magnetic Stimulation]], was found to temporarily improve patient-reported mood in bipolar patients,<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.161.1.93 |pmid=14702256 |title=Low-Field Magnetic Stimulation in Bipolar Depression Using an MRI-Based Stimulator |journal=American Journal of Psychiatry |volume=161 |issue=1 |pages=93–8 |year=2004 |last1=Rohan |first1=Michael |last2=Parow |first2=Aimee |last3=Stoll |first3=Andrew L |last4=Demopulos |first4=Christina |last5=Friedman |first5=Seth |last6=Dager |first6=Stephen |last7=Hennen |first7=John |last8=Cohen |first8=Bruce M |last9=Renshaw |first9=Perry F |s2cid=14432285 |url=http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/838d/5c50eb9bc3e2347a7bf7222aca4f9d0aa9a6.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190227163048/http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/838d/5c50eb9bc3e2347a7bf7222aca4f9d0aa9a6.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=2019-02-27 }}</ref> while another MRI pulse had no effect.

A strong changing magnetic field can induce electrical currents in conductive tissue such as the brain. Since the magnetic field penetrates tissue, it can be generated outside of the head to induce currents within, causing [[transcranial magnetic stimulation]] (TMS). These currents depolarize neurons in a selected part of the brain, leading to changes in the patterns of neural activity.<ref>Todd Hutton, Karl Lanocha, M.D Richard Bermudes, Kimberly Cress.

Instead of one strong electric shock through the head as in ECT, a large number of relatively weak pulses are delivered in TMS therapy, typically at the rate of about 10 pulses per second. If very strong pulses at a rapid rate are delivered to the brain, the induced currents can cause convulsions much like in the original [[electroconvulsive therapy]].<ref name=Wassermann1998>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0168-5597(97)00096-8 |pmid=9474057 |title=Risk and safety of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation: Report and suggested guidelines from the International Workshop on the Safety of Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation, June 5–7, 1996 |journal= Electroencephalography and Clinical Neurophysiology/Evoked Potentials Section|volume=108 |issue=1 |pages=1–16 |year=1998 |last1=Wassermann |first1=Eric M |url=https://zenodo.org/record/1259909 }}</ref><ref name = Rossi>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.clinph.2009.08.016 |pmid=19833552 |pmc=3260536 |title=Safety, ethical considerations, and application guidelines for the use of transcranial magnetic stimulation in clinical practice and research |journal=Clinical Neurophysiology |volume=120 |issue=12 |pages=2008–39 |year=2009 |last1=Rossi |first1=Simone |last2=Hallett |first2=Mark |last3=Rossini |first3=Paolo M |last4=Pascual-Leone |first4=Alvaro |hdl=11572/145680 }}</ref> Sometimes, this is done deliberately in order to treat depression, such as in ECT.

Electromagnetic radiation in the intermediate frequency range has found a place in modern medical practice for the treatment of bone healing and for nerve stimulation and regeneration. It is also approved as cancer therapy in form of [[Tumor Treating Fields]], using alternating electric fields in the frequency range of 100–300&nbsp;kHz.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} Since some of these methods involve magnetic fields that invoke electric currents in biological tissues and others only involve electric fields, they are strictly speaking [[electrotherapy|electrotherapies]] albeit their application modi with modern electronic equipment have placed them in the category of bioelectromagnetic interactions.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}
