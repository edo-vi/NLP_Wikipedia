== Response ==
The Ministry of Health in the Republic of Korea monitored at least 21 individuals who were in close contact with the confirmed case, and placed all identified close contacts in quarantine at their homes.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=https://www.who.int/csr/don/12-september-2018-mers-republic-of-korea/en/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180915215239/http://www.who.int/csr/don/12-september-2018-mers-republic-of-korea/en/|url-status=dead|archive-date=September 15, 2018|title=Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection – Republic of Korea|website=World Health Organization|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-09-13}}</ref>

=== World Health Organization ===
The confirmed case in Korea did not change the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) overall global risk assessment for the disease, and WHO also stated that any additional confirmed cases would also not change the risk, which was deemed as low.<ref name=":1" /> However, it does recommend countries to continue to monitor potential cases and to carefully record any unusual patterns.{{cn|date=June 2021}}

=== European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control ===
After the confirmed case in the United Kingdom, the [[European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control|ECDC]] repeated their risk assessment<ref>{{Cite journal|last=EDCD|date=11 June 2015|title=Rapid Risk Assessment - Middle Ease Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV)|url=https://ecdc.europa.eu/sites/portal/files/media/en/publications/Publications/middle-east-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-rapid-risk-assessment-11-June-2015.pdf|journal=EDCE Risk Assessment|volume=1|pages=1–11}}</ref> that close contacts of confirmed cases must be monitored for symptoms for at least 14 days after the last exposure. The organization also repeated that cases of the syndrome were not unexpected and had been observed in Europe before, and the risk of transmission to the general population from the confirmed case was extremely low.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/new-case-mers-cov-identified-united-kingdom|title=New case of MERS-CoV identified in the United Kingdom|website=European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control|date=24 August 2018|language=en|access-date=2018-09-13}}</ref>
