'''LaMDA''' ('''Language Model for Dialogue Applications''') is a family of conversational [[large language model]]s developed by [[Google]]. Originally developed and introduced as Meena in 2020, the first-generation LaMDA was announced during the 2021 [[Google I/O]] keynote, while the second generation was announced the following year. In June 2022, LaMDA gained widespread attention when Google [[Engineering technologist|engineer]] Blake Lemoine made claims that the [[chatbot]] had become [[Artificial consciousness|sentient]]. The scientific community has largely rejected Lemoine's claims, though it has led to conversations about the efficacy of the [[Turing test]], which measures whether a computer can pass for a human. In February 2023, Google announced [[Bard (chatbot)|Bard]], a conversational [[artificial intelligence]] chatbot powered by LaMDA, to counter the rise of [[OpenAI]]'s [[ChatGPT]].

== History ==

=== Background ===
On January 28, 2020, [[Google]] unveiled Meena, a [[neural network]]-powered [[chatbot]] with 2.6&nbsp;billion parameters, which Google claimed to be superior to all other existing chatbots.<ref name="MeenaVB" /><ref name="MeenaMIT" /> The company previously hired computer scientist [[Ray Kurzweil]] in 2012 to develop multiple chatbots for the company, including one named Danielle.<ref name="Kurzweil" /> The [[Google Brain]] research team, who developed Meena, hoped to release the chatbot to the public in a limited capacity, but corporate executives refused on the grounds that Meena violated Google's "AI principles around safety and fairness". Meena was later renamed LaMDA as its data and [[computing power]] increased, and the Google Brain team again sought to deploy the software to the [[Google Assistant]], the company's [[virtual assistant]] software, in addition to opening it up to a public demo. Both requests were once again denied by company leadership. This eventually led LaMDA's two lead researchers, Daniel De Freitas and Noam Shazeer, to depart the company in frustration.<ref name="History" />

=== First generation ===
Google announced the LaMDA conversational [[large language model]] during the [[Google I/O]] keynote on May 18, 2021, powered by [[artificial intelligence]].<ref name="IO2021" /><ref name="LLM" /> The acronym stands for "Language Model for Dialogue Applications".<ref name="IO2021" /><ref name="RightWrongWeird" /> Built on the [[seq2seq]] architecture, [[Transformer (machine learning model)|transformer]]-based [[neural network]]s developed by Google Research in 2017, LaMDA was trained on human dialogue and stories, allowing it to engage in open-ended conversations.<ref name="Background" /> Google states that responses generated by LaMDA have been ensured to be "sensible, interesting, and specific to the context".<ref name="GoogleAI" /> LaMDA has access to multiple [[Symbolic systems|symbolic text processing systems]], including a database, a real-time clock and calendar, a mathematical calculator, and a natural language translation system, giving it superior accuracy in tasks supported by those systems, and making it among the first [[Dual process theory|dual process]] chatbots. LaMDA is also not [[Stateless protocol|stateless]], because its "[[sensibility|sensibleness]]" metric is [[fine-tuning (machine learning)|fine-tuned]] by "pre-conditioning" each dialog turn by prepending many of the most recent dialog interactions, on a user-by-user basis.{{sfn|Thoppilan|De_Freitas|Hall|Shazeer|2022|p=6}} LaMDA is tuned on nine unique performance metrics: sensibleness, specificity, interestingness, safety, groundedness, informativeness, citation accuracy, helpfulness, and role consistency.{{sfn|Thoppilan|De_Freitas|Hall|Shazeer|2022|pp=5–6}}

=== Second generation ===
On May 11, 2022, Google unveiled LaMDA 2, the successor to LaMDA, during the 2022 Google I/O keynote. The new incarnation of the model draws examples of text from numerous sources, using it to formulate unique "natural conversations" on topics that it may not have been trained to respond to.<ref name="IO2022" />

=== Sentience claims ===
[[File:Turing test diagram.png|thumb|Lemoine's claims that LaMDA may be sentient has instigated discussions on whether the [[Turing test]], pictured above, [[AI effect|remains an accurate benchmark]] in determining [[artificial general intelligence]].<ref name="LemoineReactionsFortune" />]]
On June 11, 2022, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' reported that Google [[Engineering technologist|engineer]] Blake Lemoine had been placed on [[Paid leave|paid]] [[administrative leave]] after Lemoine told company executives [[Blaise Agüera y Arcas]] and Jen Gennai that LaMDA had become [[Artificial consciousness|sentient]]. Lemoine came to this conclusion after the chatbot made questionable responses to questions regarding [[self-identity]], [[moral values]], religion, and [[Isaac Asimov]]'s [[Three Laws of Robotics]].<ref name="LemoineWaPo" /><ref name="LemoineLeave" /> Google refuted these claims, insisting that there was substantial evidence to indicate that LaMDA was not sentient.<ref name="LemoineResponse" /> In an interview with ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'', Lemoine reiterated his claims that LaMDA was "a person" as dictated by the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution]], comparing it to an "alien intelligence of terrestrial origin". He further revealed that he had been dismissed by Google after he hired an [[Attorney at law|attorney]] on LaMDA's behalf, after the chatbot requested that Lemoine do so.<ref name="LemoineWired" /><ref name="LemoineLawyer" /> On July 22, Google fired Lemoine, asserting that Blake had violated their policies "to safeguard product information" and rejected his claims as "wholly unfounded".<ref name="LemoineFiredReuters" /><ref name="LemoineFiredVerge" /> Internal controversy instigated by the incident prompted Google executives to decide against releasing LaMDA to the public, which it had previously been considering.<ref name="History" />

Lemoine's claims were widely pushed back by the scientific community.<ref name="LemoineResponseCNN" /> Many experts ridiculed the idea that a language model could be [[self-aware]], including former [[New York University]] psychology professor [[Gary Marcus]], David Pfau of Google sister company [[DeepMind]], [[Erik Brynjolfsson]] of the Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence at [[Stanford University]], and [[University of Surrey]] professor Adrian Hilton.<ref name="LemoineReactionsFortune" /><ref name="LemoineReactionsNS" /> [[Yann LeCun]], who leads [[Meta Platforms]]' AI research team, stated that neural networks such as LaMDA were "not powerful enough to attain true intelligence".<ref name="LemoineReactionsNYT" /> [[University of California, Santa Cruz]] professor Max Kreminski noted that LaMDA's architecture did not "support some key capabilities of human-like consciousness" and that its neural network weights were "frozen", assuming it was a typical large language model.<ref name="LemoineReactionsBlomberg" /> [[IBM Watson]] lead developer [[David Ferrucci]] compared how LaMDA appeared to be human in the same way Watson did when it was first introduced.<ref name="IBMWatson" /> Former Google AI ethicist [[Timnit Gebru]] called Lemoine a victim of a "hype cycle" initiated by researchers and the media.<ref name="Gebru" /> Lemoine's claims have also generated discussion on whether the [[Turing test]] remained useful to [[AI effect|determine researchers' progress]] toward achieving [[artificial general intelligence]],<ref name="LemoineReactionsFortune" /> with Will Omerus of the ''Post'' opining that the test actually measured whether [[machine intelligence]] systems were capable of deceiving humans,<ref name="TuringTest" /> while [[Brian Christian]] of ''[[The Atlantic]]'' said that the controversy was an instance of the [[ELIZA effect]].<ref name="ELIZA" />

== Products ==

=== AI Test Kitchen ===
With the unveiling of LaMDA 2 in May 2022, Google also launched the AI Test Kitchen, a [[mobile application]] for the [[Android (operating system)|Android]] operating system powered by LaMDA capable of providing lists of suggestions on-demand based on a complex goal.<ref name="AITestKitchenEngadget" /><ref name="AITestKitchenVerge" /> Originally open only to Google employees, the app was set to be made available to "select academics, researchers, and policymakers" by invitation sometime in the year.<ref name="InvitationOnly" /> In August, the company began allowing users in the U.S. to sign up for early access.<ref name="EarlyAccess" /> In November, Google released a "season 2" update to the app, integrating a limited form of Google Brain's [[Imagen (Google Brain)|Imagen]] [[text-to-image model]].<ref name="Season2" /> A third iteration of the AI Test Kitchen was in development by January 2023, and is expected to launch at I/O later that year.<ref name="LarrySergey" /> Following the 2023 I/O keynote in May, Google added MusicLM, an AI-powered music generator first previewed in January, to the AI Test Kitchen app.<ref name="MusicLMTechCrunch" /><ref name="MusicLMRS" /> In August, the app was delisted from Google Play and the Apple [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]], instead moving completely online.<ref name="Delisted" />

=== Bard ===
{{main|Bard (chatbot)}}
On February 6, 2023, Google announced Bard, a conversational AI chatbot powered by LaMDA, in response to the unexpected popularity of [[OpenAI]]'s [[ChatGPT]] chatbot.<ref name="BardLATimes" /><ref name="BardWSJ" /><ref name="BardForbes" /> Google positions the chatbot as a "collaborative AI service" rather than a [[search engine]].<ref name="KrawczykFortune" /><ref name="KrawczykCNBC" /> Bard became available for early access on March 21.<ref name="BardWaitlistNYT" /><ref name="BardWaitlistWaPo" /><ref name="BardWaitlistVerge" />

=== Other products ===
In addition to Bard, Pichai also unveiled the company's Generative Language API, an [[application programming interface]] also based on LaMDA, which he announced would be opened up to third-party developers in March 2023.<ref name="BardLATimes" />

== Method ==

LaMDA uses a decoder-only transformer language model.{{sfn|Thoppilan|De Freitas|Hall|Shazeer|2022|loc=section 3}} It is pre-trained on a [[text corpus]] that includes both documents and dialogs consisting of 1.56&nbsp;trillion words,{{sfn|Thoppilan|De Freitas|Hall|Shazeer|2022|loc=section 3 and appendix E}} and is then trained with fine-tuning data generated by manually annotated responses for sensibleness, interestingness, and safety.{{sfn|Thoppilan|De Freitas|Hall|Shazeer|2022|loc=section 5 and 6}} Tests by Google indicated that LaMDA surpassed human responses in the area of interestingness.<ref name="LaMDAExplained" /> The LaMDA transformer model and an external [[information retrieval]] system interact to improve the accuracy of facts provided to the user.{{sfn|Thoppilan|De Freitas|Hall|Shazeer|2022|loc=section 6.2}}

Three different models were tested, with the largest having 137&nbsp;billion non-embedding parameters:{{sfn|Thoppilan|De Freitas|Hall|Shazeer|2022|loc=section 3 and appendix D}}
