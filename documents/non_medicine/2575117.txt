'''''Potentilla reptans''''', known as the '''creeping cinquefoil''',<ref>{{PLANTS|id=PORE^|taxon=Potentilla reptans|accessdate=13 October 2015}}</ref>  '''European cinquefoil''' or '''creeping tormentil''', is a [[flowering plant]] in the family [[Rosaceae]].

A creeping [[perennial plant]] native to Eurasia and Northern Africa, ''Potentilla reptans'' has been naturalized elsewhere.<ref>{{GRIN | accessdate = 10 January 2018}}</ref> Its trailing stems root at the [[Node (botany)|node]]s, and leaves are on long [[stalk (botany)|stalk]]s. The plant blooms between June and August with yellow flowers that are about 2&nbsp;cm in diameter and have five heart-shaped petals. ''P. reptans'', which can be easily confused with [[silverweed]], often grows in crushed masonry in the [[South of England]]. The [[grizzled skipper]] butterfly favors the plant.

Alcoholic extracts from roots of ''Potentilla reptans'' showed a moderate antimicrobial activity against common wound pathogens.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Watkins F, Pendry B, Sanchez-Medina A, Corcoran O |title=Antimicrobial assays of three native British plants used in Anglo-Saxon medicine for wound healing formulations in 10th century England |journal=J Ethnopharmacol |volume=144 |issue=2 |pages=408â€“15 |date=November 2012 |pmid=23026307 |doi=10.1016/j.jep.2012.09.031 |url=http://roar.uel.ac.uk/1715/3/2012_Watkins_etal_Antimicrobial.pdf }}</ref>

''Potentilla reptans'' can be an invasive weed in lawns and flowerbeds and difficult to eradicate, particularly when it competes with and infests established groundcovers.  All of the taproots must be dug up, or the plant will reappear.
