{{Short description|Study of the psychological, sociological, and philosophical aspect of texts}}
The '''empirical study of literature''' is an interdisciplinary field of research which includes the [[psychology]], [[Sociology of literature|sociology]], and [[philosophy]] of texts, the contextual study of literature, and the [[History of literature|history]] of [[Reading (process)|reading]] [[Literature|literary]] [[Text (literary theory)|texts]].

The [[International Society for the Empirical Study of Literature]] and Media (IGEL) is one learned association which brings together experts in this field. Major journals in the field are ''[[Poetics (journal)|Poetics: Journal of Empirical Research on Culture, the Media and the Arts]]'',<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.journals.elsevier.com/poetics/|title=Poetics|work=Publisher's Website}}</ref> ''[[Poetics Today: International Journal for Theory and Analysis of Literature and Communication]]'',<ref>{{cite web |url=http://poeticstoday.dukejournals.org/|title=Poetics Today|work=Publisher's Website}}</ref> and ''[[Scientific Study of Literature]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://benjamins.com/#catalog/journals/ssol/main|title=SSOL|work=Publisher's Website}}</ref>

The empirical study of literature attracts [[scholarship]] particularly in the areas of reception and audience studies and in cognitive psychology when it is concerned with questions of reading. In these two areas research and studies based on the framework are steadily growing. Further fields where the framework in various revised and expanded versions attracts scholarship is (comparative) [[cultural studies]] and [[pedagogy]].
