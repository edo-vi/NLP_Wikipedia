A '''vignette''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=en-us-vignette.ogg|v|ɪ|n|ˈ|j|ɛ|t}}, <small>also</small> {{IPAc-en|v|iː|n|ˈ|-}}) is a [[French language|French]] [[loanword]] expressing a short and descriptive piece of writing that captures a brief period in time.<ref name=":2" /><ref name=":1">{{Cite book|last=Akinci|first=Ugur|title=How to Write a Vignette|year=2012}}</ref> Vignettes are more focused on vivid imagery and meaning rather than plot.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|title=The House on Mango Street Writing Style|url=http://www.shmoop.com/house-on-mango-street/writing-style.html|access-date=2016-04-18|website=www.shmoop.com}}</ref> Vignettes can be stand-alone, but they are more commonly part of a larger narrative, such as vignettes found in novels or collections of short stories.<ref name=":1" />

Examples of vignettes include Ernest Hemingway’s ''In Our Time'', Margaret Atwood’s ''The Female Body'', Sandra Cisneros’ ''[[The House on Mango Street]]'', and Alice Walker’s ''The Flowers.''

Vignettes have been particularly influential in the development of the contemporary notions of a [[scene (drama)|scene]] as shown in [[postmodern theater]], [[Postmodernist film|film]] and [[Modern Television|television]], where less emphasis is placed on adhering to the conventions of traditional structure and story development.<ref name=":14" />

== Etymology ==
{{wikt|vignette}}
The word ''vignette'' means "little vine" in [[French language|French]], and was derived from Old French ''vigne'', meaning “[[vineyard]]”.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|title=vignette {{!}} Origin and meaning of vignette by Online Etymology Dictionary|url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/vignette|access-date=2020-11-02|website=www.etymonline.com|language=en}}</ref> In English, the word was first documented in 1751, and was given the definition “decorative design".<ref name=":2" /> This definition refers to decorative artwork of vine-leaves and tendrils used to embellish title pages and the commencement of chapters.<ref name=":0" /> In 1853, the word was used to describe a popular 19th century photographic style, where portraits had blurred edges.<ref name=":2" /> The definition of a vignette referring to a “[[Sketch story|literary sketch]]” was first recorded in 1880.<ref name=":2" /> The idea of the "literary sketch" was derived from the [[Sketch (drawing)|sketch]] in visual arts - a rough or unfinished drawing or painting, showing the main elements of an artwork.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Definition of sketch {{!}} Dictionary.com|url=https://www.dictionary.com/browse/sketch|access-date=2020-11-16|website=www.dictionary.com|language=en}}</ref> This reflects the characteristics of a vignette; brief and spontaneous, with a sense of immediacy.<ref name=":7">{{Cite journal|last=BYERLY|first=ALISON|date=1999|title=Effortless Art: The Sketch in Nineteenth-Century Painting and Literature|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/23124216|journal=Criticism|volume=41|issue=3|pages=349–364|jstor=23124216|issn=0011-1589}}</ref>

== History ==
[[File:T10d009-Histoire des deux indes-Vignette.png|thumb|An example of a vignette used as a decorative artwork]]
In the 19th century, vignettes were found in [[newspaper]]s and acted as brief and vivid descriptions of the news article’s subject, from the perspective of the writer.<ref name=":3">{{Cite book|last=Cordell|first=Ryan|title=Classifying Vignettes, Modeling Hybridity|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|year=2019|location=Minneapolis, MN}}</ref> According to Norman Sims (2007), these vignette sketches “provided writers with something we often miss today: the opportunity to write about ordinary life.”<ref name=":3" /> These 19th century vignettes frequently offered few facts which could be verified, and tended to blend [[journalism]] with [[fiction]].<ref name=":3" /> These vignette sketches provided writers with a sense of imaginative freedom, and reflected the larger [[Victorian era|Victorian]] movement of integrating real life and art.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=PAULY|first=THOMAS H.|date=1975|title=The Literary Sketch in Nineteenth-Century America|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/40754392|journal=Texas Studies in Literature and Language|volume=17|issue=2|pages=489–503|jstor=40754392|issn=0040-4691}}</ref> By blending fact and fiction, journalists could use their writing to explore their uncertainties and speculations about the subject.<ref name=":3" />

During the 19th century, vignettes were written by anonymous authors, and attributed to the newspaper or journal they featured in.<ref name=":3" /> They were reused for new audiences and were therefore being constantly revised and re-contextualised.<ref name=":3" />
[[File:Example of vignetting and dusty scan.jpg|thumb|An example of a vignette photograph, with blurred and darkened edges]]
Later in the 19th century, vignettes in newspapers declined in use and popularity.<ref name=":3" /> This was due to journalism becoming more realistic and fact based.<ref name=":3" /> The decline of vignettes also reflected a broader shift in society towards [[Scientific theory|scientific theories]] and [[Literary realism|realism]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Gershon|first=Livia|date=2019-08-06|title=The Invention of Journalistic Objectivity|url=https://daily.jstor.org/the-invention-of-journalistic-objectivity/|access-date=2020-11-02|website=JSTOR Daily|language=en-US}}</ref> Journalism and literature separated into different, distinct branches of writing, until literary journalism emerged in the late 19th century.<ref name=":3" />
[[File:Sketches by Boz - The Streets, Morning.jpg|thumb|''The Streets, Morning'', illustration by [[George Cruikshank]] for ''Sketches by Boz'' by [[Charles Dickens]].]]
Aside from journalism, vignettes in the form of the “[[Literary Sketch|literary sketch]]” became popularised in the Victorian era by authors such as [[William Makepeace Thackeray]] and [[Charles Dickens]], and their works would often appear in newspapers and magazines.<ref name=":7" /> Works such as [[Sketches by Boz]] by Charles Dickens, and Thackeray’s ''Vanity Fair: Pen and Pencil Sketches of English Society,'' drew heavily from the original definition of a sketch in the visual arts by creating a sense of spontaneity, freedom and authenticity.<ref name=":7" /> These sketches sometimes included visual illustrations by [[George Cruikshank]], and were viewed as rough drafts rather than complete works of literature - a necessary step towards creating a finished work, but not inferior to a finished work.<ref name=":7" /> The fragmentary and immediate style of these vignettes reflected the 19th century’s sense of economic and social instability, and the rapid pace of urban life.<ref name=":7" />

Dickens’ sketches often described brief and immediate scenes of everyday life.<ref name=":7" /> The sketches represented a smaller part of a larger story and conveyed themes relevant to the Victorian Era such as social class, work and money.<ref name=":7" />  The use of common themes across different vignettes provides each story with an additional dimension of depth.<ref>{{Cite web|title="Defining the Vignette" in "Classifying Vignettes, Modeling Hybridity" on Manifold @uminnpress|url=https://manifold.umn.edu/read/untitled-bd3eb0af-fdad-4dd6-9c94-3fd15d522ab6/section/759a4190-fdae-45c1-8960-29c8f4c19864|access-date=2021-06-03|website=Manifold @uminnpress|language=en-US}}</ref>

Due to the rise of [[Postmodern literature|post-modern]] and [[experimental literature]] after [[World War II|World War 2]], attributes of vignettes resurfaced in popularity. Post-modern literature rejects the conventional “novel” structure and notions of a chronological [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] and character development.<ref name=":8">{{Cite web|last=Mambrol|first=Nasrullah|date=2019-03-21|title=Postmodern Novels and Novelists|url=https://literariness.org/2019/03/21/postmodern-novels-and-novelists/|access-date=2020-11-02|website=Literary Theory and Criticism|language=en-US}}</ref> Techniques in postmodern literature such as minimalistic, “[[slice of life]]” stories and fragmentation became popular, which are also key characteristics of vignettes.<ref name=":8" /> Vignettes also emerged in other forms of media such as [[postmodern theatre]], which does not adhere to a fixed structure, style or genre.<ref name=":14">{{Cite web|title=Postmodern theatre - The Art and Popular Culture Encyclopedia|url=http://www.artandpopularculture.com/Postmodern_theater|access-date=2020-11-02|website=www.artandpopularculture.com}}</ref>

== Style ==
Vignettes are written in a brief, concise style. They are rich in [[imagery]] to create a vivid, detailed description of a moment in time and a character’s immediate experiences.<ref name=":0" />

While [[Short story|short stories]] and [[flash fiction]] are complete works that follow a [[narrative structure]] of beginning, middle and end, vignettes do not follow this traditional narrative structure.<ref name=":4" /> A vignette contains less action and plot structure than flash fiction, and instead focuses on vividly capturing a single scene or a brief slice-of life moment in a character's experience.<ref name=":1" /> Vignettes are short and tend to be under 1,000 words in length.<ref name=":4">{{Cite news|date=2020|title=What Is a Vignette In Literature?|work=MasterClass|url=https://www.masterclass.com/articles/what-is-a-vignette-in-literature-defining-the-literary-device-plus-5-tips-on-writing-vignettes#quiz-0}}</ref> A vignette contains less action and drama than [[flash fiction]], and places more emphasis on vividly capturing a single moment.<ref name=":1" />

As vignettes are often brief and do not allow for elaborate plot or character development, many writers craft vignettes to be part of a larger story or idea. For example, [[Sandra Cisneros|Sandra Cisneros’]] ''[[The House on Mango Street]]'' is the length of a novel but is a collection of individual vignettes.<ref name=":0" /> Each vignette explores common themes, motifs and characters that contribute to an overall plot.<ref name=":0" /> In [[Ernest Hemingway|Ernest Hemingway’s]] collection of short stories [[In Our Time (short story collection)|''In Our Time'']], individual vignettes integrate into an overarching narrative rather than acting as brief, isolated descriptions.<ref name=":9" /> [[Charles Dickens|Charles Dickens’]] collection of vignette sketches ''[[Sketches by Boz]]'', although not contributing to a broader plot, explore common themes relevant to the Victorian era such as social class, adding a sense of depth and continuity.<ref name=":7" />

Vignettes also appear in other creative forms such as web series, television shows, and films. For example, the web series ''[[High Maintenance]]'' uses vignettes to explore the lives of a different set of characters in each episode.<ref>{{Cite web|title=High Maintenance|url=https://ew.com/article/2013/04/10/high-maintenance-3/|access-date=2020-11-02|website=EW.com|language=EN}}</ref> This series uses the vignette style to vividly portray themes of the human condition, such as boredom and loneliness.<ref>{{Cite web|title=How to Stop Feeling Lonely, According to the Creators of 'High Maintenance'|url=https://www.vice.com/en/article/43zd9p/high-maintenance-creators-ben-sinclair-and-katja-blichfeld-hbo-how-to-stop-feeling-lonely|access-date=2020-11-02|website=www.vice.com|language=en}}</ref> Movies and television shows also use vignettes to reveal more details about the inner world and past lives of characters.<ref name=":4" /> The Netflix series ''[[Orange Is the New Black|Orange is the New Black]]'' uses flashbacks that act as vignettes to explore each character’s past in more vivid detail.<ref name=":4" /> The 2018 Western anthology film ''[[The Ballad of Buster Scruggs]]'' is composed of six short films that act as vignettes.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Dani Di Placido|title=The Six 'Ballad of Buster Scruggs' Shorts, Ranked|language=en|work=Forbes|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/danidiplacido/2018/11/19/the-six-ballad-of-buster-scruggs-shorts-ranked/?sh=5049843789a9|access-date=2020-11-20}}</ref> In the 1989 romantic comedy [[When Harry Met Sally...|''When Harry Met Sally'']], director [[Rob Reiner]] weaves the fictional plotline with real-life vignettes of elderly, married couples telling the stories of how they met.<ref>{{Citation|title=When Harry Met Sally... (1989) - IMDb|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098635/trivia|access-date=2020-11-18}}</ref>

Vignettes are also used in psychological research ''(see also: [[Vignette (psychology)]])''.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://gking.harvard.edu/vign/faq/What_issues_should.html|title=What issues should I consider when writing vignettes?|language=en}}</ref> In research, vignettes act as short descriptions about a hypothetical situation, to which survey participants respond with their perceptions, beliefs, attitudes, and how they would react to the given situation.<ref name=":13">{{Cite journal|last=Hughes|first=Rhidian|date=1998|title=Considering the Vignette Technique and its Application to a Study of Drug Injecting and HIV Risk and Safer Behaviour|journal=Sociology of Health & Illness|language=en|volume=20|issue=3|pages=381–400|doi=10.1111/1467-9566.00107|issn=1467-9566|doi-access=}}</ref> The wording of these vignette scenarios are experimentally controlled by the researcher, and different versions of the vignette may be randomly assigned to different participants.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/233969508|title=Encyclopedia of survey research methods|date=2008|publisher=SAGE Publications|others=Lavrakas, Paul J.|isbn=978-1-4522-6147-8|location=Thousand Oaks, Calif.|oclc=233969508}}</ref> These vignettes may be based on previous research findings, or based on real-life examples.<ref name=":13" /> A potential limitation of using vignettes in psychological research is that individuals may respond differently to these fictional scenarios than their real-life response.<ref name=":13" /> Vignettes can also be used to provide a fictional example of a psychological concept.<ref name=":13" /> Vignettes have primarily been used by North American psychologists and in surveys.<ref name=":13" />
