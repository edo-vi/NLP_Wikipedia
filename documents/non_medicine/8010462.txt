==Publications==

Originally published in 1971, and now in its third edition, Morris' ''Hunter Seat Equitation'' often is recognized as the definitive work on the subject.<ref name=":10" /> Morris also has authored several other books and videos on riding and judging. Live broadcasts of training sessions led by Morris are featured on the United States Equestrian Federation (USEF) network.<ref>
http://www.usefnetwork.com/GeorgeMorris2011/ United States Equestrian Federation network, the national governing body for equestrian sport</ref>

In 1989, Morris began contributing to the [[The Chronicle of the Horse|Chronicle of the Horse]] magazine's "Between Rounds" section.<ref name=":5" /> Morris also wrote a column in the monthly equestrian magazine [[Practical Horseman]], titled "Jumping Clinic," in which he critiqued the jumping form of riders in reader-submitted photographs.<ref name=":5" /> He wrote "Jumping Clinic" from 1977 until 2019, when showjumper [[Beezie Madden]] took over the column.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Oliynyk|first=Sandra|title=Beezie Madden Takes the Reins|url=https://practicalhorsemanmag.com/training/beezie-madden-takes-the-reins|access-date=2020-11-27|website=Expert how-to for English Riders|language=en}}</ref> He coined the term "drama riding" for the lack of classical position seen in riders in the show ring today.{{citation needed|date=July 2021}}
