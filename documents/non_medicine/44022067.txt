{{2014 Asian Games}}
A number of concerns and controversies surfaced before, during and after the [[2014 Asian Games]] in [[Incheon]], South Korea.

==Prior to the Games==

===Sponsorship and organization===
The Games were hit by lack of sponsorship and a lack of interest from the public with only 18% of the tickets for the opening ceremony sold a week before the Games. Sales of tickets for rhythmic gymnast [[Son Yeon-jae]] and badminton star [[Lee Yong-dae]]'s events were fast, while sales for the football competition were just seven percent and athletics eight percent.<ref>{{cite news|title=Debts and empty seats taint start of 2014 Asian Games at Incheon|url=http://www.thenational.ae/sport/debts-and-empty-seats-taint-start-of-2014-asian-games-at-incheon|access-date=27 September 2014|publisher=The National Sport|date=19 September 2014}}</ref> Organizers were able to generate more interest but there were a few hundred empty seats in the 61,000-capacity stadium at the start of the opening ceremony.<ref>{{cite news|title=Asian Games gets off to 'Gangnam Style' start

When the identity of the final torch bearer was revealed to be the actress [[Lee Young-ae]], there were mixed reactions in the local press as she had no direct ties to sports. However, she ultimately passed the torch to a pair of young South Korean athletes and the three lighted the cauldron in unison.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Jee-ho|first1=Yoo|title=(Asiad) Celebrity with no sports connection lights Asiad cauldron|url=http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/culturesports/2014/09/19/30/0701000000AEN20140919011000315F.html|access-date=4 October 2014|agency=Yonhap News Agency|date=19 September 2014}}</ref>

===Nationality issues===
In basketball, [[Olympic Council of Asia]]'s eligibility rule on naturalized players, which contradicted the eligibility rule set by [[FIBA]], became controversial as such rule disqualified [[Quincy Davis (basketball)|Quincy Davis]], a [[United States|US]]-born player playing for the Chinese Taipei team, and [[Andray Blatche]], a naturalized player of the Philippines, from participating in the tournament.<ref name="US-born">{{cite news|last1=Badua|first1=Shelley|title=US-born player no longer eligible for Asian Games|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2014/09/05/2003599061|access-date=7 September 2014|work=Taipei Times|date=5 September 2014}}</ref> In accordance with the rule, OCA also refused South Korea's request to include Aaron Haynes in the squad, an American veteran player in [[Korean Basketball League|Korea's basketball league]] who was in the process of naturalization.<ref name="US-born2">{{cite news|last1=Flojo|first1=Enzo|title=Previewing the Asian Games basketball qualifiers|url=http://www.rappler.com/sports/by-sport/basketball/69601-previewing-the-asian-games-basketball|access-date=20 September 2014|publisher=Rappler|date=19 September 2014}}</ref> Both OCA officials and IAGOC claimed that the OCA's eligibility rule requires a naturalized player to live minimum of three years in the country of his naturalization before becoming eligible to play for that country.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Pedralvez|first1=Manolo|title=SBP hints Gilas Asian Games boycott after OCA bars Blatche|url=http://www.rappler.com/sports/by-sport/basketball/gilas-pilipinas/68529-sbp-gilas-asian-games-boycott-blatche|access-date=20 September 2014|publisher=Rappler|date=8 September 2014}}</ref> Nevertheless, Chinese Taipei Basketball Association stated that it received the positive confirmation from OCA regarding the participation of Quincy Davis, which was suddenly overturned due to the fact that Davis was two months short from residing three full years in Chinese Taipei. Many basketball fans argued that the host nation South Korea brought up the regulation rule at the last minute in order to not allow enough time for its major opponents to reconstruct their squads. Meanwhile, South Korea claimed it was just enforcing the OCA's regulation and the South Korean team themselves were also negatively affected by the rule.<ref name="US-born"/><ref name="US-born2"/> Despite the request of FIBA to reconsider the enforcement of the eligibility rule, both OCA and the organizing committee upheld their decision.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Lagunzad|first1=Chris|title=FIBA backs Gilas for Andray Blatche's eligibility in the Asian Games|url=https://ph.sports.yahoo.com/news/fiba-backs-gilas-for-andray-blatche-s-eligibility-for-the-asian-games-070455242.html|access-date=20 September 2014|work=Taipei Times|date=6 September 2014}}</ref>

===Female participants and FIBA ban on hijab===
Saudi Arabia was the only participating NOC to not send female athletes to the Games despite international pressure from organizations including the [[Human Rights Watch]]. The country was accused of taking a step backwards from the [[2012 Summer Olympics]], the first time in Olympics history that Saudi Arabia lifted its ban on female participation.<ref name="guardian">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/jul/11/london-2012-saudi-arabia-female-athletes|title=London 2012: IOC in talks with Saudi Arabia over female athletes|work=The Guardian|access-date=3 October 2014|date=11 July 2012}}</ref> Mohammed al-Mishal, the secretary-general of Saudi Arabia's Olympic Committee, stated that women weren't included because none have reached the level for international competition.<ref>{{cite news|title=Saudi Arabia urged to end discrimination in women's sports|url=http://www.arabianbusiness.com/saudi-arabia-urged-end-discrimination-in-women-s-sports-566004.html|access-date=3 October 2014|work=Arabian Business|date=26 September 2014}}</ref> A member of the Saudi Olympic committee later stated that the country plans to send women to compete at the [[2016 Summer Olympics]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Asian Games: Women sidelined as Saudi Arabia selects all-male team|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-games-asian-saudi-women-idUSKBN0H31HI20140908|access-date=3 October 2014|work=Reuters|date=8 September 2014}}</ref>

Qatar women's basketball team was hit by FIBA ban on Muslim [[headscarf]], known as [[hijab]]. They were scheduled to play Mongolia but were disallowed. The team eventually withdrew from the tournament, refusing to remove the hijab.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Talmadge|first1=Eric|title=Qatar Women Withdraw Over Asian Games Hijab Ban|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/wireStory/qatar-forfeits-game-protest-hijab-ruling-25719857|access-date=25 September 2014|work=abc News|date=25 September 2014}}</ref> FIBA claimed the ban was made due to safety concerns.<ref>{{cite news|title=Hijab issue, drug controversies hit Asian Games|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/asiangames2014/story/380855/hijab-issue-drug-controversies-hit-asian-games|access-date=25 September 2014|publisher=GMA News|date=25 September 2014}}</ref> Qatar officials said the decision was insulting, disrespectful of the religion, and nonsensical as [[combat sports]] allow the hijab.<ref>{{cite news|agency=Agence France-Presse|title=Asian Games: Hijab Ban an Insult, Say Qatar Basketball Players|url=http://sports.ndtv.com/asian-games-2014/news/230452-asian-games-hijab-ban-an-insult-say-qatar-basketball-players|access-date=25 September 2014|publisher=NDTV Sports|date=25 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140930233126/http://sports.ndtv.com/asian-games-2014/news/230452-asian-games-hijab-ban-an-insult-say-qatar-basketball-players|archive-date=30 September 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> One player stated that they had been assured well before the Games that they would be able to wear hijab.<ref>{{cite news|title=Asian Games: Qatar women's team pull out over hijab ban|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/basketball/29342986|access-date=25 September 2014|work=BBC Sport|date=25 September 2014}}</ref>

===Cycling venue===
In cycling, Hong Kong cyclists had raised concerns after they found the competition venue would be an outdoor velodrome of 333 metres in length, instead of a 250 metres indoor velodrome, which is commonly in use during the [[Cycling at the Summer Olympics|Olympic Games]] and the [[UCI Track Cycling World Cup|World Cup]]. [[Hong Kong Cycling Association]] claimed that outdoor velodromes are rare in modern cycling and they have to travel far to practice in a similar environment.<ref>{{cite news|title=Hong Kong raise alarm over Asian Games old-style cycling track|url=http://www.scmp.com/sport/hong-kong/article/1458744/hong-kong-raise-alarm-over-asian-games-old-style-cycling-track|access-date=13 April 2014|newspaper=South China Morning Post|date=27 March 2014}}</ref> The organising committee denied any advantage to the host nation. They also claimed that the track was re-coated and received approval from [[Union Cycliste Internationale]] (UCI).<ref>{{cite news|last=Butler|first=Nick|title=Incheon 2014 unconcerned by criticism over track cycling venue at Asian Games|url=http://www.insidethegames.biz/major-games/asian-games/1019226-incheon-2014-unconcerned-by-criticism-over-track-cycling-venue-at-asian-games|access-date=13 April 2014|newspaper=inside the games|date=2 April 2014}}</ref>

== Opening ceremony programme ==
The [[2014 Asian Games opening ceremony]] was criticised by local media for featuring more celebrities and K-pop stars than sports figures, failing to display the legacy of the event or [[Incheon]] city's culture and abasing the sports stars' presence at the event. Despite executive director [[Jang Jin]]'s promise that the main characters ― [[Jang Dong-gun]] and [[Kim Soo-hyun]] would have the roles of storytellers, their presence was overshadowed by the performances of boy band [[JYJ]] and singer [[Psy]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/nation/2019/06/660_180148.html|title=Gwangju opening show may become another K-pop concert|work=The Korea Times|date=3 July 2015|author=Nam Hyun-woo}}</ref>

==Competition issues==

===Women's 10 meter air-rifle===

The Chinese team was initially disqualified after shooter Zhang Binbin was found to have violated regulations concerning maximum weight limits of her rifle. The disqualification was eventually reversed after a strong appeal by Chinese officials arguing that Zhang "didn't intend to break the rule". This allowed China to retain their team gold and a new world record.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Oh|first1=Seok-min|title=(Asiad) China gets world record back in women's 10ｍ air rifle after ruling reversal|url=http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/yonhap-news-agency/140922/asiad-china-gets-world-record-back-womens-10-air-rifle-aft-0|access-date=22 September 2014|agency=Yonhap News Agency|date=22 September 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Rutherford|first1=Peter|title=China shooters DQ'd, reinstated, set world record|url=http://in.reuters.com/article/games-asian-shooting-idINKCN0HH0RA20140922|access-date=22 September 2014|work=Reuters|date=22 September 2014}}</ref> This led to a series of allegations that members of jury favoured Zhang.<ref>{{cite news|title=Judoka Jeong defends Asiad title|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/sports/2014/09/207_165023.html|access-date=23 September 2014|work=The Korea Times|date=22 September 2014}}</ref>

===Badminton===

In badminton, Chinese coach [[Li Yongbo]] accused the hosts of manipulating the wind in the stadium, after China was defeated by South Korea in the final of the men's team event. Yongbo said, "We did not lose because of technique or tactics, but due to some man-made reasons. The South Koreans deliberately controlled the wind blow in the stadium and took advantage of it." Japanese coach [[Keita Masuda]] also alleged a similar case saying, "The wind in this stadium is very strange, always supporting the hosts. Every time we change sides, the wind seems to change sides as well."<ref>{{cite news|last1=Noel Cudaihl|first1=Justin|title=2014 Asian Games Results Tainted By Rampant Cheating Allegations Hurled Against Hosts South Korea|url=http://au.ibtimes.com/articles/568500/20141003/asian-games-korea-cheating-boxing-badminton-football.htm|access-date=3 October 2014|work=International Business Times|date=3 October 2014}}</ref> Thailand's [[Ratchanok Intanon]], a former world champion, also went on to blame the "strangely strong winds" for her defeat in the quarterfinals of the women's singles event against a South Korean opponent.<ref name=thenation>{{cite news|title=A host country's sporting bias is fool's gold|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/opinion/A-host-countrys-sporting-bias-is-fools-gold-30244556.html|access-date=3 October 2014|work=The Nation|date=2 October 2014}}</ref>

===Boxing officiating===
Indian lightweight boxer [[Laishram Sarita Devi]] lost a highly controversial 60&nbsp;kg semi-final bout against eventual silver medalist Park Jina of South Korea. Despite what many believed was a better performance by Sarita Devi, all three ringside judges ruled in favor of her opponent, leading to a 0–3 decision. The ringside judges were Braham Mohamad of Tunisia, Albino Foti of Italy, and Mariusz Josef Gorny of Poland.<ref>{{cite news|title=Mary Kom in final, Sarita Devi robbed of win at Asian Games|url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2014-09-30/news/54475143_1_asian-games-l-sarita-devi-incheon|access-date=1 October 2014|work=The Economic Times|date=30 September 2014}}</ref> The decision, which drew huge criticism, left Sarita Devi in a state of shock and she was seen weeping inconsolably.<ref>{{cite news|title=Asian Games: Boxer Sarita Devi refuses bronze after controversial decision|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/boxer-sarita-devi-refuses-asian-games-bronze-after-controversial-decision/1/393674.html|access-date=4 October 2014|work=India Today|date=1 October 2014}}</ref> [[Indian Olympic Association]] (IOA) office-bearers chose not to involve themselves with the situation, leaving Sarita Devi and her husband Thoiba Singh to lodge the protests by themselves.<ref>{{cite news|title=Shameful: Sarita borrows appeal money from journalist as IOA officials sneak out|url=http://www.firstpost.com/sports/shameful-sarita-borrows-appeal-money-journalist-ioa-officials-sneak-away-1738345.html|access-date=1 October 2014|publisher=F.Sports|date=1 October 2014}}</ref> They were unable to pay the [[United States dollar|USD$]]500 fee to lodge an official protest against [[International Boxing Association (amateur)|AIBA]] until Sarita's coach Lenin Meitei and an Indian journalist paid the amount on their behalf.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Vasavda|first1=Mihir|title=Asian Games 2014: As Sarita Devi borrows to pay $500 as fee for lodging protest, IOA officials look other way|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/sports/sport-others/as-sarita-borrows-to-pay-500-as-fee-for-lodging-protest-ioa-officials-look-other-way/|access-date=1 October 2014|publisher=The India Express|date=1 October 2014}}</ref> Sarita Devi stunned officials and spectators by refusing to accept the bronze medal during the medal ceremony.<ref>{{cite news|title=Asian Games 2014: Boxer L Sarita Devi refuses to accept bronze medal; Sports Ministry to seek report from IOA|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/sport/report-asian-games-2014-boxer-l-sarita-devi-refuses-to-accept-bronze-medal-sports-ministry-to-seek-report-from-ioa-2022841|access-date=1 October 2014|agency=Zee Media Bureau/PTI|publisher=dna|date=1 October 2014}}</ref> Devi initially took her bronze medal and placed it around Park Jina's neck.

Shortly after Sarita Devi's controversial loss, Mongolian boxer [[Nyambayaryn Tögstsogt]] lost a controversial bout against South Korean Ham Sang-myeong in the 56&nbsp;kg category. Nyambayar stayed in the ring for 5 minutes, protesting the results.

===Men's football===
[[Worawi Makudi]], the president of [[Football Association of Thailand]], criticized the referees for making mistakes during the semi-final match between South Korea and Thailand. Coach [[Kiatisuk Senamuang]] voiced displeasure about the penalty kick awarded to South Korea following a foul outside the penalty area, which directly led to its second goal at the 45+1' minute mark.<ref>{{cite web|title=Football – Men's Semifinal 1 |url=http://www.incheon2014ag.org/Sports/FB/Result?RSC=FBM400201&lang=en |website=Incheon2014ag.org |access-date=4 October 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141002082944/http://www.incheon2014ag.org/Sports/FB/Result?RSC=FBM400201&lang=en |archive-date= 2 October 2014 }}</ref> Controversy continued as a South Korean defender used his arm to block the movement of the ball twice inside South Korea's penalty area.

===Alleged misbehaviour of athletes===
The organiser claimed that the misbehaviour of some of the athletes such as smoking and causing damage to property during the competition resulted in the Malaysian delegation being fined RM143,000 (US$40,000).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.insidethegames.biz/articles/1027405/malaysian-athletes-hit-with-40000-fine-for-damage-caused-during-asian-games|title=Malaysian athletes hit with $40,000 fine for damage caused during Asian Games|agency=[[Inside The Games]]|date=18 May 2015}}</ref> Sepak takraw, along with bowling, sailing and rugby sevens were among the sports in which athletes incurred fines.
