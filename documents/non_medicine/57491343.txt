{{Short description|East Asian historiographic dispute}}
The '''Balhae controversies''' involve disputes between [[China]], [[Korea]], [[Japan]], and [[Russia]], countries that have conducted studies on the historical state of [[Balhae]] (Bohai, Po-hai, Parhae). The Korean perspective generally considers Balhae to be the successor state of [[Goguryeo]] and part of the [[Northern and Southern States period]] of Korean history, while Chinese scholars generally consider Balhae to be a state of the [[Mohe people]], a [[Tungusic peoples|Tungusic]] ethnic group, and subordinate to the [[Tang dynasty]] (618––907).<ref>冯海英, 肖莉杰, 霍学雷. 20世纪90年代以来中国学者对渤海国民族与政权的研究. 东北史地, 2008(6).</ref><ref name="Kim2012">{{cite book|author=Jinwung Kim|title=A History of Korea: From "Land of the Morning Calm" to States in Conflict|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s2EVi-MpnUsC&pg=PA85|year=2012|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=978-0-253-00024-8|page=85}}</ref> In Russian historiography, Balhae is recognized as the first highly-organized independent state formation of the Tungus-Manchurian peoples.<ref name="ШАВКУНОВ Эрнест Владимирович">{{Cite web|url=http://www.rauk.ru/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1533:2014-10-19-15-51-44&catid=126:2011-04-02+19:33:16&lang=en&Itemid=143|title=RAUK|website=www.rauk.ru|accessdate=16 March 2023}}</ref>

==Background==
Balhae (698-926) is a kingdom that has been studied and debated in [[East Asia]] since the early 20th century. Central to the issue of scholarship since the 1960s is whether or not Balhae belongs to Korean or Chinese national history. Arguments based on the identity and essential features of Balhae have been made by contemporary states to confirm or question territorial claims by present governments. Academic disputes over the identity of Goguryeo and Balhae are commonly linked to claims in international relations discourse on the legitimacy of the present Sino-Korean border.{{sfn|Sloane|2014|p=2-3}}

The general positions of state actors involved in the Balhae dispute:

Koreas:
*Balhae was a "Korean" state founded by the descendants of Goguryeo and that Balhae and Unified Silla constituted the "Northern and Southern Dynasties".{{sfn|Sloane|2014|p=4}}

China:
*Balhae was a local polity founded by the "Mohe nationality", subordinate to the Tang dynasty.{{sfn|Sloane|2014|p=4}}

Soviet Union/Russia:
*Balhae was created by a union of Mohe peoples who are the ancestors of tribal groups in Russian territory.{{sfn|Sloane|2014|p=4}}

Empire of Japan:
*Balhae was founded by a Sumo Mohe tribal leader with no connection to Goguryeo or Korea, and was independent from the Tang dynasty.{{sfn|Sloane|2014|p=7-8}}

===Origin===
[[Goryeo]] (918–1392) did not write an official history for Balhae, and some modern scholars argue that had they done so, Koreans might have had a stronger claim to Balhae's history and territory.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A9LoA9L1ABcC&pg=PA188 |title=Sources of Korean Tradition: from the sixteenth to the twentieth centuries - Google Books |date=2001-02-14|isbn=9780231518000 |last1=Lee |first1=Peter H. |last2=Ch'Oe |first2=Yongho }}</ref> This was in part because the writer of Korea's first historical record, the [[Samguk Sagi]], was [[Kim Bu-sik]] (1075-1151), who was a direct descendent of the ruling Silla dynasty.

Some scholars, such as [[Bak Jiwon (born 1737)|Bak Jiwon]] (1737–1805), denied the fact that the [[Han dynasty]]'s territories extended south of the [[Yalu River]], and criticized [[Kim Bu-sik]] (1075–1151), the author of the ''[[Samguk Sagi]]'', for excluding [[Balhae]] (''Bohai'' in Chinese) in Manchuria from the history of Korea, arguing that the people of Balhae were "descendants" of Goguryeo.

===Modern scholars===
[[North Korea]]n scholars—and more recently, some in the [[South Korea|South]]—have recently tried to incorporate Balhae history as an integral part of Korean history by challenging the view of [[Unified Silla]] (668–935) as the unification of Korea. According to this narrative, [[Goryeo]] was the first unification of Korea, since Balhae still existed while occupying former Goguryeo territory north of the Korean peninsula.<ref name="Choe"/> In the 1960s, the North Korean scholar [[Pak Se-yong]] advanced arguments that claimed Balhae as "a part of Korean history."{{sfn|Sloane|2014a|p=5}} Central to the argument was Balhae's place as "a state founded by people of Koguryŏ" and its territory as "composed of most of the "former territory of Koguryŏ and an expansive, newly-acquired portion."{{sfn|Sloane|2014a|p=5}} Pak made broader claims on the continuity of Balhae with modern Korea, contending that "bloodline and culture are an important component of the bloodlines and cultural traditions of the Korean race."{{sfn|Sloane|2014a|p=5}}

In South Korea, Chu Yŏnghŏn advocated a Korean identity for Balhae based on findings of joint Chinese-North Korean archaeological excavations in the 1960s. These efforts led to the incorporation of Balhae into Korean history as part of the "Northern and Southern Dynasties" based on instances in which the Silla court referred to Balhae as the "northern court."{{sfn|Sloane|2014a|p=5}} Acceptance of this new narrative was not immediate. In 1981, a South Korean scholar called the Northern-Southern Dynasties an "interesting new interpretation"{{sfn|Sloane|2014a|p=6}} and as late as 1990, there was still no consensus. However, by now the Northern-Southern Dynasties paradigm is widely accepted in South Korean academia. According to Kim Eun Gug, the adoption of this position was necessary to counter Chinese claims on Goguryeo and Balhae as part of Chinese history as well as to provide a model for North and South Korea's unification. Kim openly declared that, "We have a national responsibility to develop a response to China’s [[Northeast Project of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences|Northeast Project]] and its claims that Koguryŏ and Parhae belong to Chinese history."{{sfn|Sloane|2014a|p=4-6}}

Some Japanese scholarship from the mid-1930s to the early postwar period also supported placing Balhae within Korean history. This position was advanced mostly prominently by Mikami Tsugio and became very popular after Japan severed diplomatic ties with the People's Republic of China in 1949. In the 1980s, Japanese scholars scrutinized new archaeological evidence from China in the hopes of clarifying Balhae's ethnic identity. However, since then, the majority of Japanese scholars have moved away from seeking a singular ethnic paradigm for Balhae and instead focus on local government mechanisms and their relationship with central authority. According to Park Jin Suk, Japan no longer has any territorial interests in Balhae and its scholars offer a more objective position.{{sfn|Sloane|2014a|p=7-8}}

===Jurchens and Manchus===
Historically, the [[Jurchen people|Jurchens]] (later renamed the [[Manchu people|Manchus]]), believed they shared ancestry with the Mohe. According to the ''[[History of Jin]]'', the history of the Jurchen-led [[Jin dynasty, 1115–1234|Jin dynasty]] (1115–1234), the Jin founder [[Emperor Taizu of Jin]] once sent ambassadors to Bohai people living in the [[Liao dynasty]] (916–1125) to convince them to rebel against the Liao. He claimed that "the Jurchens and Bohai were originally of the same family" (女直渤海本同一家) and that they were "actually one family, because in origin they were consisted of seven Wuji tribes."{{sfn|Kim|2011b|p=173}}<ref>''[[History of Jin]]'', chapter 1, p. 25 of the Beijing [[Zhonghua Book Company|Zhonghua shuju]] edition.</ref><ref>

Archaeological materials from the Anan'evskoe site show material evidence of ancestral relations between the Jurchens and Bohai people. Several South Korean scholars believe that after Bohai's destruction in 926, Bohai's population was divided into two groups. Influential Bohai families were sent to the inner part of the Liao dynasty and were referred to as Bohai people, while those who remained under indirect management were called Jurchen. Han Ciu-cheol argues that Jurchens could be considered part of Korean history. Soviet and Russian scholars agree there were hereditary relationships between Mohe and Jurchen and that the Bohai population certainly contributed culturally to the ethnogenesis of the Jurchen. However, some differences remain. The Balhae refugee population was received well in Goryeo while they had a combative relationship with the Jurchens. Goryeo once massacred the ambassador and leaders of a Jurchen delegation during peace talks. They sent an official complaint about the Jurchens to the [[Song dynasty]], calling them greedy liars and other insulting names. The Jurchens described Goryeo people as enemies and often came into military conflict with them.{{sfn|Kim|2011b|p=171-172}} The Jurchen and Bohai people also differed in their level of technological and societal sophistication. Chinese sources describe the Jurchens as lacking law, governors, kings, or dignitaries. Prior to the reign of [[Wanyan Wugunai]] (1021–1074), in the early 11th century, the Jurchens could not produce iron armor and had to trade for it from other tribes.{{sfn|Kim|2011b|p=173}}

In 1778, the [[Qianlong Emperor]] of the [[Qing dynasty]] reviewed various history books and commissioned a new comprehensive history of the [[Manchus]], the ''[[Researches on Manchu Origins]]'' ({{manchu|m={{ManchuSibeUnicode|ᠮᠠᠨᠵᡠᠰᠠᡳ<br />ᡩᠠ<br />ᠰᡝᡴᡳᠶᡝᠨ {{zwj}}‍ᡳ<br />ᡴᡳᠮᠴᡳᠨ<br />ᠪᡳᡨᡥᡝ}}|v=Manjusai da sekiyen-i kimcin bithe|a=Manjusai da sekiyen-i kimqin bithe}}; {{zh|t=滿洲源流考|p=Mǎnzhōu Yuánliú Kǎo}}). Part of this endeavor was to create a new imperial history of Manchus that was glorious in its own right and not a frontier imitation of Chinese civilization. This new history placed their Jin ancestors, the Jin imperial clan, among the population of the Mohe, who lived in the [[Changbai Mountains]] and along the [[Amur]].{{sfn|Crossley|2002|p=20}} Qianlong repeatedly made references to the Bohai as the origin of various organizational features such as the use of "the five-capitals, a writing system, and a leadership hierarchy that he believed was evident in early Qing history and still in use among Northeastern peoples."{{sfn|Crossley|2016|p=11}}

Finnish linguist [[Juha Janhunen]] argues that it is possible that the Goguryeo language could have been an Amuric language related to today's [[Nivkh language]] isolate.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=LbmP_1KIQ_8C&pg=PA109 Pozzi & Janhunen & Weiers 2006], p. 109</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Janhunen|first1=Juha|title=The Lost Languages of Koguryo|journal=Journal of Inner and East Asian Studies|date=2005|volume=2-2|pages=65–86}}</ref>

===People's Republic of China===
Since 1949, the People's Republic of China has depicted the country as a multi-ethnic state and endeavored to create unity among the country's various minorities to strengthen the nation as a unified construct. According to this narrative, Chinese scholarship has generally characterized Bohai as a "local polity of a minority nationality" subordinate to Tang rule and that the history of Bohai belongs to China.{{sfn|Sloane|2014a|p=6}} Only in the 1980s did the study of the Bohai become a major enterprise in China. In the mid-2000s, Bohai studies received a new impetus from the Northeast Project. The project was seen by South Korean scholars as a concerted political effort to "contest the role of Koguryŏ and Parhae" as part of Korean history. There was concern that China would seek recognition from [[UNESCO]]. Park Jin Suk argues that "the Chinese position has been solidified" by the Northeast Project and now presents a united front against other historical interpretations.{{sfn|Sloane|2014a|p=6-7}} Although a standard Chinese position never actually developed and contradictions within Chinese scholars remain, there are no Chinese authors advocating Bohai as Korean.{{sfn|Sloane|2014a|p=7}}

Chinese research was described as focusing "solely on the relationship between Parhae and Tang, leading to the conclusion that Parhae was only a local government dependent in every respect on Tang."{{sfn|Sloane|2014a|p=13}} Such an assessment is no longer entirely true as Chinese scholarship now pays more attention to Bohai's relationship with other polities. A recent Chinese introduction to the topic categorized Bohai's diplomatic exchanges with the Tang as a "relationship between cultures" while other diplomatic actions were "foreign relations".{{sfn|Sloane|2014a|p=14}} According to Lei Yijie, Bohai was a "local ethnic polity" ruled by the Tang.{{sfn|Sloane|2014a|p=14}} Kaneko Shūichi notes that the Tang treated Bohai and Silla the same. Formally, they were "prefectures under loose rule" (''jimizhou''). In 713, the Tang court granted Da Zuorong the post of Commander-in-Chief (''dudu'') of Huhan Prefecture, the Tang name for Bohai's capital.{{sfn|Sloane|2014a|p=14}}<ref>''[[Old Book of Tang]]'', [[:zh:s:舊唐書/卷199下|vol. 199, part 2]].</ref> In practice, it is hard for Chinese dynasties to claim any state as independent under the "tribute model." This problem is exhibited by states such as Silla, Goryeo, and Joseon, all of which had less political autonomy than Bohai but are not claimed as Chinese.{{sfn|Sloane|2014a|p=15}} Epigraphic evidence shows that the rulers of Bohai considered themselves emperors and empresses. In communications between Bohai and the Japanese court, Bohai's ruler referred to himself as "Grandson of Heaven" and portrayed the relationship between himself and the ruler of Japan as uncle to nephew. Sakayori Masashi believes this was meant to express his superiority in a "Sinocentric worldview" centered on Bohai and to claim sovereignty over Silla and the Mohe tribes.{{sfn|Sloane|2014a|p=15}}

An earlier, opposing view comes from Chinese Prime Minister [[Zhou Enlai]], who said in 1963 that Korean people have lived in the northeastern region of China since ancient times and excavated relics prove that Bohai is a branch of ancient Korea. The former Chinese premier's remarks have been made public through a document entitled “Premier Zhou Enlai's Dialogue on Sino-Korean Relations.“<ref>周恩来总理谈中朝关系（摘自《外事工作通报》1963年第十期）1963年6月28日，周恩来总理接见朝鲜科学院代表团时，谈中朝关系 “朝鲜民族进驻朝鲜半岛和东北大陆以来，长期生活在那里。这是发掘于辽河和松花江流域及图们江和鸭绿江流域的许多遗物和碑文等史料所证明的，在许多朝鲜文献中也遗留了那些历史痕迹。”, “镜泊湖附近留有渤海遗迹，曾是渤海的首府。在这里出土的文物也证明那里也曾是朝鲜民族的一个支派。”</ref>

===Historical sites===
China is accused of limiting Korean archaeologists access to historical sites located within [[Liaoning]] and [[Jilin]]. Starting from 1994, increasing numbers of South Korean tourists began to visit [[Goguryeo]] archaeological sites in China and often engaged in nationalistic displays. China perceived this as a threat and restricted foreign access to Goguryeo sites. This perception was aggravated by a series of tomb robberies and vandalism at several of these archaeological sites between 1995 and 2000.<ref>{{Cite web| author=Mark Byington | title=The War of Words Between South Korea and China Over An Ancient Kingdom: Why Both Sides Are Misguided | year=2004 | work = History News Network | url=http://hnn.us/articles/7077.html }}</ref> [[South Korea]]n archeologist Song Ki-ho, a noted professor at [[Seoul National University]] who has published several papers criticizing the Chinese government's interpretation of [[Balhae|Bohai]] 's history, made several visits to China in the 1990s, 2000, 2003, and 2004, examining several historical sites and museums.

==Balhae as Manchurian==
The placement of Balhae within [[Manchuria]]n history was advanced by Japanese scholarship as their political and military interests grew after the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] in 1895. The Manchurian framework emphasized the distinctiveness of Balhae culture compared to Tang China, Goguryeo, and Silla. The Japanese archaeologist Komai Kazuchika led the excavation of Balhae's [[Shangjing Longquanfu|Supreme Capital]] in 1933–1934.

According to Associate Professor Ph.D. Kim Alexander from Vladivostok State University <ref>https://portfolio.vvsu.ru/education/tid/11414/</ref> Bohai studies were not left outside the politically-driven polemics during the era of the [[Sino-Soviet split]]. Soviet scholars wrote extensively about the war between the Tang Empire and the state of Bohai, paying great attention to the victories of the Bohai forces and emphasizing the independence of the state, while at the same time trying to downplay the results of the war, which made Bohai re-confirm its inferior position vis-a-vis the Tang Empire in the tributary system.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal |last=Kim |first=Alexander Alexeyvich |date=2008 |title=Archeological Studies of Bohai in Russia |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/24048057 |journal=Oriens Extremus |volume=47 |pages=302–312 |jstor=24048057 |issn=0030-5197}}</ref>

Russian Archeologists found in the area an Abbasid drachma from Central Asia which may indicate an economy in which foreign currency may have been used. The archeologists laid stress on the argument that the absence of an independently developed coinage is not sufficient evidence to deny that the Bohai state existed as an independent state.<ref name=":0" />

Alexander L'vovich Ivliev stresses that Bohai students are mentioned in Chinese sources (e.g. [[New Book of Tang]]) to have sat for the bingongke (賓貢科) exam, indicating that for the Tang officials, the students were subjects of other states as opposed to subjects of the Tang realm.<ref name=":0" /><ref>{{Cite book |last=V. |first=Shavkunov, Ė. |url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/645770174 |title=Gosudarstvo Bokhaĭ i pami︠a︡tniki ego kulʹtury v Primorʹe |date=1968 |publisher=Izd-vo "Nauka, " Leningradskoe otd-nie |oclc=645770174}}</ref>

Also, on the basis of archaeological documentary material (credential tag of the [[Tang Empire]]), it was established that the Teli people were not part of Bohai in 795.

==Subjects of contention==
===Ethnicity===
The ethnicity of Balhae's population is the most widely debated topic in the debate over its historical identity. The generally held position by most scholars is that Balhae society was separated into two ethnic components: descendants of Goguryeo and Mohe tribal groups. However, within this paradigm exists a number of different views on the relationship of the two groups.{{sfn|Sloane|2014a|p=9}}

Korean scholarship and history textbooks teach that "the ruling class of Parhae were persons of Koguryŏ origins and that the people over whom they ruled were the Malgal, a people whose ethnic origins were different from Koguryŏ."{{sfn|Sloane|2014|p=9}} This Korean framework portrays Balhae as a country, state, and government founded and dominated by Goguryeo people, an ethnic group equivalent to modern Koreans. The ethnic identity of the rulers is the overriding identity marker of Balhae, placing it within Korean history. Chŏn Hoch’ŏn characterizes Balhae and the peninsular Korean state of Silla as possessing "the same ethnicity."{{sfn|Sloane|2014|p=9}} Song Ki-ho and No T'aedon argue that the Mohe were Tungusic people who had been assimilated into Goguryeo and Balhae, thereby making Mohe part of Korean history.{{sfn|Kim|2015|p=12}}{{sfn|Sloane|2014a|p=11}} A few scholars in Korea, such as Han Ciu-cheol, argue that there was no difference between the Goguryeo and Mohe population and that they were the same ethnicity. Mohe was used as a pejorative term for the lower class. In the same vein, Jang Guk-jong argues that Mohe tribes in Balhae were not Mohe but part of Goguryeo's provincial population.{{sfn|Kim|2015|p=12}}{{sfn|Sloane|2014a|p=10}}

In China, the Mohe are generally considered the "main ethnicity" while Goguryeo descendants occupy a secondary minority position. Based on the ''New Book of Tang'', Chinese scholars argue that Balhae's founders were from the Sumo Mohe tribe centered on the [[Songhua River]].{{sfn|Sloane|2014a|p=9-10}}

In 1915, Tsuda Sōkichi noted that Tang sources describe the Baishan Mohe as more closely allied to Goguryeo while the Sumo were actually in conflict with Goguryeo. Li Jiancai argues that based on this finding, the founder of Balhae, [[Dae Joyeong]] or Da Zuorong, was more likely to have been from the Baishan tribe. This position has been adopted by a number of Chinese scholars but remains marginal. Another marginal position presented by Sun Jinji argues that Balhae was not just Mohe but that diverse groups merged to form a Balhae ethnicity. This is directly opposed by Yun Jae-Woon, who points out separate activities by Mohe and Jurchen groups after the fall of Balhae, which demonstrate that they had not been absorbed into Balhae. However, Jesse D. Sloane notes that this does not mean a new ethnicity did not form as well, while not everyone were absorbed into it.{{sfn|Sloane|2014a|p=9-10}}

Russian scholars argue that the ethnic composition of Balhae cannot be determined with great precision because no materials exist that can confirm either the Chinese or Korean claims. Some Russian scholars claim Balhae as part of Manchurian history while others believe Balhae was neither a Korean state nor a Chinese province and there is no direct link between Balhae and either modern China or Korea.{{sfn|Kim|2011|p=299}} E. V. Shakunov believes that Balhae's population also consisted of elements from [[Central Asia]] such as [[Sogdians]] and [[Tocharians]]. Many [[Uyghurs]] fled to Balhae after the destruction of the [[Uyghur Khaganate]] in 840 but they failed to adapt to Balhae society and caused social unrest.{{sfn|Kim|2015|p=10-11}}

====Population change====
Besides the territorial aspirations of both Korean nationalists and those of Joseon rulers during the mid-late period of the Joseon dynasty, Korean claims to Balhae also rest on ethnicity as well as East Asian concepts of state succession. When Balhae was destroyed by the [[Liao dynasty]], a great portion of the Balhae royalty and aristocracy fled to Goryeo, including [[Dae Gwang-hyeon]], the last [[crown prince]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=이상각|script-title=ko:고려사 - 열정과 자존의 오백년|date=2014|publisher=들녘|isbn=9791159250248|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LonnCgAAQBAJ&pg=PT25|access-date=23 March 2018|language=ko}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=(2) 건국―호족들과의 제휴|url=http://contents.history.go.kr/front/nh/view.do?levelId=nh_011_0040_0030_0020_0020|website=우리역사넷|publisher=National Institute of Korean History|access-date=23 March 2018|language=ko}}</ref> They were granted land and the crown prince was given the family name Wang (왕, 王), the royal family name of the Goryeo dynasty, and were included in the royal household by [[Wang Geon]], who was crowned as Taejo of Goryeo.

[[Pamela Kyle Crossley|Crossley]] believes that according to Goryeo records, Balhae refugees only arrived in groups of a few hundred to a few thousand. She suggests that the total number could not be more than 100,000, while millions remained in Liao-controlled territories. According to Crossley, it's also unclear whether they stayed, went back to Balhae, or moved on elsewhere like China or Japan.{{sfn|Crossley|2016|p=28}} According to Kim, between the 10th and 11th centuries, 30,000 Balhae families (more than 100,000 people) immigrated to Goryeo, 94,000 (470,000 inhabitants) local families were deported by the Liao, and only 20,000 Balhae families lived in the former territories of Balhae, a significantly smaller figure than those that immigrated to Goryeo.{{sfn|Kim|2019|p=108, 110}} Korean historians generally estimate that approximately 100,000 to 200,000 fled from Balhae to Goryeo.<ref>{{cite book |last1=김 |first1=위현 |title=渤海遺民의 再建運動 : 後渤海와 大渤海}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=나 |first1=영남 |title=《요·금시대 이민족 지배와 발해인》. 외대 역사문화 연구총서 |date=2017 |publisher=History and Culture Research Series at the University of Foreign Studies}}</ref> Historian Professor Park Jong-gi estimated that 120,600 people fled from Balhae to Goryeo, and by themselves, comprised approximately 6.3% of early Goryeo's roughly 2 million inhabitants.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Lee |first1=Sang-Do |title=[평화칼럼] 발해 유민(遺民)과 꼬마 난민(難民) '쿠르디' |url=http://m.cpbc.co.kr/paper/view.php?cid=598022&path=201510 |website=Catholic Peace Newspaper |access-date=8 February 2023}}</ref>

===Textual sources===
{{quotation|The problem about Parhae history is that many questions are beyond a simple answer. Different, nearly contemporary, sources represent fundamental questions in very different ways with different possible interpretations.{{sfn|Reckel|2015|p=481-482}}|Johannes Reckel}}

====Chinese====
While the study of Balhae draws on a wide range of textual sources, most investigations of its ethnicity start from the two official histories of the Tang dynasty.{{sfn|Sloane|2014a|p=11}} Efforts have been made to seek evidence in other texts but works by Balhae authors are extremely scarce.{{sfn|Sloane|2014a|p=13}}

According to the ''[[Old Book of Tang]]'', the founder of Balhae, Da Zuorong or Dae Joyeong, was a Mohe but adds that he was ''gaoli biezhong'' (高麗別種).{{sfn|Sloane|2014a|p=12}}<ref name="Link">''[[Old Book of Tang]]'', Original: 渤海靺鞨大祚榮者，本高麗別種也.

In the [Tang] Wansui Tongtian 萬歲通天 period [696–697], the Khitan Li Jinzhong 李盡忠 rebelled, and Zuorong and the Mohe Qisi Biyu 乞四比羽 each led a group of refugees fleeing east, fortifying an inaccessible position for self-protection. Once Li Jinzhong had died, [Empress Wu] Zetian 武則天 ordered Li Kaigu 李楷固 [d.u.], Great General of the Right Guards of the Jade Strategy, to lead troops in an attack on [Li Jinzhong’s] remaining followers.

According to Han Ciu-cheol, the ''Old Book'' states that the customs of the Balhae, such as coming of age ceremonies, marriages, funerals, and memorial rites, were the same as with the Goguryeo, which Korean historians often cite to support their arguments.<ref name="auto3">{{cite book |last1=Han |first1= Ciu-cheol |chapter=The Ethnic Composition of Parhae’s Population|title=A New History of Parhae |date=2012 |publisher=Brill |page=22}}</ref> According to Kim Eun Gug, the ''Old Book'' indicates that the Tang court bestowed [[Mu of Balhae]] the title of “King of Kyeru Commandery," which is significant because Kyeru (Gyeru) was the name that was used to denote old Goguryeo territory.

According to Sloane, Tang sources divided Balhae's population into two categories, Goguryeo and Mohe. The royalty and upper class were composed of Goguryeo remnants while the majority of Balhae's population were Mohe.{{sfn|Sloane|2014|p=366-367}}

According to [[Choe Chiwon]] (b. 857), who was from Silla, the people of Balhae were Mohe.{{sfn|Kim|2011|p=293}} In the conflict between the joint Tang-Silla forces against Balhae, Silla described Balhae as "rebellious barbarians."{{sfn|Kim|2011a|p=351}} Sillan aristocracy tended to view the Balhae population as consisting of solely Mohe people, but this could be due to the antagonistic relations between the two states causing the Sillan nobility to ignore Goguryeo elements of Balhae ethnic composition.{{sfn|Kim|2015|p=8}}

====Japanese====
The ''[[Ruijū Kokushi]]'', a 9th-century Japanese text, says that when Balhae was founded, it spanned 2,000 ''li'' and was filled with villages, each of which were Mohe tribes.<ref><類聚国史>卷一九三记载:天皇二年(698年),大祚荣始建渤海国,其国延袤二千里,无州县馆驿,处处有村里,皆靺鞨部落。其百姓者 靺鞨多,土人少,皆以土人为村长.</ref>{{sfn|Kim|2011|p=292}}

According to Pak Se-yong, the "natives" in the passage refer to people of Goguryeo, and therefore, all officials in the local and central government were Koguryŏ aristocrats. This has been challenged by Han Ciu-cheol, who argues that the term for "native" (J. ''dojin'' 土人) should be read as "literati" (J. ''shijin'' 士人) instead. The resulting translation would therefore be: "Everywhere there were villages and those villages were all Malgal settlements.

However, Han's position is opposed by Fu Langyun, who argues that ''dojin'' does not refer to either Mohe or Goguryeo people but rather, a separate group of native inhabitants, while Yang Jun argues that ''dojin'' refers to the Sumo Mohe, who were the natives and referred to themselves as such.{{sfn|Sloane|2014a|p=17}}

===Archaeology===
====Burials====
Chinese scholars have argued that the use of single-chambered brick tombs shows Tang influence. These single-chamber brick tombs appear later in Balhae history and appear less frequently. It was probably not due to a lack of other material that brick was used as stone was widely used around the capital sites. In the early 1980s, Nishikawa Hiroshi argued that early Balhae tombs resembled the Balhae practice of joint burial and reburial. Earthen pit tombs have also been interpreted as Mohe practice by Japanese and Chinese scholarship. Yun Jae-Woon argues that vertical-slit pits were used by non-elites universally and that earth tombs were more common in early Balhae, but many features found in Balhae tombs are influenced by Goguryeo, such as above ground structures, roof tiles, and the use of stone.{{sfn|Sloane|2014a|p=23-25}} According to Han Ciu-cheol, Balhae's ruling class used stone lined tombs, stone chambers, and stone coffins which had been used by Goguryeo's ruling class.<ref name="auto3"/>

====Ceramics====
Balhae's ceramic vessels in China have been divided into three stylistic types: Mohe, Goguryeo, and Tang. Early Balhae vessels were mainly categorized as of the Mohe type and used as evidence that Balhae was founded by Mohe. Chinese archaeologists argue that the geographic distribution of Balhae's ceramics match that of the "wide-mouthed, deep-bellied jars of coarse black-brown material" from proceeding centuries in the same area. Chinese archaeologists refer to the previous culture as "Tongren Culture" while texts refer to the inhabitants of the area as "Mohe" and "Wuji" (K. Mulgil, J. Mukkitsu). Later, Balhae pottery show technical improvement and the introduction of three-color glazes.{{sfn|Sloane|2014a|p=26-27}}

Wei Cuncheng argues that "deep-bellied cylindrical jars and bowls" were prevalent from before the 8th century until the 10th or 11th centuries, especially in small burials and outside the capitals. He argues that these are indicative of the Sumo Mohe tribe and demonstrate that the majority of Balhae's population, particularly during its founding, was culturally, and ethnically Mohe. Yun Jae-Woon argues that similar jars have been found at Goguryeo sites but it is unclear if these are of the same type and could date later than the jars Wei refers to. Yun also argues that the jars do not indicate ethnic difference and "should be seen as reflecting social and cultural differences between elites and non-elites and between the center and the provinces."{{sfn|Sloane|2014a|p=27}}

====City planning====
Lee Byeong Gun argues that the pairing of flat riverside settlements with hilltop redoubts distinguishes Balhae settlements from Tang Chinese urban planning. To Lee, mountain sites represent the indigenous culture of Goguryeo, supporting the continuity and succession from Goguryeo to Balhae. Chinese scholarship does not portray Tang and Balhae styles as identical but rather, emphasizes influences on Balhae.{{sfn|Sloane|2014a|p=20}} Round eave-end roof tiles show Goguryeo influence while ceramic ornamentation show Tang influence. The patterns of Balhae style eave-end roof tiles have been used in China for reconstruction of a Tang dynasty site in [[Shanxi]].{{sfn|Sloane|2014a|p=20-21}} Korean scholars argue that the existence of heated platforms in some building sites in the Balhae capital indicate Balhae succession from Goguryeo. Chinese scholars point to the existence of pit dwellings as examples of Mohe culture.{{sfn|Sloane|2014a|p=21-22}} No consensus has been reached yet on the cultural origin of the Lingguang Pagoda located in [[Changbai County]], the only surviving above ground example of Balhae architecture.{{sfn|Sloane|2014a|p=22-23}}
