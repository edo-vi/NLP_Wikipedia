'''Oceanisation''', or '''oceanization''', is the process of formation of an [[ocean]] after continental [[rifting]]. The oceanisation is marked by the accretion of oceanic [[basalts]] between the drifting continental blocks and the incursion of marine waters and species in the [[rift]] basin.<ref>Abbate, Ernesto.
