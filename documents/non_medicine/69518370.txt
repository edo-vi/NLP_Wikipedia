== Construction and molecular characterization ==
MTBVAC discovery follows the principles of vaccination as per Luis Pasteur: isolation of the human pathogen, attenuation by rational inactivation of selected genes, protection assays in animal models, and evaluation in humans.<ref name="Ainhoa" /> 

The main advantage of using live vaccines based on rational attenuation of ''M. tuberculosis'' is their ability to keep the genetic repertoire encoding immunodominant antigens that are absent in BCG,<ref name="Roland">{{cite journal |display-authors=6 |vauthors=Brosch R, Gordon SV, Marmiesse M, Brodin P, Buchrieser C, Eiglmeier K, Garnier T, Gutierrez C, Hewinson G, Kremer K, Parsons LM, Pym AS, Samper S, van Soolingen D, Cole ST |date=March 2002 |title=A new evolutionary scenario for the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume=99 |issue=6 |pages=3684–3689 |bibcode=2002PNAS...99.3684B |doi=10.1073/pnas.052548299 |pmc=122584 |pmid=11891304 |doi-access=free}}</ref> whereas chromosomal deletions in virulence genes provide assurance for safety and genetic stability. Such vaccines are expected to safely induce more specific and longer lasting immune responses in humans that can provide protection against all forms of the disease.<ref name="Ainhoa" /> This is the rationale that has been followed in the development of the live-attenuated MTBVAC. 

The rational attenuation of MTBVAC was achieved by inactivation of the ''phoP'' and ''fadD26'' genes,<ref name="Ainhoa" /> following the international guidelines to progress live vaccines into clinical development.<ref name="Aurum">{{cite journal | vauthors = Kamath AT, Fruth U, Brennan MJ, Dobbelaer R, Hubrechts P, Ho MM, Mayner RE, Thole J, Walker KB, Liu M, Lambert PH | display-authors = 6 | title = New live mycobacterial vaccines: the Geneva consensus on essential steps towards clinical development | journal = Vaccine | volume = 23 | issue = 29 | pages = 3753–3761 | date = May 2005 | pmid = 15893612 | doi = 10.1016/j.vaccine.2005.03.001 }}</ref> Similar to BCG, which was conceived in the early 1900s as an attenuated strain of ''Mycobacterium bovis'' causing TB in cows and transmitted to humans mainly through ingestion of unpasteurized milk, the discovery of MTBVAC starts with an unusual outbreak of a multidrug-resistant ''M. bovis'' killing more than 100 HIV- positive individuals in Spain in the early 1990s.<ref name="Rivero">{{cite journal | vauthors = Rivero A, Márquez M, Santos J, Pinedo A, Sánchez MA, Esteve A, Samper S, Martín C | display-authors = 6 | title = High rate of tuberculosis reinfection during a nosocomial outbreak of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis caused by Mycobacterium bovis strain B | journal = Clinical Infectious Diseases | volume = 32 | issue = 1 | pages = 159–161 | date = January 2001 | pmid = 11112675 | doi = 10.1086/317547 }}</ref> From that outbreak, Prof Carlos Martin and his group identified the ''phoP'' gene as a key player in ''M. tuberculosis'' virulence.<ref name="Esther">{{cite journal | vauthors = Pérez E, Samper S, Bordas Y, Guilhot C, Gicquel B, Martín C | title = An essential role for phoP in Mycobacterium tuberculosis virulence | journal = Molecular Microbiology | volume = 41 | issue = 1 | pages = 179–187 | date = July 2001 | pmid = 11454210 | doi = 10.1046/j.1365-2958.2001.02500.x | s2cid = 22014385 | doi-access = free }}</ref> The gene ''phoP'' encodes the transcription factor PhoP of the two-component system PhoP/PhoR essential for ''M. tuberculosis'' virulence.<ref name="Solans">{{cite journal | vauthors = Solans L, Gonzalo-Asensio J, Sala C, Benjak A, Uplekar S, Rougemont J, Guilhot C, Malaga W, Martín C, Cole ST | display-authors = 6 | title = The PhoP-dependent ncRNA Mcr7 modulates the TAT secretion system in Mycobacterium tuberculosis | journal = PLOS Pathogens | volume = 10 | issue = 5 | pages = e1004183 | date = May 2014 | pmid = 24874799 | pmc = 4038636 | doi = 10.1371/journal.ppat.1004183 | doi-access = free }}</ref><ref name="Jesus">{{cite journal | vauthors = Gonzalo-Asensio J, Malaga W, Pawlik A, Astarie-Dequeker C, Passemar C, Moreau F, Laval F, Daffé M, Martin C, Brosch R, Guilhot C | display-authors = 6 | title = Evolutionary history of tuberculosis shaped by conserved mutations in the PhoPR virulence regulator | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 111 | issue = 31 | pages = 11491–11496 | date = August 2014 | pmid = 25049399 | pmc = 4128152 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1406693111 | doi-access = free | bibcode = 2014PNAS..11111491G }}</ref> PhoP was shown to regulate between 2 and 4% of ''M. tuberculosis'' genes, most of which participate in well-known virulence pathways of the tubercle bacillus.<ref name="Jesus 2">{{cite journal | vauthors = Gonzalo Asensio J, Maia C, Ferrer NL, Barilone N, Laval F, Soto CY, Winter N, Daffé M, Gicquel B, Martín C, Jackson M | display-authors = 6 | title = The virulence-associated two-component PhoP-PhoR system controls the biosynthesis of polyketide-derived lipids in Mycobacterium tuberculosis | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 281 | issue = 3 | pages = 1313–1316 | date = January 2006 | pmid = 16326699 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.C500388200 | doi-access = free }}</ref> As a consequence of the ''phoP'' inactivation, MTBVAC can produce but is unable to export ESAT-6, which results in virulence attenuation, but yet maintains the epitopes present in this immunogenic protein.

== Preclinical research ==
Rigorous preclinical studies in different TB-relevant animal models - mice, guinea pigs and non-human primates - conducted between 2001 and 2011 have shown adequate attenuation, safety and improved immunogenicity and protective efficacy against ''M. tuberculosis'' challenge as compared to BCG, thus fulfilling regulatory WHO guidelines and the Geneva consensus requirements for progressing live mycobacterial vaccines to first-in-human Phase 1 clinical evaluation.<ref name="Carlos 2" /> A successful trial in rhesus macaques was reported in 2021.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2021-01-13 |title=Researchers demonstrate protection offered by novel TB vaccine candidate in animal model |url=https://www.iavi.org/news-resources/press-releases/2021/researchers-demonstrate-protection-offered-by-novel-tb-vaccine-candidate-in-animal-model |access-date=2023-10-27 |website=IAVI |language=en}}</ref>

== Clinical trials ==
The safety and immunogenicity of new vaccines need to be determined in a reduced number of healthy volunteers. Phase 1 studies (can be first-in-human) to define the safety of different ascending doses are usually conducted in small groups of no more than 100 volunteers per trial. These are followed by medium-sized Phase 2 trials (can be > 100) to corroborate safety and determine the optimal therapeutic dose (detailed immunogenicity profile in the case of new vaccines) that helps select the final dose for Phase 3 efficacy evaluation.<ref name="Carlos 2" />

The MTBVAC clinical development started with a first-in-human study in healthy adult volunteers in Lausanne, Switzerland (NCT02013245);<ref name="Spertini">{{cite journal | vauthors = Spertini F, Audran R, Chakour R, Karoui O, Steiner-Monard V, Thierry AC, Mayor CE, Rettby N, Jaton K, Vallotton L, Lazor-Blanchet C, Doce J, Puentes E, Marinova D, Aguilo N, Martin C | display-authors = 6 | title = Safety of human immunisation with a live-attenuated Mycobacterium tuberculosis vaccine: a randomised, double-blind, controlled phase I trial | journal = The Lancet.

Data from the Phase II clinical trials will help define the final (safest and most immunogenic) dose of MTBVAC, triggering the initiation of a multi-center Phase 3 efficacy trial in newborn babies by the second quarter of 2022. Supported by the European & Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership (EDCTP funding), this Phase 3 trial will encompass TB-endemic regions of Sub-Saharan Africa, including South Africa, Madagascar and Senegal (registered on ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04975178).<ref name="Carlos 2" /><ref>{{Cite web |title=NCT04975178 |url=https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04975178 |access-date=2023-10-27 |website=www.clinicaltrials.gov}}</ref>
