{{Short description|Bacterial disease of pigs}}
'''Porcine intestinal spirochaetosis''' is a [[notifiable disease|notifiable]] pig disease caused by certain [[spirochaete|spirochetal]] bacteria (''Brachyspira hyodysenteriae'' and ''[[Brachyspira pilosicoli]]''. Infection causes mild gastrointestinal signs in young [[pig]]s and can also be transmitted as [[intestinal spirochetosis]] in humans, as it is a [[zoonosis]].

The disease is widespread in pig-rearing countries and may be referred to as PIS, spirochaetal diarrhoea and porcine colonic spirochaetosis.

==Clinical signs and diagnosis==
Clinical signs are most commonly seen in young pigs aged eight to 14 weeks. Normally, a greyish [[diarrhoea]] is seen in individual piglets, and poor growth rates and [[feed conversion ratio]]s are observed on a herd level.

Stress, caused by moving and mixing groups of piglets, can increase incidence.

A definitive diagnosis can be made by [[Bacterial culture|culturing the bacterium]] on a specific [[Agar plate|blood agar]] medium, followed by [[Polymerase chain reaction|PCR]]. Alternatively, [[necropsy]] and [[histology|histological examination]] of the large intestine can confirm the diagnosis.

==Treatment and control==
[[Antibiotics]] are the treatment of choice. They should be administered by injection or in drinking water. Pig husbandry measures should be employed to ensure that stressors such as the mixing and moving of pigs are kept to a minimum to reduce disease incidence.
