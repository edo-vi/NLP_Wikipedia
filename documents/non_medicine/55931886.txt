A '''bioactive terrarium''' (or [[vivarium]]) is a terrarium for housing one or more terrestrial animal species that includes live plants and populations of small [[invertebrate]]s and [[microorganism]]s to consume and break down the waste products of the primary species. In a functional bioactive terrarium, the waste products will be broken down by these [[Detritivore|detritivores]], reducing or eliminating the need for cage cleaning. Bioactive vivariums are used by zoos and hobbyists to house reptiles and amphibians in an aesthetically pleasing and [[Behavioral enrichment|enriched]] environment.

==Enclosure==
Any terrarium can be made bioactive by addition of the appropriate substrate, plants, and detritivores. Bioactive enclosures are often maintained as display terraria constructed of PVC, wood, glass and/or acrylic. Bioactive enclosures in laboratory "rack" style caging are uncommon. 

==Cleanup crew==

==Substrate==

Bioactive enclosures require some form of substrate to grow plants and to provide habitat for the cleanup crew.  The choice of substrate is typically determined by the habitat of the primary species (e.g. jungle vs desert), and created by mixing a variety of components such as organic topsoil (free of pesticides and non-biological fertilizers), peat, coco fiber, sand, long-fiber sphagnum moss, cypress mulch, and orchid bark in varying proportions.<ref name=":4" />  

In wet habitats, there is typically a drainage layer beneath the substrate to allow water to pool without saturating the substrate.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|last=|first=|title=Amphibian Husbandry Resource Guide, Edition 2.0|publisher=Association of Zoos and Aquariums|year=2012|isbn=|url=https://assets.speakcdn.com/assets/2332/amphibianhusbandryresourceguide.pdf|pages=8-17}}</ref><ref name=":1" /> The drainage layer may be constructed via coarse gravel, stones, expanded clay aggregate, or may be wholly synthetic; the drainage layer is typically separated from the overlying substrate with a fine plastic mesh.<ref name=":4" /><ref name=":0" />  Additionally, some bioactive terraria include leaf-litter, which can serve as food and microhabitat for the cleanup crew.<ref name=":4" />

==Plants==
The use of live plants in a bioactive terrarium provides cover for animals inhabiting the enclosure, is aesthetically pleasing in a display enclosure, and can help to absorb nitrogenous wastes that could otherwise build up in a system.<ref name=":4" /><ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" /> Providing a variety of plants that will grow in and be clipped back during maintenance provides hiding spots for terrarium inhabitants that change over time. This is a form of enrichment recommended for keeping reptiles.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.aazk.org/wp-content/uploads/Suggested-Guidelines-for-Reptile-Enrichment.pdf|title=Suggested Guidelines for Reptile Enrichment|last=|first=|date=|website=American Association of Zookeepers|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211113060515/https://www.aazk.org/wp-content/uploads/Suggested-Guidelines-for-Reptile-Enrichment.pdf |archive-date=2021-11-13 |access-date=}}</ref>
