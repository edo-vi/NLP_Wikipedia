{{Short description|Hypothetical future with AI-designed laws}}
A '''legal singularity''' is a hypothetical future point in time beyond which the [[law]] is much more completely specified,<ref name=":0">{{Cite book |last=Aidid |first=Abdi |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1348635469 |title=The legal singularity : how artificial intelligence can make law radically better |date=2023 |others=Benjamin Alarie |isbn=978-1-4875-2941-3 |location=Toronto |oclc=1348635469}}</ref> with human lawmakers and other legal actors being supported by rapid technological advancements and [[artificial intelligence]] (AI), leading to a vast reduction in legal uncertainty.<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal |last=Alarie |first=Benjamin |date=2016 |title=The Path of the Law: Toward Legal Singularity |url=https://www.ssrn.com/abstract=2767835 |journal=SSRN Electronic Journal |language=en |doi=10.2139/ssrn.2767835 |hdl=1807/88159 |issn=1556-5068|hdl-access=free }}</ref>

The legal singularity is based on the idea that as AI systems become more advanced, they will be capable of processing and analyzing vast amounts of legal data and case law more quickly and accurately than humans.<ref name=":1" /> This could potentially lead to a situation where AI systems become the primary legal decision-makers, and humans are relegated to a more supervisory role.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Weber |first=Robert |date=2021 |title=Will the "Legal Singularity" Hollow Out Law's Normative Core? |journal=Michigan Technology Law Review |volume=27 |issue=1 |pages=97 |doi=10.36645/mtlr.27.1.will |s2cid=208278485 |issn=2688-5484|doi-access=free }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Alarie |first1=Benjamin |last2=Niblett |first2=Anthony |last3=Yoon |first3=Albert |date=2016 |title=Regulation by Machine |url=http://www.ssrn.com/abstract=2878950 |journal=SSRN Electronic Journal |language=en |doi=10.2139/ssrn.2878950 |hdl=1807/88153 |issn=1556-5068|hdl-access=free }}</ref>
