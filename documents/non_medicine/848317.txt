'''Violence in sports''' usually refers to violent and often unnecessarily harmful intentional physical acts committed during, or motivated by, a [[sports|sports game]], often in relation to contact sports such as [[American football]], [[ice hockey]], [[rugby football]], [[lacrosse]], [[association football]], [[boxing]], [[mixed martial arts]], [[wrestling]], and [[water polo]] and, when referring to the players themselves, often involving excessively violent or potentially illegal physical contact beyond the normal levels of contact expected while playing the sport. These acts of violence can include intentional attempts to injure a player or coach by another player or coach, but can also include threats of physical harm or actual physical harm sustained by players or coaches by fans or those engaging in the spectating of sports, or threats and acts of violence performed by fans or spectators upon opposing fans or other spectators.

==Causes==
There are two major theories on the cause of violence in sports. One theory holds that humans have an instinct for violence, developed during a time when early human ancestors had to resort to violence and aggressiveness to survive and reproduce. Another theory deals with the sociological aspects of violence in sports, stating that sports are "mock battles" which can become actual battles due to their competitive nature.<ref name="Salamone2000">{{cite book |last1=Salamone |first1=Frank A. |title=Society, Culture, Leisure and Play |year=2000 |publisher=University Press of America |location=Lanham, Maryland |isbn=9780761816256 |pages=273–4}}</ref>

==Violence by athletes==
Through a "civilizing process", many modern sports have become less tolerant of bloodshed than past versions, although many violent aspects of these sports still remain.<ref name="Salamone2000"/>
 
Athletes sometimes resort to violence, in hopes of injuring and intimidating opponents. Such incidents may be part of a strategy developed by coaches or players.

In boxing, unruly or extremely violent behavior by one of the contestants often results in the fighter breaking the rules being penalized with a points reduction, or, in extreme cases, disqualification. Outlawed tactics in boxing include hitting the opponent on the back of the head, under the belly during clinching, and to the back. Other tactics that are outlawed, but less seen, are pushing an opponent extremely hard to the floor, kicking, or hitting repeatedly after the round has ended. Similar actions have also happened in [[ice hockey]] and [[Australian Football League]] matches.

===Ritual violence===
High school, college, and even professional sports teams often include [[initiation]] ceremonies (known as [[hazing]] in the USA) as a [[rite of passage]]. A 1999 study by [[Alfred University]] and the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] found that approximately four out of five college US athletes (250,000 per year) experienced hazing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alfred.edu/sports_hazing/.|title=Alfred University : News : NCAA Sports Survey|access-date=October 8, 2015}}</ref> Half were required to take part in alcohol-related initiations, while two-thirds were subjected to humiliation rituals.

==Fan violence==

Violence may also be related to [[nationalism]] or as an outlet for underlying [[social tension]]s. It is often [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]]-related.

Violence by supporters of sports teams dates back to [[Roman Empire|Roman]] times, when supporters of chariot racing teams were frequently involved in major riots, leading Roman authorities to frequently cancel sporting events.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cassel |first1=Elaine |last2=Bernstein |first2=Douglas A. |title=Criminal Behavior |date=3 April 2007 |publisher=Psychology Press |isbn=978-1-135-61476-8 |page=121 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RKp7Utw4VcsC |language=en}}</ref> Usually, underlying political and/or theological issues helped fuel riots related to sporting events in the Roman era. The [[Nika riots]] of 532 were especially deadly, with tens of thousands reportedly killed.

In periods when theatre was considered a form of mass entertainment, there were phenomena of rival fans supporting rival actors or theatrical teams, occasionally leading to violent outbursts having many similarities to present-day violence of sports fans – the [[Astor Place Riot]] in 1849 New York City being a conspicuous example.

The actions of English [[association football|football]] [[football hooliganism|hooligans]] and [[football firm|firms]] in the 1980s caused English teams to be banned from European competition for six years after the [[Heysel Stadium disaster]] in 1985. Although the level of football-related violence was significantly reduced in England after this event, in the recent [[UEFA Euro 2004|Euro 2004]] tournament, [[England national football team|England]] was publicly warned that any violence by supporters at matches could result in their ejection from the tournament. Many known hooligans were prevented from traveling to the tournament in Portugal. There was a collective sigh of relief from security experts in the USA when England failed to qualify for the [[1994 FIFA World Cup]]. [[Alan Rothenberg]] (chairman of the World Cup organizing committee in the United States in 1994) said:

{{cquote|There were three countries in the world whose presence would have created logistical and security problems, so we're very pleased they won't be coming: Iraq, Iran and England.}}

===Notable examples of fan violence===

* In AD 59, a [[gladiator]] show in [[Pompeii]] led to a riot involving residents of Pompei and neighboring [[Nuceria]], leading to numerous deaths. After an investigation by the [[Roman Senate]], the town of Pompeii was banned from holding gladiator shows for 10 years.<ref>Tacitus, ''Annales'', XIV.17</ref>
* In 532, the rivalry between supporters of the ''Blue'' and ''Green'' [[chariot racing#Byzantine context|chariot-racing]] teams in [[Constantinople]] led to 30,000 deaths in the [[Nika riots]].
* The first meeting in the [[Holy War (BYU–Utah)|American football rivalry]] between [[BYU Cougars football|Brigham Young University]] and the [[Utah Utes football|University of Utah]] took place in April 1896, when BYU was known as Brigham Young Academy. The two schools disagree to this day as to whether this game was official, but it mattered greatly to the spectators—at the end of the game, the two sets of fans fought one another.
* In the second edition of the [[Tour de France]] in [[1904 Tour de France|1904]], as the riders climbed the [[Col de la République]] in the [[Loire (department)|Loire]] [[Departments of France|department]], supporters of regional favorite [[Antoine Faure]] physically attacked several of his opponents.<ref>Woodland, Les (2007), ''The Yellow Jersey Guide to the Tour de France'', Yellow Jersey Press, p.99</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.velo101.com/actualite/default.asp?Id=2981&Section=Route |title=Tour 1904 : mort de son succès| work=Vélo 101, le site officiel du vélo |publisher=Velo101.com |date=October 30, 2001 |access-date=July 20, 2012|language= fr}}</ref> The repercussions of this incident continue to this day—the Tour did not return to Loire until [[1950 Tour de France|1950]], and although the Tour has returned to the République (the first pass of 1,000 metres ever climbed in the Tour<ref>{{cite book| title= The Yellow Jersey Companion to the Tour de France|last= Woodland|first= Les| publisher=Yellow Jersey Press| year=2003 | isbn=0-224-063189|page=264}}</ref>) 11 times since then, its appearances in the [[1903 Tour de France|1903]] and 1904 Tours are no longer officially recognized as Tour climbs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sportgeschiedenis.nl/2007/11/10/col-de-la-republique-was-eerste-berg-in-tour-de-france.aspx|title=Col de la République was eerste berg in Tour de France|author=Van den Bogaart, Ronnie|language=nl|date=November 10, 2007|access-date=July 23, 2012|publisher=Sportgeschiedenis|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120226001610/http://www.sportgeschiedenis.nl/2007/11/10/col-de-la-republique-was-eerste-berg-in-tour-de-france.aspx|archive-date=February 26, 2012|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>
* In 1972, [[Oregon Ducks football|Oregon]] pummeled [[Oregon State Beavers football|Oregon State]] 30–3 in their annual [[Oregon–Oregon State football rivalry|"Civil War"]] football rivalry game, held this season at Oregon State's [[Parker Stadium]]. After the game, jubilant Oregon fans rushed the field and tore down the south goal post. They then turned to do the same to the north goal post, but were met by Oregon State fans who had come on the field, resulting in a major brawl.<ref name=TO112208>{{cite web|url=http://blog.oregonlive.com/behindbeaversbeat/2008/11/civil_war_5_moments_that_fanne.html |title=Civil War: 5 moments that fanned the flames of the rivalry |first=Seth |last=Prince |work=The Oregonian |date=November 22, 2008 |access-date=September 7, 2011}}</ref>
* In [[1975 Tour de France|1975]], cyclist [[Eddy Merckx]] was viciously punched by a spectator as he climbed the [[Puy-de-Dôme]] in the Tour de France. Merckx, who had won the Tour de France five times previously and at the time was in the leader's yellow jersey, finished the stage barely able to breathe, and went on to finish the tour in second place overall.
* The [[Scottish Cup 1979–80|1980 Scottish Cup Final]] between bitter [[Old Firm]] rivals [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] and [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] was marred by an on-pitch riot between rival fans.<ref>{{cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daEMvQsWys8 |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211221/daEMvQsWys8 |archive-date=2021-12-21 |url-status=live|title=Celtic 1 Rangers 0 1980 Scottish 'riot' Cup Final|access-date=October 8, 2015}}{{cbignore}}</ref> The result was the banning of alcohol from Scottish football and rugby matches.
* After [[Marvin Hagler]] knocked out [[Alan Minter]] in three rounds to win boxing's world middleweight title at [[Wembley Arena]] in 1980, many of Minter's supporters began to throw beer cans, bottles and other objects into the ring. Both Hagler and Minter, along with their respective handlers, had to be escorted out by [[Metropolitan Police Service|Scotland Yard]].
* On August 12, 1984, during a game between the [[Atlanta Braves]] and [[San Diego Padres]] that degenerated into a [[beanball]] war:<ref name="Beanball war">{{cite book |title=Baseball Hall of Shame |last=Nash |first=Bruce |author2=Zullo, Allan  |year=1989 |publisher=Simon & Schuster |location=New York |isbn= 978-0-671-68766-3 |pages=63–64 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QtX4CreRGNEC&q=braves+padres+beanball+war&pg=PT43 |access-date=October 13, 2010}}</ref>
** At least five fans were dragged from the field at [[Atlanta–Fulton County Stadium]] in handcuffs after participating in a bench-clearing brawl.
** One of the fans was charged with assault for throwing a full beer mug at the Padres' [[Kurt Bevacqua]], hitting him in the head, as he was returning to the dugout.
** The game ended with police riot squads on top of both dugouts in an obvious attempt to keep fans away from the players.
* At the end of [[1984 Major League Baseball season|the same season]], violence erupted outside of [[Tiger Stadium (Detroit)|Tiger Stadium]] in Detroit after the [[Detroit Tigers]] defeated the Padres in the [[World Series]]. A well known photo from the riot shows a Tigers fan holding a World Series pennant in front of an overturned burning Detroit Police car.
* [[Heysel Stadium disaster]] – 39 people died when a wall collapsed under pressure of [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] supporters fleeing from 'football [[football hooliganism|hooligans]]' supporting [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] during the [[1985 European Cup Final]].
* [[Dinamo–Red Star riot]] – a 1990 football match between [[Red Star Belgrade]] and [[GNK Dinamo Zagreb|Dinamo Zagreb]] was abandoned after ten minutes with thousands of fans fighting each other and the police. One of the Zagreb players, [[Zvonimir Boban]], was seen to kick a policeman, and after an hour long riot, the stadium was set on fire. Dinamo fans saw the riot as the beginning of the [[Croatian War of Independence]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Montague|first=James|title=Five games that changed the world|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/SPORT/football/01/05/iraq.asia.six.games/index.html|work=CNN|access-date=May 13, 2011}}</ref>

* In 1994, [[Vancouver Canucks]] fans [[1994 Stanley Cup riot|rioted]] in the streets of [[Vancouver]] after their team lost in the [[1994 Stanley Cup Finals|Stanley Cup finals]].
* During the [[1994 FIFA World Cup]], [[Colombia national football team|Colombian]] football (soccer) player [[Andrés Escobar]] accidentally scored an [[own goal]] in a match against the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States]], a match which Colombia lost 2–1.  On his return to [[Colombia]], Escobar was confronted outside a bar in [[Medellín]] by a gunman who shot the player six times, killing him.  The gunman reportedly shouted "''¡Gol!''" ("Goal!") for each bullet fired.
* Rioting Indian fans at the Eden Gardens stadium in [[Kolkata|Calcutta]] forced the end of the semi-final match between [[India national cricket team|India]] and [[Sri Lanka national cricket team|Sri Lanka]] during the [[1996 Cricket World Cup]]. Fans started rioting when the home team, seemingly on the way to victory, underwent a dramatic batting collapse. [[Match referee]] [[Clive Lloyd]] brought the teams off the ground for their safety, then attempted to restart the match. When the fans remained throwing projectiles and damaging stadium facilities, the match was called off and awarded to Sri Lanka (who went on to win the World Cup).
* In 1996 during a night [[Australian Football League]] match at [[Waverley Park]] in [[Melbourne]] between [[Essendon Football Club|Essendon]] and [[St Kilda Football Club|St Kilda]], a [[pitch invasion]] occurred when the lights went out during the third quarter. Initially, a serious car crash into power lines in the nearby area was reported to have caused the [[Power outage|blackout]], although it was later confirmed to be a major electrical fault. In the midst of the chaos, fans rioted and stormed the ground, some lighting bonfires in the centre square, and removing two of the behind posts. The incidents were filmed on [[Network Seven]], and the remaining quarter and a half was played three nights later.<ref>[http://home.vicnet.net.au/~brad/96/round10.htm Round 10 1996, Essendon vs. St Kilda], Bomber Internet</ref>
* In 1998, [[Denver Broncos]] fans rioted in the streets of [[Denver]] after their team won [[Super Bowl XXXII]]. Near-riots happened when the team won the Super Bowl again the following year and after the [[Colorado Avalanche]]'s [[Stanley Cup]] wins in 1996 and 2001.
* A similar incident occurred in [[Oakland, California]] in 2003 when fans rioted and destroyed property after the [[Oakland Raiders]] lost to the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] in [[Super Bowl XXXVII]].
* In July 2000, 13 people were trampled to death in a riot at a [[2002 FIFA World Cup]] qualifying match in [[Harare]], Zimbabwe after [[South Africa national football team|South Africa]] took a 2–0 lead over [[Zimbabwe national football team|Zimbabwe]].
* In June 2000, [[Los Angeles Lakers]] fans stormed the streets of Los Angeles after the Lakers' victory over the [[Indiana Pacers]] in the [[2000 NBA Finals]]. Fans briefly celebrated by starting [[bonfire]]s, but it soon turned into a riot, with fans dancing and stomping on parked cars, and even turning a news van over.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sport/798383.stm |work=BBC News | title=Riots after Lakers win NBA title | date=June 20, 2000 | access-date=2010-05-27}}</ref>
* In May 2001 during an Australian Football League match between [[Geelong Football Club|Geelong]] and [[Carlton Football Club|Carlton]] at [[Visy Park|Optus Oval]], Geelong's Darren Milburn executed a very late and illegal [[Bump (football)|bump]] on Carlton's [[Steven Silvagni]], collecting Silvagni's head with his hip, knocking Silvagni unconscious and leaving him having to be carried from the field by trainers. Milburn then proceeded to clap towards the crowd after being substituted, further igniting the situation; Carlton fans threatened Milburn, attempted to enter the interchange box to assault him, and attempted to attack Milburn's police escort in the car park after the match.<ref>Atwell, Glen.

* In May 2004 after an [[Australian Football League]] Friday Night Football match between [[Adelaide Football Club|Adelaide]] and St Kilda at [[AAMI Stadium]] which St Kilda won by 32 points, field umpires were booed and abused by Adelaide fans, and a drink bottle was thrown which hit a 12-year-old St Kilda fan. One fan was ejected and banned for one year from the arena.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/sport/crows-fan-faces-ban/story-e6frecj3-1225698262430|title=Crows fan facing one year ban after young Saints fan injured}}</ref>
* In September 2004 in the [[AFL Cairns|Cairns Australian Football League]] Grand Final between the North Cairns Tigers and the Port Douglas Crocs at [[Cazaly's Stadium]], a wild and violent 15&nbsp;minute bench-clearing brawl erupted after Tigers players charged at the Crocs pre-match huddle at the end of the national anthem, and escalated when fans and team officials became involved. One fan was arrested and another five were ejected, while three Crocs players and a Crocs runner were left unconscious and having to be carried from the arena on stretchers. After a lengthy AFL investigation, the instigator, North Cairns Tigers coach and former VFL/AFL player Jason Love, was suspended for eight years, and the 22 North Cairns players were suspended for a total of 400 matches (suspensions ranging from 10 matches to five years) on a string of charges in relation to starting the brawl; the Tigers were forced to forfeit their first match of 2005 as a result of these suspensions. AFL Cairns declared the Grand Final a "no result" and withheld the 2004 premiership.<ref name="ABC_AU_554742">{{cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2004-09-20/probe-launched-into-cairns-afl-brawl/554742 |title=Probe launched into Cairns AFL brawl |date=September 20, 2004 |work=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]] |access-date=November 29, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/pm/content/2004/s1203277.htm|title=PM – AFL yet to decide fate of brawling players|website=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]|access-date=October 8, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/AFL/Eightyear-ban-for-exSwan/2005/02/23/1109046993483.html | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | title=Eight-year ban for ex-Swan | date=February 24, 2005}}</ref>
* In October 2004, after the Boston Red Sox defeated the New York Yankees at Yankee Stadium in Game 7 of the [[2004 American League Championship Series|American League Championship Series]], Red Sox fans rioted near Fenway Park in Boston. Police used "pepper guns" in some cases, and an Emerson College student, [[Shooting of Victoria Snelgrove|Victoria Snelgrove]], was killed by a paintball-like projectile that hit her in the eye.
* On November 19, 2004, near the end of an [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] game between the [[Indiana Pacers]] and [[Detroit Pistons]], a [[Pacers–Pistons brawl|brawl]] erupted between Pacers players and Pistons supporters.
* On April 12, 2005, the [[UEFA Champions League]] quarterfinal between [[local derby|intracity rivals]] [[A.C. Milan]] and [[Inter Milan]] was abandoned after Inter fans threw missiles and flares on to the pitch at the [[San Siro]] stadium, with A.C. Milan goalkeeper [[Dida (goalkeeper)|Dida]] hit by a flare.
* In May 2006 during an [[Australian Football League]] match between [[North Melbourne Football Club|North Melbourne]] and [[St Kilda Football Club|St Kilda]], a North Melbourne fan had a provocative confrontation with coach [[Dean Laidley]], to which Laidley responded with a verbal barrage, inviting the fan to the club rooms to see how badly the players were feeling due to their consistently poor on-field performance. The incident was captured on Australian national television. The fan committed suicide by throwing himself in the path of an oncoming train the next morning.
* On June 6, 2010, the final game of the [[Greek Basket League]] finals between ancient rivals [[Olympiacos B.C.|Olympiacos]] and [[Panathinaikos B.C.|Panathinaikos]] (PAO), also respectively known as the "Reds" and "Greens" from their club colors, degenerated into what one commentator called a "night of shame" for [[Basketball in Greece|Greek basketball]].<ref name="Night of shame">{{cite web |url=http://www.ballineurope.com/countries/greece/panathinaikos-olympiacos-greece-basketball-championship-riot-7669/ |title=On "Night of Shame", Panathinaikos Takes 8th Consecutive Greek Title in Riot Conditions |work=BallinEurope.com |date=June 7, 2010 |access-date=June 6, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629090042/http://www.ballineurope.com/countries/greece/panathinaikos-olympiacos-greece-basketball-championship-riot-7669/ |archive-date=June 29, 2011 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Panathinaikos entered the game, held at Olympiacos' home of [[Peace and Friendship Stadium]], with a 2–1 lead in the best-of-5 series.

* The [[2011 Vancouver Stanley Cup riot]] immediately followed the loss of the Vancouver Canucks hockey team to the Boston Bruins in the deciding Game 7 of the Stanley Cup Finals in June of that year.
* Later in the same month, major violence broke out involving supporters of historic Argentine football club [[Club Atlético River Plate|River Plate]] during and after their promotion/relegation playoff with [[Club Atlético Belgrano|Belgrano]]. The first leg on June 22 [[Estadio Gigante de Alberdi|in Córdoba]] was delayed for 20 minutes after River Plate hooligans tore through a fence and stormed the field to verbally and physically attack River players. The second leg, on June 26 at [[Estadio Monumental Antonio Vespucio Liberti|El Monumental]] in Buenos Aires, had what was reported to be the largest security presence for any match in the country's history, with over 2,200 police called in. However, it was not enough to keep River hooligans, angered at what became the club's first relegation from the top flight in their history, from rushing the field. Violence quickly spread, with fires set in the stadium, pitched battles between hooligans and police, and looting in nearby areas. At least 35 police and 55 civilians were reported to have been injured.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/sports/soccer/news/_/id/6706438/river-plate-relegated-argentine-2nd-division-first-time-club-history |title=Chaos erupts after River Plate relegated |agency=Associated Press |publisher=ESPN |date=June 27, 2011 |access-date=June 27, 2011}}</ref>
* On December 21, 2011, a [[2011–12 KNVB Cup#Fourth round|fourth round]] match in the [[2011–12 KNVB Cup]] between [[Eredivisie]] clubs [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]] and [[AZ (football club)|AZ]] at Ajax's home of [[Amsterdam Arena]] was marred by a violent fan incident. In the 36th minute, Ajax held a 1–0 lead when a fan ran on the pitch and launched a karate kick from behind at AZ goalkeeper [[Esteban Alvarado]]. The player responded by kicking the fan several times before security arrived. When Alvarado was [[Misconduct (association football)#Sending-off offences (red card)|sent off]] for retaliating against his attacker, AZ left the pitch, and the match was abandoned. The [[Royal Dutch Football Association|KNVB]] rescinded the red card and ordered the match replayed in its entirety [[Behind closed doors (football)|behind closed doors]] on January 19, 2012. Ajax was also fined €10,000 for failing to prevent the fan—who was supposed to be serving a 3-year stadium ban—from entering the pitch, and given a suspended one-match spectator ban (not including the replay).

===American football===
* In a [[National Football League]] game on November 1, 1970, the [[Kansas City Chiefs]] led the [[Oakland Raiders]] 17–14, and a long run for a first-down run by quarterback [[Len Dawson]] apparently sealed victory for the Chiefs in the final minute when Dawson was speared by Raiders defensive end [[Ben Davidson]], who dove into Dawson with his helmet as he lay on the ground, provoking Chiefs’ receiver [[Otis Taylor (American football)|Otis Taylor]] to attack Davidson. After a bench-clearing brawl, Taylor and Davidson were ejected, and the penalties that were called nullified the first down under the rules in effect at that time. The Chiefs were obliged to punt, and the Raiders tied the game on a [[George Blanda]] field goal with eight seconds to play. Taylor's unwise retaliation against Davidson's foul play not only cost the Chiefs a win, but Oakland won the AFC West with a season record of 8–4–2, while Kansas City finished 7–5–2 and out of the playoffs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.kcchiefs.com/history/70s/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090619085937/http://www.kcchiefs.com/history/70s/|url-status=dead|title=KC Chiefs website|archivedate=June 19, 2009}}</ref> See also [[Chiefs–Raiders rivalry]].

At the final minutes of match, Boca Juniors [[Roberto Rogel]] fell to the floor in the penalty area, but the Uruguayan referee Alejandro Otero dismissed their penalty appeal. Boca Junior's player [[Rubén Suñé]] retaliated by violently shin-kicking Sporting Cristal's [[Alfredo Quesada]] during the next passage of play. The contact between both players soon escalated and involved both teams violently fighting each other. 19 red cards were issued, 10 Peruvian and 9 Argentine players were arrested after the incident.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Williamson |first=Dan |date=2018-07-30 |title=The day 19 players were sent off when Boca Juniors played Sporting Cristal |url=https://thesefootballtimes.co/2018/07/31/the-day-19-players-were-sent-off-when-boca-juniors-played-sporting-cristal/ |access-date=2023-10-22 |website=These Football Times |language=en-GB}}</ref>

* In 1994 Swans recruit [[Dermott Brereton]] was suspended for 7 weeks for standing on [[Hawthorn Football Club|Hawthorn]] player [[Rayden Tallis]]' head during a practice match; he was suspended for another 7 matches later in the season for elbowing [[Richmond Football Club|Richmond]] captain Tony Free and breaking his jaw. When Brereton transferred to Collingwood at the end of 1994 the AFL decided that his 7-week suspension was no longer applicable as it was applied to the club (Sydney) and not to the player (Brereton).

** Yet another game in the same era saw a Utah player get a base hit with two outs and two on in the bottom of the ninth inning in a tied game. The lead runner could have scored the winning run uncontested—but he instead went out of his way to run over BYU's catcher, who was standing on the first-base side of home plate (the opposite side from a runner heading for home). The runner was called out and ejected, and BYU went on to win in extra innings.<ref name="Utah-BYU baseball 2"/>
* On August 12, 1984, a game between the [[Atlanta Braves]] and [[San Diego Padres]] turned into what writers Bruce Nash and Allan Zullo later called "one of the worst [[beanball]] wars of modern times", starting with Braves pitcher [[Pascual Pérez (baseball)|Pascual Pérez]] [[hit by pitch|hitting]] [[Alan Wiggins]] with the game's first pitch, followed by four attempts by Padres pitchers to hit Pérez in retaliation, and ending in Braves reliever [[Donnie Moore]] hitting [[Graig Nettles]]. The chaos led to four bench-clearing incidents, one of which lasted at least 10&nbsp;minutes; ejections of both managers and 12 players and coaches; multiple suspensions of individuals involved in the fracas; and fan involvement (see above).<ref name="Beanball war"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/page2/s/list/basebrawl.html |title=Put up your dukes |work=Page 2 |first=Jeff |last=Merron |publisher=ESPN |access-date=October 13, 2010}}</ref>

Ohio State's [[Luke Witte]] was fouled hard going to the basket by Minnesota's Corky Taylor, who punched the dazed Witte in the face and kneed him in the groin. Gopher reserve [[Ron Behagen]] then stomped on Witte's neck and head. Witte was not the only victim of violence, as a larger brawl broke out, with two other Gophers, [[Jim Brewer (basketball)|Jim Brewer]] and future [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Baseball Hall of Famer]] [[Dave Winfield]], attacking other Ohio State players. Witte was taken off the court on a stretcher and booed by Minnesota fans. He was the most seriously injured among three Buckeyes players taken to hospitals.<ref>http://www.10000takes.com/hall_of_shame/> {{bare URL inline|date=May 2023}}</ref>
* In an [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] game on December 9, 1977, [[Kermit Washington]] of the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] was already fighting with [[Kevin Kunnert]] of the [[Houston Rockets]] when [[Rudy Tomjanovich]] of the Rockets came running toward them. Seeing a man in an opponent uniform rushing at him, Washington instinctively turned and punched Tomjanovich in the face, resulting in a near-fatal season-ending injury to Tomjanovich. The NBA suspended Washington for 60 days (26 games) and fined him $10,000.  A civil jury awarded Tomjanovich $3.2 million.  This incident is the subject of the book ''The Punch'' by [[John Feinstein]].
* On November 19, 2004, the infamous [[The Malice at the Palace|Malice at the Palace]] between the [[Detroit Pistons]] and the [[Indiana Pacers]] players, as well as spectators, took place in [[Auburn Hills, Michigan]]. It ranks among the worst episodes of sports violence in [[Sports in the United States|American sports]] history.

The melee started when Greece's [[Antonis Fotsis]] moved threateningly toward Serbia's [[Miloš Teodosić]] after a hard foul. Teodosic responded by punching Fotsis in the face while [[Nenad Krstić]] also tried to grab the Greek player. Greece's 360&nbsp;lb center [[Sofoklis Schortsanitis]] joined the fight attacking multiple Serbian players and spreading havoc. Krstic punched Schortsanitis several times in his back. When he started pursuing the retreating Krstić, the Serbian player responded by throwing a chair at him. The chair missed Schortsanitis but hit his teammate [[Ioannis Bourousis]] in the head, drawing blood. Players from both teams fought in the tunnel leading from the arena before being separated, and a few fans joined the fight but were quickly taken from the arena.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/sports/2010/08/19/friendly-acropolis-tourney-ends-bench-clearing-brawl-forces-abandonment-greece/ |title=Friendly Acropolis tourney ends when bench-clearing brawl forces abandonment of Greece-Serbia |agency=Associated Press |publisher=[[Fox News Channel|Fox News]] |date=August 19, 2010 |access-date=2011-01-05}}</ref> Krstić was arrested by Greek police, but was released the following day.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=5478923 |title=Police release Nenad Krstic after melee |agency=Associated Press |publisher=ESPN |date=August 21, 2010 |access-date=2011-01-05}}</ref> [[International Basketball Federation|FIBA]] responded by suspending two players from each team for part of the subsequent [[2010 FIBA World Championship|FIBA World Championship]].

* Later that year, on October 12, an exhibition match between the [[China national basketball team|China]] and [[Brazil national basketball team|Brazil]] national teams in [[Xuchang]] was marred by rough play from both sides before escalating into open exchanges of kicks and punches, followed by a bench-clearing brawl. After the teams were separated, China players attacked the Brazilians as they were heading to the locker room. Brazil refused to return to the court or to play the fourth and final match in their scheduled series. The Chinese national federation issued an official apology to Brazil the following day.

*On August 18, 2011, another Chinese team, the [[Bayi Rockets]] of the [[Chinese Basketball Association]], was involved in a major scuffle with the touring [[Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball|Georgetown University men's team]]. After three quarters of highly physical play from both sides, the game turned ugly with the teams tied at 64 with 9:32 remaining in the final quarter. At that point, both benches emptied and the teams began fighting one another. One Georgetown player had a chair thrown at him by an unidentified individual, with reports differing on whether he was hit. Another Georgetown player who had been struck during the brawl picked up a chair in apparent self-defense. As the brawl progressed, some fans joined in the action, with one wielding a stanchion. Hoyas coach [[John Thompson III]] pulled his team from the court; the team had to dodge water bottles and other objects thrown by fans, and one Georgetown fan was reportedly knocked to the ground by a thrown bottle.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/6873726/georgetown-hoyas-chinese-professional-team-game-ends-brawl |title=Georgetown, Chinese pro team brawl |first=Dana |last=O'Neil |publisher=ESPN |date=August 19, 2011 |access-date=August 31, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/colleges/fight-ends-georgetown-basketball-exhibition-in-china/2011/08/18/gIQAs1zeNJ_story.html |title=Georgetown basketball exhibition in China ends in brawl |first=Gene |last=Wang |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=August 18, 2011 |access-date=August 31, 2011}}</ref>

With Australia leading by over 30 points with just over 4:00 left in the third quarter, play was halted for a foul. Australia's [[Daniel Kickert]] then swung his elbow at an [[Roger Pogoy|unsuspecting Philippines player]], immediately leading to both benches clearing and a melee spreading from the bench to one of the baskets. When order was restored and game officials reviewed video of the incident, a total of 13 players were ejected—four from Australia (including Kickert) and nine from the Philippines. This left the hosts with only three players to resume the game; after two of the remaining Philippines players fouled out, leaving that team with only one player, the officials called the game, with Australia winning 89–53.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.espn.com/olympics/basketball/story/_/id/23974221/milwaukee-bucks-center-thon-maker-brawl-fiba-qualifying-game |title=Bucks center Thon Maker in middle of brawl during FIBA qualifying game |website=[[ESPN.com]] |date=2018-07-02 |access-date=2018-07-02}}</ref>

A second bench-clearing brawl erupted before the third period began, provoked by the announcement of penalties; a total of 252 penalty minutes were incurred and 10 players were ejected.

Event organizers, in a futile attempt to stop the fighting, turned the arena lights off. Eventually, the game was declared null and void, and both teams were ejected from the competition, costing the Canadians a medal. Virtually all of the players on the Canadian team got suspended for 18 months, while the Soviet Union players were permanently banned from international competition, and the coaching staffs of both teams were fired. The match referee, widely blamed for losing control of the game, never worked another international match.<ref>{{cite web|title=1987: Canada, USSR brawl at World Junior Hockey Tournament|publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]|url=http://www.cbc.ca/archives/entry/1987-punch-up-in-piestany|access-date=18 June 2016}}</ref> A book by Gare Joyce was written regarding the event.<ref name="Joyce">{{Citation|surname=Joyce|given=Gare|year=2006|title=When the Lights Went Out|publisher=Random House|isbn=978-0-385-66275-8}}</ref>
* February 9, 2001 – A game between the [[Nottingham Panthers]] and the [[Sheffield Steelers]] in the British [[Ice Hockey Superleague|Superleague]] saw "one of the worst scenes of violence seen at a British ice hockey rink".  When Sheffield enforcer [[Dennis Vial]] crosschecked Nottingham forward Greg Hadden, Panthers enforcer [[Barry Nieckar]] subsequently fought with Vial which eventually escalated into a 36-man bench-clearing brawl. Referee Moray Hanson sent both teams to their locker rooms and delayed the game for 45&nbsp;minutes while tempers cooled and the officials sorted out the penalties. Eight players and both coaches were ejected, and a British record total of 404 penalty minutes were incurred during the second period. The league handed out 30 games in suspensions to four players and Steelers coach Mike Blaisdell and a total of £8,400 in fines.<ref>{{cite news| author = BBC | title = Brawl taints Panthers' victory | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/1163606.stm | access-date = 2006-12-29 |publisher=BBC | date=February 10, 2001}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| author = CBC | title = British league suspends Canadian hockey brawlers | url = http://www.cbc.ca/sports/story/2001/02/14/brawlers010214.html | access-date = 2007-12-24 |publisher = CBC | date=February 14, 2001}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/other_sports/1171302.stm |title=League punishes teams over brawl |date=February 15, 2001 |work=BBC Sport |access-date=November 29, 2011}}</ref>
