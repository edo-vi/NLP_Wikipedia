'''Theia''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|θ|iː|ə}}) is a [[List of hypothetical Solar System objects|hypothesized]] ancient [[planet]] in the [[Formation and evolution of the Solar System|early Solar System]] that, according to the [[giant-impact hypothesis]], collided with the [[early Earth]] around 4.5 billion years ago, with some of the resulting ejected debris gathering to form the [[Moon]].<ref name="agerefinement">{{cite web |last1=Wolpert |first1=Stuart |date=January 12, 2017 |title=UCLA Study Shows the Moon is Older Than Previously Thought |url=https://scitechdaily.com/ucla-study-shows-the-moon-is-older-than-previously-thought/ |access-date=23 March 2022 |website=scitechdaily.com |publisher=UCLA}}</ref><ref name="TheiaPothesis"/> 
Such a collision, with the two planets' cores and mantles fusing, could explain why [[Earth's core]] is larger than expected for a body its size. Collision simulations support the idea that the [[large low-shear-velocity provinces]] in the lower mantle may be remnants of Theia.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/nov/01/blobs-near-earths-core-are-remnants-of-collision-with-another-planet-study-says|title=Blobs near Earth's core are remnants of collision with another planet, study says |first1=Ian|last1=Sample|date=November 1, 2023|work=[[The Guardian]]}}</ref><ref name="NYT-20231101" /> Theia is hypothesized to have been about the size of [[Mars]], and may have formed in the [[outer Solar System]] and [[Origin of water on Earth|provided much of Earth's water]].

==Name==
In [[Greek mythology]], [[Theia]] was one of the [[Titans]]. She was the mother of [[Selene]], the goddess of the Moon,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Murdin|first1=Paul|title=Rock Legends: The Asteroids and Their Discoverers|date=2016|publisher=Springer|isbn=9783319318363|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-31836-3|page=178|bibcode=2016rlat.book.....M |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QDusDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA178}}</ref> a story that parallels the planet Theia's theorized role in creating the Moon.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/Selene | title=Selene &#124; Origin and meaning of selene by Online Etymology Dictionary}}</ref>

==Orbit==
Theia is hypothesized to have orbited in the [[Lagrange point#L4 and L5|L<sub>4</sub> or L<sub>5</sub>]] configuration presented by the Earth–Sun system, where it would tend to remain. If this were the case it might have grown to a size comparable to [[Mars]], with a diameter of about {{convert|6,102|km|mi|abbr=off}}.{{citation needed|date=December 2022}} [[Perturbation (astronomy)|Gravitational perturbations]] by [[Venus]] could have put it onto a collision course with the early Earth.<ref name="Stereo"/>

==Collision==
[[File:Big Splash Theia.gif|upright=1.2|Animation of collision between Earth (blue) and Theia (black), forming the Moon (red and gray). Bodies are not to scale.|thumb]]

According to the [[Giant-impact hypothesis|giant impact hypothesis]], Theia orbited the [[Sun]], nearly along the orbit of the [[proto-Earth]], by staying close to one or the other of the Sun-Earth system's two more stable [[Lagrangian point]]s (''i.e.'', either L<sub>4</sub> or L<sub>5</sub>).<ref name="Stereo"/> Theia was eventually [[Perturbation (astronomy)|perturbed]] away from that relationship by the gravitational influence of [[Jupiter]], [[Venus]], or both, resulting in a collision between Theia and Earth.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

Computer simulations suggest that Theia was traveling no faster than {{cvt|4|km/s|km/h}} when it struck Earth at an estimated 45-degree angle.{{citation needed|date=October 2023}}

Initially, the hypothesis supposed that Theia had struck Earth with a glancing blow<ref name="ReuferMeier2012"/> and ejected many pieces of both the [[proto-Earth]] and Theia, those pieces either forming one body that became the Moon or forming two moons that eventually merged to form the Moon.<ref name="JutziAsphaug2011"/><ref name=Astronomy>"Faceoff! The Moon's oddly different sides", ''[[Astronomy (magazine)|Astronomy]]'', August 2014, 44–49.</ref> Such accounts assumed that a head-on impact would have destroyed both planets, creating a short-lived second [[asteroid belt]] between the orbits of Venus and Mars.

In contrast, evidence published in January 2016 suggests that the impact was indeed a head-on collision and that Theia's remains are on Earth and the Moon.<ref name="Nace2016"/><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Young |first1=E.

==Hypotheses==
{{main|Origin of the Moon}}
From the beginning of modern astronomy, there have been at least four hypotheses for the origin of the Moon:
# A single body split into Earth and Moon
# The Moon was captured by Earth's gravity (as most of the [[Outer planet|outer planets]]' smaller moons were captured)
# The Earth and Moon formed at the same time when the [[protoplanetary disk]] [[accretion (astrophysics)|accreted]]
# The Theia-impact scenario described above

The lunar rock samples retrieved by [[Apollo program|Apollo]] [[List of Apollo astronauts|astronauts]] were found to be very similar in composition to Earth's crust, and so were likely removed from Earth in some violent event.<ref name="Nace2016"/><ref name="HerwartzPack2014"/><ref name="MeierReufer2014"/>

By 2012, theories found Theia could explain why [[Earth's core]] is larger than expected for a body its size; Theia's core and mantle could have fused with those of Earth.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20121121040559/http://www.seti.org/node/1458 "A New Model for the Origin of the Moon"]. ''SETI Institute''.</ref> It is also hypothesized that the [[large low-shear-velocity provinces]] detected deep in Earth's mantle may be fragments of Theia.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Yuan |first1=Qian |last2=Li |first2=Mingming |last3=Desch |first3=Steven J. |last4=Ko |first4=Byeongkwan |date=2021 |title=Giant impact origin for the large low shear velocity provinces |url=https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2021/pdf/1980.pdf |journal=52nd Lunar and Planetary Science Conference |access-date=27 March 2021}}</ref><ref>[https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20220510-why-are-there-continent-sized-blobs-in-the-deep-earth Why are there continent-sized 'blobs' in the deep Earth?], [[BBC Future]], by Zaria Gorvett, 12 May 2022</ref> In 2023, computer simulations reinforced that hypothesis.<ref name="NYT-20231101">{{cite news |last=Chang |first=Kenneth |title=A ‘Big Whack’ Formed the Moon and Left Traces Deep in Earth, a Study Suggests - Two enormous blobs deep inside Earth could be remnants of the birth of the moon. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/01/science/moon-formation-theia.html |date=1 November 2023 |work=[[The New York Times]] |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://archive.ph/X5L2h |archivedate=1 November 2023 |accessdate=2 November 2023 }}</ref><ref name="NAT-20231101">{{cite journal |author=Yuan, Qian |display-authors=et al.|title=Moon-forming impactor as a source of Earth’s basal mantle anomalies |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06589-1 |date=1 November 2023 |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=623 |pages=95-99 |doi=10.1038/s41586-023-06589-1 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://archive.ph/PXX5r |archivedate=2 November 2023 |accessdate=2 November 2023 }}</ref>
