{{Short description|Geological unit of time; one thousand years}}
{{Lowercase}}
The abbreviation '''kyr''' means "thousand years".

kyr was formerly common in some [[English language]] works, especially in [[geology]] and [[astronomy]], for the [[physical unit|unit]] of 1,000 years or [[millennium]]. The "k" is the [[SI prefix|unit prefix]] for [[kilo-]] or thousand with the suffix "yr" simply an abbreviation for "year".

Occasionally, the "k" is shown in [[upper case]], as in "100 Kyr"; this is an incorrect usage.  "kyr" itself is often considered incorrect, with some preferring to use "ky".

[[ISO 80000-3]] recommends usage of ka (for [[kiloannum]]), which avoids the implicit English bias of "year" by using a [[Latin]] root.
