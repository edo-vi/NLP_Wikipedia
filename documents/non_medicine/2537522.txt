[[Charles Darwin]] and [[Alfred Russel Wallace|Alfred Wallace]] independently formulated the theory of [[evolution]] by [[natural selection]], which was described in detail in Darwin's book ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'', which was published in 1859. In it, Darwin proposed that the features of all living things, including humans, were shaped by natural processes of descent with accumulated modification leading to divergence over long periods of time. The theory of evolution in its current form affects almost all areas of biology.<ref>{{cite journal | last1=Dobzhansky | first1=Theodosius | year=1964 | title=Biology, Molecular and Organismic | url=http://people.ibest.uidaho.edu/~bree/courses/1_Dobzhansky_1964.pdf | journal=American Zoologist | volume=4 | issue=4 | pages=443–452 | doi=10.1093/icb/4.4.443 | pmid=14223586 | access-date=5 February 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303220935/http://people.ibest.uidaho.edu/~bree/courses/1_Dobzhansky_1964.pdf | archive-date=3 March 2016 | url-status=dead | df=dmy-all | doi-access=free }}</ref> Separately, [[Gregor Mendel]] formulated in the principles of inheritance in 1866, which became the basis of modern [[genetics]].

==Education==
An [[Undergraduate education|undergraduate]] degree in biology typically requires coursework in [[molecular biology|molecular]] and [[Cell biology|cellular biology]], [[Developmental biology|development]], [[ecology]], [[genetics]], [[microbiology]], [[anatomy]], [[physiology]], [[botany]], and [[zoology]].<ref name="hammenetal1990"/><ref name = "cheesman2007">{{cite journal | last1 = Cheesman | first1 = Kerry | last2 = French | first2 = Donald | last3 = Cheesman | first3 = Ian | last4 = Swails | first4 = Nancy | last5 = Thomas | first5 = Jerry | title = Is There Any Common Curriculum for Undergraduate Biology Majors in the 21st Century? | journal = BioScience | volume = 57 | issue = 6 | pages = 516–522 | date = 2007 | doi = 10.1641/B570609| doi-access = free }}</ref> Additional requirements may include [[physics]], [[chemistry]] ([[General chemistry|general]], [[Organic chemistry|organic]], and [[biochemistry]]), [[calculus]], and [[statistics]].

Students who aspire to a research-oriented career usually pursue a graduate degree such as a master’s or a doctorate (e.g., PhD) whereby they would receive training from a research head based on an apprenticeship model that has been in existence since the 1800s.<ref name="gould2015"/> Students in these graduate programs often receive specialized training in a particular subdiscipline of biology.<ref name="nurse2015"/>

==Research==
[[File:Martinus Willem Beijerinck in the lab in 1921.jpg|thumb|[[Martinus Willem Beijerinck]], a botanist and microbiologist]]
Biologists who work in basic research formulate theories and devise experiments to advance human knowledge on life including topics such as [[evolution]], [[biochemistry]], [[molecular biology]], [[neuroscience]] and [[cell biology]].

Biologists typically conduct laboratory experiments involving [[animal]]s, [[plant]]s, [[microorganism]]s or [[biomolecule]]s. However, a small part of biological research also occurs outside the laboratory and may involve natural observation rather than experimentation. For example, a botanist may investigate the plant species present in a particular environment, while an ecologist might study how a forest area recovers after a fire.

Biologists who work in applied research use instead the accomplishments gained by basic research to further knowledge in particular fields or applications. For example, this applied research may be used to develop new [[pharmaceutical drug]]s, treatments and medical [[diagnostic test]]s. Biological scientists conducting applied research and product development in private industry may be required to describe their research plans or results to non-scientists who are in a position to veto or approve their ideas. These scientists must consider the business effects of their work.

Swift advances in knowledge of genetics and organic molecules spurred growth in the field of biotechnology, transforming the industries in which biological scientists work. Biological scientists can now manipulate the genetic material of animals and plants, attempting to make organisms (including humans) more productive or resistant to disease. Basic and applied research on biotechnological processes, such as recombining DNA, has led to the production of important substances, including human insulin and growth hormone. Many other substances not previously available in large quantities are now produced by biotechnological means. Some of these substances are useful in treating diseases.

Those working on various genome (chromosomes with their associated genes) projects isolate genes and determine their function. This work continues to lead to the discovery of genes associated with specific diseases and inherited health risks, such as sickle cell anemia. Advances in biotechnology have created research opportunities in almost all areas of biology, with commercial applications in areas such as medicine, agriculture, and [[environmental remediation]].

===Specializations===
Most biological scientists specialize in the study of a certain type of organism or in a specific activity, although recent advances have blurred some traditional classifications.{{why|provide explanation of this and sources|date=October 2013}}
* [[Geneticist]]s study [[genetics]], the science of [[genes]], [[heredity]], and [[Genetic variation|variation]] of [[organism]]s.
* [[Neuroscientist]]s study the [[nervous system]].
* [[Developmental biology|Developmental biologists]] study the process of development and growth of [[organism]]s
* [[Biochemist]]s study the chemical composition of living things. They analyze the complex chemical combinations and reactions involved in [[metabolism]], [[reproduction]], and growth.
* [[Molecular biology|Molecular biologists]] study the [[biological activity]] between [[biomolecule]]s.
* [[Microbiologist]]s investigate the growth and characteristics of microscopic organisms such as [[bacteria]], [[algae]], or [[Fungus|fungi]].
* [[Physiology|Physiologists]] study life functions of plants and animals,  in the whole organism and at the cellular or molecular level, under normal and abnormal conditions. Physiologists often specialize in functions such as growth, reproduction, [[photosynthesis]], respiration, or movement, or in the physiology of a certain area or system of the organism.
* [[Biophysics|Biophysicists]] use experimental methods traditionally employed in [[physics]] to answer biological questions .
* [[Computational biology|Computational biologists]] apply the techniques of [[computer science]], [[applied mathematics]] and [[statistics]] to address biological problems. The main focus lies on developing [[mathematical modeling]] and computational simulation techniques. By these means it addresses scientific research topics with their theoretical and experimental questions without a laboratory.
* [[Zoology|Zoologists]] and [[Wildlife biologist|wildlife biologists]] study animals and wildlife—their origin, behavior, diseases, and life processes. Some experiment with live animals in controlled or natural surroundings, while others dissect dead animals to study their structure. Zoologists and wildlife biologists also may collect and analyze biological data to determine the environmental effects of current and potential uses of land and water areas. Zoologists usually are identified by the animal group they study. For example, [[ornithology|ornithologists]] study [[bird]]s, [[mammalogy|mammalogists]] study [[mammal]]s, [[herpetology|herpetologists]] study [[reptile]]s and [[amphibian]]s, [[ichthyology|ichthyologists]] study [[fish]], [[cnidariologist]]s study [[jellyfish]]es and [[entomologist]]s study insects.
* [[Botany|Botanists]] study plants and their environments. Some study all aspects of plant life, including [[algae]], [[lichen]]s, [[moss]]es, [[fern]]s, [[Pinophyta|conifers]], and [[flowering plant]]s; others specialize in areas such as identification and classification of plants, the structure and function of plant parts, the biochemistry of plant processes, the causes and cures of plant diseases, the interaction of plants with other organisms and the environment, the geological record of plants and their evolution.  [[Mycology|Mycologists]] study [[fungi]], such as [[yeasts]], [[Mold (fungus)|mold]] and [[mushrooms]], which are a separate kingdom from plants.
* Aquatic biologists study micro-organisms, plants, and animals living in water. [[Marine Biology|Marine biologists]] study salt water organisms, and limnologists study [[Limnology|fresh water organisms]]. Much of the work of marine biology centers on [[molecular biology]], the study of the biochemical processes that take place inside living cells. Marine biology is a branch of [[oceanography]], which is the study of the biological, chemical, geological, and physical characteristics of oceans and the ocean floor. (See the Handbook statements on environmental scientists and hydrologists and on geoscientists.)
* [[Ecology|Ecologists]] investigate the relationships among organisms and between organisms and their environments, examining the effects of population size, pollutants, rainfall, temperature, and altitude. Using knowledge of various scientific disciplines, ecologists may collect, study, and report data on the quality of air, food, soil, and water.
* [[Evolutionary biology|Evolutionary biologists]] investigate the [[evolution|evolutionary processes]] that produced the [[Biodiversity|diversity of life]] on [[Earth]], starting from [[Last universal common ancestor|a single common ancestor]]. These processes include [[natural selection]], [[common descent]], and [[speciation]].

==Employment==
Biologists typically work regular hours but longer hours are not uncommon. Researchers may be required to work odd hours in laboratories or other locations (especially while in the field), depending on the nature of their research.

Many biologists depend on [[Grant (money)|grant money]] to fund their research. They may be under pressure to meet deadlines and to conform to rigid grant-writing specifications when preparing proposals to seek new or extended funding.

Marine biologists encounter a variety of working conditions. Some work in laboratories; others work on research ships, and those who work underwater must practice safe diving while working around sharp [[coral reef]]s and hazardous marine life. Although some marine biologists obtain their specimens from the sea, many still spend a good deal of their time in laboratories and offices, conducting tests, running experiments, recording results, and compiling data.

Biologists are not usually exposed to unsafe or unhealthy conditions. Those who work with dangerous organisms or [[Toxicity|toxic]] substances in the laboratory must follow strict [[safety]] procedures to avoid [[contamination]]. Many biological scientists, such as botanists, ecologists, and zoologists, conduct field studies that involve strenuous physical activity and primitive living conditions. Biological scientists in the field may work in warm or cold climates, in all kinds of [[weather]].

==Honors and awards==
The highest honor awarded to biologists is the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]], awarded since 1901, by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. Another significant award is the [[Crafoord Prize]] in Biosciences; established in 1980.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.kva.se/en/priser/crafoordpriset/crafoord-om-priset|title=About the Crafoord Prize - The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences|website=www.kva.se|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180118204251/http://www.kva.se/en/priser/crafoordpriset/crafoord-om-priset|archive-date=18 January 2018|url-status=live|access-date=2017-07-04|df=dmy-all}}</ref>
