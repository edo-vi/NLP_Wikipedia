'''Fictional portrayals of psychopaths''', or '''sociopaths''', are some of the most notorious in film and literature but may only vaguely or partly relate to the concept of [[psychopathy]], which is itself used with varying definitions by [[mental health professional]]s, [[criminologist]]s and others. The character may be identified as a diagnosed/assessed psychopath or sociopath within the fictional work itself, or by its creator when discussing their intentions with the work, which might be distinguished from opinions of audiences or [[critic]]s based only on a character appearing to show traits or behaviors associated with an undefined popular stereotype of psychopathy.

Such characters are often portrayed in an [[exaggeration|exaggerated]] fashion and typically in the role of a [[villain]] or [[antihero]], where the general characteristics of a psychopath are useful to facilitate conflict and danger. Because the definitions and criteria in the [[history of psychopathy]] have varied over the years and continue to change even now, many characters in notable films may have been designed to fall under the category of a psychopath at the time of the film's production or release, but not necessarily in subsequent years. There are several [[stereotypical]] images of psychopathy in both lay and professional accounts which only partly overlap and can involve contradictory traits: the charming [[con artist]], the deranged [[serial killer]], the successful [[Psychopathy in the workplace|corporate psychopath]], or the chronic low-level [[crime|offender]] with [[juvenile delinquency]]. The public concept reflects some combination of fear of the mythical [[bogeyman]], fascination with human [[evil]], and sometimes perhaps [[envy]] of people who might appear to go through life unencumbered by the same levels of [[Guilt (emotion)|guilt]], [[anguish]] or [[Emotional security|insecurity]].<ref name="gap">{{cite journal |last=Skeem|first=J.

==19th century==
In the 19th century the diagnostic categories of [[monomania]] or [[moral insanity]] (the word 'moral' then meant either emotional or ethical) made their way into works of literature, covering numerous eccentricities, obsessions or breakdowns—and sometimes acts of apparently senseless criminality, occasionally violent. This period also saw the rise of [[crime fiction]] such as [[sensation novels]], where often someone in a local community who appeared normal would turn out to be criminally insane, and [[detective novels]], playing on increasing anxieties about the characters of people in the newly expanding and diversifying industrial cities.<ref name=Thesing>{{cite book |title=A companion to the Victorian novel |author=Patrick Brantlinger, William B.

Nevertheless, an early rise to prominence followed its use in a Russian trial between 1883 and 1885 concerning a child murder, contributing to the release of a probable false confessor while the original suspect was found guilty. 'Psychopaths' began to appear in [[vaudeville]]s, ditties (songs) and press articles. The psychopathy defense was reported internationally as having enabled a remorseless female child killer to go free, a usage still quoted in dictionaries today.<ref>[[Oxford English Dictionary]] 2011: Psychopath: 1885 Pall Mall G. 21 Jan.

[[Social degeneration|'Degenerates']] were also depicted in popular fiction of the 19th through to mid 20th century, sometimes in similar ways to the modern usages of the concept of psychopaths, sometimes being cited as a cause of psychopathy. The concept fell into disrepute due partly to its use by the Nazis to justify eradicating their opposition.<ref name=Jalava>[http://summit.sfu.ca/item/8120 Science of conscience: Metaphysics, morality, and rhetoric in psychopathy research] Jarkko Jalava, 2007, PhD at Simon Fraser University, then Professor at Okanagan College, Canada</ref>

==20th century==
===Early 20th century===
The meaning gradually narrowed, initially as 'psychopathic inferiors' covering all of what today might be called [[personality disorders]] and various other conditions, then intertwining with the terminology of the 'sociopath' (and eventually [[antisocial personality disorder]]), though psychopathy remained variously defined in both broad and narrow ways.

Early representations of psychopaths in film were often caricatured as sadistic, unpredictable, sexually depraved, and emotionally unstable ([[mania|manic]]) characters with a compulsion to engage in random violence and destruction, usually with a series of bizarre mannerisms such as giggling, laughing, or facial [[tics]]. Up until the late 1950s, cinematic conventions usually relegated the psychopath to roles of genre villains such as gangsters, [[mad scientists]], [[supervillains]], and many types of generic criminals. Examples of this type are [[Pinkie Brown]] ([[Richard Attenborough]]) in ''[[Brighton Rock (1947 film)|Brighton Rock]]'', Tommy Udo ([[Richard Widmark]]) in ''[[Kiss of Death (1947 film)|Kiss of Death]]'', Cody Jarrett ([[James Cagney]]) in ''[[White Heat (film)|White Heat]]'', and Antonio 'Tony' Camonte ([[Paul Muni]]) in the 1932 version of ''[[Scarface (1932 film)|Scarface]]''. [[Homosexuals]] were also referred to as psychopaths under the broad definition then in use; the [[American Psychiatric Association]] in the first ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' in 1952 would list it under 'sociopathic personality disturbance'.

One exceptional depiction in this period was the character of child murderer Hans Beckert ([[Peter Lorre]]) in the 1931 [[Fritz Lang]] film ''[[M (1931 film)|M]]''. Lorre portrays Beckert as an outwardly unremarkable man tormented by a compulsion to ritualistically murder children. A German film (allegedly based on the real life [[serial killer]] [[Peter Kürten]]), it was released in America in 1933 and has been seen as indicative of a turning point in American media depictions of psychopaths. Until the 1930s psychiatrists typically applied the diagnosis to unemployed males or 'hypersexual' women, but several psychiatric, cultural and economic trends, together with [[sex crime]] panics, converged to transform the popular psychopath into a violent, male, sexual deviant or criminal—a threat to innocence, [[gender role]]s and the [[social order]].<ref>[https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/1908506?uid=3738032&uid=2129&uid=2&uid=70&uid=4&sid=21102561687811 "Uncontrolled Desires": The Response to the Sexual Psychopath, 1920-1960] Estelle B.

===Mid 20th century===
One of the earliest real life cases which had a pervasive influence on American movies was that of [[Ed Gein]], arrested in 1957. A farmer who had resided with his mother until her death, he had then killed two women and dug up female bodies from the local [[cemetery]], making various items out of their skin. Rumours spread that he was also a [[necrophiliac]], [[cannibal]] or [[transvestite]], though these appear to have been unsupported other than by brief affirmations from Gein to [[leading questions]] by interrogators.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=Z_ZDUR7H_QMC Deviant] Harold Schechter, 1998, Pg 192, 238</ref><ref>[http://www.robertcdaniels.com/ed_gein.htm#_ftn2 Ed Gein: the Cannibal Myth Exposed]</ref> Gein was found mentally ill and legally insane before trial, deemed to have had [[schizophrenia]] (psychosis including [[delusions]] and [[hallucinations]]) for at least 12 years, though at least one media psychiatrist dubbed him instead a 'sexual psychopath'.<ref>Gonyea, Floyd.

At the end of the film, a psychiatrist describes Bates as having a split personality. [[Multiple personality disorder]] was at that time very popular (cf 1957 movie ''[[The Three Faces of Eve]]'') and is to this day commonly confused with [[schizophrenia]]. Bloch later wrote a script for the 1966 film ''[[The Psychopath (1966 film)|The Psychopath]]'', the original working title for which was "Schizo".<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.britmovie.co.uk/films/The-Psychopath_1966 |title=The Psychopath – 1966: Plot Synopsis |access-date=2013-08-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140306042939/http://www.britmovie.co.uk/films/The-Psychopath_1966 |archive-date=2014-03-06 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

A different thread within fictional portrayals of psychopathy continued to focus on rebelliously antisocial characters. The title of the 1955 film ''[[Rebel Without a Cause]]'', starring [[James Dean]], came from a 1944 book of the same name detailing the [[hypnosis|hypno]]-[[Psychoanalysis|analysis]] of a diagnosed psychopath. In the book, psychiatrist [[Robert M. Lindner]] also discussed psychopaths in general as pointlessly selfish individuals who appear unable to accept society's rules. In [[Ken Kesey]]'s 1962 novel ''[[One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (novel)|One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest]]'', [[Randle McMurphy]], after being admitted to a mental institution, is repeatedly referred to by the authorities, other patients and himself as a possible or definite psychopath. He reads from his record: "repeated outbreaks of passion that suggest the possible diagnosis of psychopath", and adds that a doctor told him it means "I fight and fuh-pardon me, ladies-means I am he put it overzealous in my sexual relations." The current doctor then reads out the note: "Don't overlook the possibility that this man might be feigning psychosis".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/one-flew-over-cuckoos-nest/quotes|title=One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest Quotes|work=Shmoop}}</ref> In the script for the popular [[One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (film)|film adaptation]] in 1975, only the latter is retained and the term psychopath is never used. Ironically, the main authority figure in the hospital—the cold, [[sadistic personality disorder|sadistic]] [[Nurse Ratched]]—was later described as a psychopath under later understandings of the term.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=LBIjsk-2ok4C The Psychopath in Film] 1999 By Wayne Wilson.

American mystery author [[Patricia Highsmith]] often featured psychopathic characters in her books, most notably her ''[[Ripliad]]'' series about [[Tom Ripley]], a "suave, agreeable and utterly amoral" con artist and serial killer. In the first book, 1955's ''[[The Talented Mr. Ripley]]'', Ripley murders a rich man and steals his identity; in four subsequent novels, he commits several murders and engages in a long-running art forgery scam, all without getting caught. Ripley has been described by several critics as a psychopath,<ref>{{cite web|first=Sam|last=Jordison|title=Tom Ripley, the likable psychopath|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jun/02/tom-ripley-the-likable-psychopath-patricia-highsmith|work=[[The Guardian]]|location=London, England|date=June 2, 2015|access-date=March 18, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first=Michael|last=Dirda|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/22797|title=This Woman is Dangerous|work=[[New York Review of Books]]|publisher=[[New York Review Books]]|location=New York City|volume=56|number=11|date=July 2, 2009|access-date=March 6, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|first=John|last=Gray|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-22551083|title=A Point of View: Tom Ripley and the meaning of evil|website=[[BBC]]|location=London, England|date=17 May 2013}}</ref> while author and diagnosed [[narcissistic personality disorder|narcissist]] [[Sam Vaknin]] has said that Ripley fits the criteria for both psychopathy and narcissism.<ref>{{cite book|first=Sam|last=Vaknin|author-link=Sam Vaknin|title=Malignant Self-Love: Narcissism Revisited|url=http://samvak.tripod.com/talent.html|publisher=Narcissus Publishing|location=Rheinbeck, New York|date=2003|isbn=978-8023833843|access-date=December 6, 2014}}</ref>

===Late 20th century===
The 1973 film ''[[Badlands (film)|Badlands]]'' involved two lead characters based loosely on [[Charles Starkweather]] and [[Caril Ann Fugate]]. While the male protagonist, [[spree killer]] Kit Carruthers ([[Martin Sheen]]), is sometimes described as a psychopath or sociopath, psychologist [[Robert D. Hare]], a leading proponent of the assessment of psychopathy, has identified his girlfriend and accomplice Holly ([[Sissy Spacek]]) as exemplifying his concept of a psychopath due to her poor emotional sense of the meaning of events and her attempted mask of normality. However, writer and director [[Terrence Malick]] has said he considered Kit's shallow, bitter insensitivity to be a result of suffering and neglect growing up in the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]], and 15-year-old Holly, though immature and mis-estimating her audience, to be a quite typical [[Southern United States|Southern]] girl wanting to help narrate and come off well but still give the hard facts, and not dwell on herself or on personal tragedies.<ref>{{cite book|first=Robert D.|last=Hare|author-link=Robert D.

The increasing media focus of serial killers in the late 20th century, fueled by cases such as [[John Wayne Gacy]] (1978), [[Ted Bundy]] (1978) and [[Jeffrey Dahmer]] (1991), lent an additional momentum to the way psychopathy was both perceived and portrayed in film and literature, sometimes incorporating a hybrid of traditional psychopaths from early film and late-19th century literature with the high-functioning behaviors detected in some serial killers.<ref>[https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc3228/m2/1/high_res_d/thesis.pdf Serial Killing Myths Versus Reality: A Content Analysis of Serial Killer Movies Made Between 1980 and 2001] Sarah Scott McCready, Masters Thesis, 2002</ref><ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1542-734X.1995.1801_87.x | volume=18 | issue=1 | title=Consuming Cannibals: Psychopathic Killers as Archetypes and Cultural Icons | year=1995 | journal=The Journal of American Culture | pages=87–96 | last1 = Grixti | first1 = Joseph| s2cid=145356571 }}</ref>

The psychiatrist and [[cannibalism|cannibalistic]] serial killer [[Hannibal Lecter]], most notably portrayed by [[Anthony Hopkins]] in the [[Academy Award]]-winning 1991 film ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|The Silence of the Lambs]]'', is perhaps the most infamous fictional psychopath of the 20th century. Lecter is intelligent and sophisticated and his disarming charisma and wit disguise his true nature as a serial killer. He spends most of the film in a cell, taunting FBI trainee [[Clarice Starling]] with clues to the identity of another serial killer, [[Buffalo Bill (The Silence of the Lambs)|Buffalo Bill]], in exchange for intimate details of Starling's troubled childhood. Lecter first appeared in [[Thomas Harris]]'  1981 novel ''[[Red Dragon (novel)|Red Dragon]]'', in which he is characterized as not fitting any known psychological profile. In the film adaptation of ''The Silence of the Lambs'', he is referred to as a "pure psychopath".<ref>In ''[[Red Dragon (novel)|Red Dragon]]'' and its first film adaptation, ''[[Manhunter (film)|Manhunter]]'', FBI profiler [[Will Graham (fictional character)|Will Graham]] suggests that psychologists "say he's a sociopath" because they "don't know what else to call him". Shortly afterwards in ''Red Dragon'', Lecter's jailer [[Frederick Chilton]] says "...we thought he might provide us with a singular opportunity to study a pure sociopath...As it turned out, I don't think we're any closer to understanding him now than the day he came in." In the script for the film version of ''The Silence of the Lambs'', the same character calls Lecter a "pure psychopath". In the novel of the same name, FBI agent [[Jack Crawford (character)|Jack Crawford]] tells Starling "I'm waist-deep in inaccessible patient evaluations of Dr. Lecter and they're all different" and Chilton later tells Starling "A pure sociopath, that's obviously what he is. But he's impenetrable, much too sophisticated for the standard tests."</ref> In the later novels ''[[Hannibal (Harris novel)|Hannibal]]'' and ''[[Hannibal Rising]]'', Lecter's psychopathy is portrayed as the result of seeing his sister Mischa murdered and cannibalized during [[World War II]]. In 2013 Harris revealed that he originally based the Lecter character on Alfredo Ballí Trevino, a Mexican physician who had killed and dismembered his [[homosexual]] lover, in what was called a [[crime of passion]] over a financial dispute.<ref>{{cite news|first=Umberto|last=Bacchi|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/articles/495908/20130731/hannibal-lecter-gay-mexican-doctor-alfredo-ball.htm|title=Real Hannibal Lecter was Murderous Gay Mexican Doctor Alfredo Ballí Treviño|newspaper=[[International Business Times]]|date=July 31, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first=Maria G.|last=Valdez|url=http://www.latintimes.com/articles/6867/20130730/real-hannibal-lecter-gay-mexican-doctor-alfredo-balli-trevino-inspiration-thomas-harris-silence-lambs-25-anniversary.htm|title=Who Was The Real Hannibal Lecter?|newspaper=[[Latin Times]]|date=July 30, 2013}}</ref>

The novel ''[[American Psycho]]'' tells the story of [[Patrick Bateman]], a [[yuppie]] serial killer working on [[Wall Street]] in the 1980s. It was made into a [[American Psycho (film)|film]] in 2000. Author [[Bret Easton Ellis]] has told interviewers that the book is a satire on shallow [[consumerist]] lifestyles, but also that the writing of the violent scenes was based on fictional horror and FBI material on serial killers, along with how he imagined "a psychotic who worked on Wall Street" would describe such incidents. Some commentary, including in scientific journals, has suggested the Bateman character appears to be a psychopath. However, Bateman also exhibits signs of psychosis such as hallucinations, and as such appears to be an [[unreliable narrator]]; it is left ambiguous whether Bateman is actually a serial killer, or is merely hallucinating about committing murder.<ref>[http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/6127/the-art-of-fiction-no-216-bret-easton-ellis Bret Easton Ellis, The Art of Fiction]  No. 216.

In the 1993 book ''[[Girl, Interrupted]]'' and its 1999 [[Girl, Interrupted (film)|film adaptation]], the character of Lisa (played by [[Angelina Jolie]] in the film) is a rebellious, antisocial young woman who is diagnosed as a sociopath.<ref>[http://college.cengage.com/psychology/resources/students/screen/screen_20000110.html Girl, Interrupted—Cuckoo's Nest Redux] By Elaine Cassel, 2000</ref> However, it is left ambiguous whether that diagnosis is accurate.

The 1996 film ''[[Primal Fear (film)|Primal Fear]]'' depicts a suspected murderer who appears to have [[multiple personality disorder]], who at the end reveals that he has been faking the disorder. In the original novel by [[William Diehl]], the psychiatrist Molly Arrington and others repeatedly explain psychopathy and psychosis as if they are the same, inherently antisocial, condition.

''[[Harry Potter]]'' author [[J. K. Rowling]] has described [[Lord Voldemort]], the series' main villain, as "a raging psychopath, devoid of the normal human responses to other people's suffering, and there ARE people like that in the world".<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://ew.com/books/2000/08/04/jk-rowling-harry-potter-and-goblet-fire/|author=Jensen, Jeff. |title=J.K.

Tana French's 2007 novel [[In the Woods]] depicts two detectives who work to hunt down child murderess Rosalind Devlin. Upon discovery, it is remarked that Devlin is a psychopath who is incapable of emotional attachment and feigns vulnerability to better manipulate people.

[[Anton Chigurh]], the primary antagonist of the novel [[No Country for Old Men (novel)|No Country for Old Men]], is described as a "psychopathic killer." He is a relentless hitman who pursues protagonist Lewelyn Moss in order to recover two million in missing drug money. Chigurh kills almost everyone he meets and displays no empathy or conventional morals. He adheres to a warped series of principals and occasionally decides his victims fates with the flip of a coin. The [[No Country for Old Men|film]] version of the character, portrayed by [[Javier Bardem]], was rated by psychologists as the most accurate depiction of a psychopath.
