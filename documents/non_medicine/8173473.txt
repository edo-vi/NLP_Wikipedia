==Description==
Gram-positive, nonmotile and strongly acid-fast rods (3-5&nbsp;µm long). Slightly rounded ends.

'''Colony characteristics'''
*Rough [[nonchromogenic]] colonies.

'''Physiology'''
*Growth on inspissated 1% egg yolk medium at 30&nbsp;°C - 37&nbsp;°C within 4–5 weeks (using large [[inocula]], confined to a concentrated area of the medium, egg white is inhibitory).

==Pathogenesis==
*Cause of endemic disease of rats in various parts of the world, as well as [[feline leprosy]].
*[[feline leprosy]] is transmitted by bites from rats and other cats.
*Disease occurs mainly in the skin and lymph nodes, causing induration, alopecia and eventual ulceration.
*[[Nodule (medicine)|Nodular]] lesions, involving [[subcutaneous tissues]], may be solitary or multiple and usually confined to the head region or the limbs.  Nodules are fleshy and freely movable.
*Surgical excision of the lesions is the preferred treatment.
*Only the densely and uniformly stained forms appear to be infectious for animals, in contrast to the degenerate unevenly stained forms.
*[[Biosafety level]] 2

==Type strain==
None specified due to difficulties in cultivation.
