[[File:Sediment in the Gulf of Mexico (2).jpg|thumb|377x377px|The Gulf of Mexico, which contains a significant nepheloid layer]]A '''nepheloid layer''' or '''nepheloid zone''' is a layer of water in the [[Deep sea|deep ocean]] basin, above the [[ocean floor]], that contains significant amounts of suspended [[sediment]].<ref>Glossary of Geology, 5th Edition (American Geological Institute)</ref> It is from 200 to 1000 m thick. The name comes from [[Greek language|Greek]]: ''nephos'', "cloud". The particles in the layer may come from the upper ocean layers and from stripping the sediments from the ocean floor by currents.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last=Hunkins|first=Kenneth|last2=Thorndike|first2=Edward|last3=Mathieu|first3=Guy|date=1969|title=Nepheloid layers and bottom currents in the Arctic Ocean|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research|volume=74|issue=28|pages=6995–7008|doi=10.1029/JC074i028p06995|bibcode=1969JGR....74.6995H}}</ref> Its thickness depends on bottom current velocity and is a result of balance between [[Radiative levitation|gravitational settling]] of particles and turbulence of the current. The formation mechanisms of nepheloid layers may vary, but primarily depend on deep ocean convection. Nepheloid layers can impact the accuracy of instruments when measuring [[bathymetry]] as well as affect the types of marine life in an area. There are several significant examples of nepheloid layers across the globe, including within the [[Gulf of Mexico]] and the [[Porcupine Bank]].

== Formation mechanisms ==
A '''surface nepheloid layer''' ('''SNL''') may be created, due to particle flotation, while '''intermediate nepheloid layers''' ('''INL''') may be formed at the slopes of the ocean bed due to the dynamics of [[internal wave]]s. These intermediate nepheloid layers are derived from '''bottom nepheloid layers (BNL)''' after the layers become detached and spread along [[isopycnal]] surfaces.<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal|last=Pak|first=Hasong|last2=Zaneveld|first2=J.

[[Open ocean convection]] has a prominent effect on the distribution of nepheloid layers and their ability to form in certain areas of the ocean, such as the northern [[Atlantic Ocean]] and the northwestern [[Mediterranean Sea]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Madron|first=X.

Convection currents that disturb areas of the ocean floor such as those that circulate via [[ocean gyre]]s also affect the concentration and relative sizes of the suspended sediments, and by extension the area's corresponding [[Biotic component|biotic]] activity.

== Impacts ==

=== Bathymetry ===
The existence of the nepheloid layer complicates [[Bathymetry|bathymetric]] measurements: one has to take into account the reflections of [[lidar]] or [[Ultrasound|ultrasonic]] pulses from the upper interface of this layer, as well as their absorption within the layer.<ref name=":1" /> Interference from the thick layers of suspended sediments can ultimately produce  inaccurate results concerning submarine [[topography]].

=== Marine life ===
Depending on the characteristics of a particular nepheloid layer, they can have a significant impact on marine life in the area.<ref name=":2">{{Cite journal|last=McCave|first=I. N.|date=1986|title=Local and global aspects of the bottom nepheloid layers in the world ocean|journal=Netherlands Journal of Sea Research|volume=20|issue=2|pages=167–181|doi=10.1016/0077-7579(86)90040-2|bibcode=1986NJSR...20..167M|issn=0077-7579}}</ref> The layers of sediments can block natural light, making it difficult for [[Photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] organisms to survive. In addition, the suspended particulates can harm [[Filter feeder|filter feeding]] organisms and [[plankton]] by blocking their gills or weighing them down.

== Examples ==

===Gulf of Mexico===
A prominent nepheloid layer exists in the [[Gulf of Mexico]] extending from the delta of the [[Brazos River]] to [[South Padre Island]].<ref name=":0" /> The layer of [[turbid]] water can begin as shallow as 20 meters and is caused mostly by clay run-off from multiple rivers. The silty bottom of the gulf also contributes to the high [[turbidity]]. Due to the blockage of light by this nepheloid layer, [[algae]] and [[coral]] are sparse, resulting in an animal-dominated community. This community is largely composed of [[infauna]] and consists of a [[detrital]]-based food chain.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Diercks|first=Arne-R.|last2=Dike|first2=Clayton|last3=Asper|first3=Vernon L.|last4=DiMarco|first4=Steven F.|last5=Chanton|first5=Jeffrey P.|last6=Passow|first6=Uta|date=2018|title=Scales of seafloor sediment resuspension in the northern Gulf of Mexico|journal=Elem Sci Anth|language=en|volume=6|issue=1|pages=32|doi=10.1525/elementa.285|issn=2325-1026|doi-access=free}}</ref> Many species of [[polychaete]] worms, [[Amphipod|amphipods]], and [[Brittle star|brittle stars]] inhabit the [[benthic surface]] and can also be accompanied by some secondary consumers such as [[flounders]], [[shrimp]], [[Crab|crabs]], and [[Starfish|starfishes]].

=== Porcupine Bank ===
A prominent nepheloid layer exists in the [[Porcupine Bank]].<ref>Dickson RR, McCave IN (1986) ''Nepheloid layers on the continental slope west of Porcupine Bank''. Deep Sea Res 33:791–818</ref> Geographically, the nepheloid layers are more detectable and prominent along the Porcupine Bank's western slope.<ref name=":2" /> Both the bottom and intermediate nepheloid layers form due to a myriad of factors such as [[Internal tide|internal tides]], waves, and subsequent bottom [[erosion]]. The intermediate nepheloid layer can also manifest by breaking off from the bottom layer, and the water column above the area in which the bottom nepheloid layer forms is marked by significant differences in temperature, density, and [[salinity]].
