'''Sportswashing''' is a term used to describe the practice of individuals, groups, corporations, or governments using [[Sport|sports]] to improve [[reputation]]s tarnished by wrongdoing. A form of [[propaganda]], sportswashing can be accomplished through hosting sporting events, purchasing, or [[Sponsor (commercial)|sponsoring]] sporting teams, or participating in a sport.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2023-03-23 |title=What is sportswashing and why is it such a big problem? |url=https://www.greenpeace.org.uk/news/sportswashing-definition-examples/ |access-date=2023-06-07 |website=Greenpeace UK |language=en |archive-date=27 March 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230327151216/https://www.greenpeace.org.uk/news/sportswashing-definition-examples/ |url-status=live }}</ref>
