{{short description|Overview of tectonics on icy moons}}
{{Orphan|date=April 2021}}
This article is intended to provide an overview of various aspects of the [[tectonics]] on [[icy moon]]s.

== General information ==
Igneous activity on icy moons can be defined as the melting, ascension, and solidification of liquids, particularly water and its ice polymorphs.<ref name=":9">{{Cite journal|date=1990-01-01|title=The tectonics of icy satellites|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0273117790901015|journal=Advances in Space Research|language=en|volume=10|issue=1|pages=173–182|doi=10.1016/0273-1177(90)90101-5|issn=0273-1177|last1=Murchie|first1=Scott L.|bibcode=1990AdSpR..10a.173M}}</ref> Tectonic features on icy lithospheres occur by global and regional stresses acting on the moon's interior.<ref name=":9" /> Fractures in the icy lithosphere influence the mechanisms by which the lithosphere reacts to stress.<ref name=":9" /> An unfractured ice lithosphere has a greater shear strength than tensile strength, and accordingly, compressional deformation must occur by shear failure and cause thrust and strike-slip faulting.<ref name=":9" /> Conversely, prefractured ice has much less shear strength, and extensional stress will produce normal faults and graben.<ref name=":9" />

Residual heat from accretion is one possible source of internal heat for icy moons. But only moons with radii greater than about 2000&nbsp;km are thought to be massive enough to melt pure water-ice in the outer layers.<ref name=":9" /> Tidal heating and the decay of radioactive elements are another possible source of internal heat on icy moons.<ref name=":9" /> Warming of a cold interior would cause the satellite to expand and undergo tensional stress on the surface.<ref name=":9" /> Cooling, on the other hand, would cause contraction and compression.<ref name=":9" /> Mantle convection likely occurred within most icy moons, but is not an important source of lithospheric stress.<ref name=":9" />

Asteroid and comet impacts are another source of thermal and seismic energy on icy moons.<ref name=":9" /> Impacts could produce melt pools, reactivation of older faults and/or cracks, and deformation to the region antipodal to the impact site.<ref name=":9" /> Impacts may impart three general fracture patterns on the icy moon: (1) a global system of radially symmetric fractures originating from the impact site, (2) concentric and radial fractures, and (3) collapse of an impact basin with radial and concentric troughs.<ref name=":9" />

Most icy satellites rotate synchronously.<ref name=":9" /> If the satellite rotated more rapidly during formation, rotation becomes synchronous within 1,000-1,000,000 years due to tidal friction.<ref name=":9" /> A decrease in rotational speed decreases the oblateness of the icy moon, which reduces principle stress in the north–south direction, thereby creating east–west trending dikes.<ref name=":9" /> If tidal friction causes the lithosphere to fail, east west extensional features should be expected near the poles, northeast/northwest strike slip features at mid-latitudes, and north–south compressional features at the equator.<ref name=":9" /> The transfer of angular momentum from the planet to the orbiting moon causes the moon's orbital distance to increase with time.<ref name=":9" /> As a consequence of increasing orbital distance, the tidal bulge decreases.<ref name=":9" /> These stresses should produce compression at the planet facing and antipode positions, extension at the poles, and strike-slip faults oriented northeast/northwest elsewhere.<ref name=":9" />

The mechanisms of plate tectonics on icy moons, particularly Earth-like plate tectonics are not widely agreed upon or well understood.<ref name=":10">{{Cite journal|date=2019-04-01|title=Can Earth-like plate tectonics occur in ocean world ice shells?|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S001910351830407X|journal=Icarus|language=en|volume=322|pages=69–79|doi=10.1016/j.icarus.2019.01.011|issn=0019-1035|last1=Howell|first1=Samuel M.|last2=Pappalardo|first2=Robert T.|bibcode=2019Icar..322...69H|s2cid=127545679 }}</ref> Plate tectonics on Earth is hypothesized to be driven by “slab pull,” where the sinking of the more dense subducting plate provides the spreading force for mid-ocean ridges.<ref name=":10" /> “Ridge push” is comparatively weak in Earth's plate tectonics.<ref name=":10" /> Extensional features are abundant on icy moons, but compressional features are sparse.<ref name=":10" /> Furthermore, subducting less dense ice into a more dense fluid is difficult to explain.<ref name=":9" /> Force balance modeling suggests that subduction is likely to create large scale topographic forcing across icy moons, because the buoyant force is orders of magnitude greater than subducting forces.<ref name=":10" /> Fracturing and plate-like motion is more easily explained by volume changes and ice-shell motion that is decoupled from interior motion.<ref name=":10" />

== Tectonic and volcanic features ==

=== Trough and Scarp Sets ===
Linear troughs, chains of pits, and scarps in coherent orientations have been observed on Mimas, Tethys, Rhea, Iapetus, Umbriel, Europa, and Ganymede. These features are thought to be formed from impacts or tidal forcing.<ref name=":9" /> 
[[File:Ganymede1.jpg|thumb|Ridges, grooves, craters and relatively smooth areas in the Uruk Sulcus region of Jupiter's moon Ganymede.]]

=== Scarps and troughs traversing older material ===
These features are similar in appearance to trough and scarp sets, but appear geologically distinct from the terrain in which they traverse. It is thought that the troughs are younger material. These features are considered normal faults and rifts formed by extensional tectonics.<ref name=":9" /> However, on Dione and Tethys, large impacts may have produced traversing scarps and troughs.<ref name=":9" />

=== Linear and curvilinear ridges ===
Ridges are uncommon, but have been observed on Rhea, Dione, and Ganymede. Ridges are thought to form by compression or transpression.<ref name=":9" />

=== Concentric and radial scarps and furrows ===
Collapsed impact basins are thought to form concentric and radial scarps. The Valhalla ring system on Callisto is one of the most well-preserved examples of these features. Concentric furrows on Ganymede's dark terrain appear, but only as troughs and without scarps.<ref name=":9" />

=== Volcanism ===
Four processes may produce volcanic activity on icy moons: (1) mantle convection, (2) negative diapirism, (3) impact cratering, and (4) antipodal fracturing in response to a large impact.<ref name=":9" /> The strongest evidence for volcanism is found in the polygonal coronae on Miranda, a large, fractured and resurfaced region embedded within a heavily cratered region.

=== Grooved terrain ===
Grooved terrain refers to features that are parallel or subparallel, dissect older terrain, are often associated with lighter colored terrain, and are negative relief structures rather than raised.<ref name=":9" /> The negative topography suggests that these features formed from global expansion of the icy moon, although some suggest the features formed by reactivation of older structures.<ref name=":9" />

North is to the top of the mosaic and the Sun illuminates the surface from the left. The smallest details that can be discerned in this picture are knobs and small impact craters about {{convert|155|m|yd|abbr=off|sp=us}} across. The resolution is {{convert|46|m|yd|abbr=off|sp=us}} per picture element, and the mosaic covers an area approximately {{convert|33|km|mi|abbr=off|sp=us}} across. A prominent fault scarp crosses the mosaic. This scarp is one of many structural features that form the Valhalla multi-ring structure.]]

== Observations ==

=== Europa ===
[[File:Europa's_surface.jpg|thumb|Europa]]
Voyager 2 and Galileo mission imagery revealed a highly fractured surface on Europa devoid of cratering, suggesting that the surface is regularly young and subject to resurfacing.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last=Kattenhorn|first=Simon A.|date=2018|title=Commentary: The Feasibility of Subduction and Implications for Plate Tectonics on Jupiter's Moon Europa|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research: Planets|language=en|volume=123|issue=3|pages=684–689|doi=10.1002/2018JE005524|bibcode=2018JGRE..123..684K|issn=2169-9100|doi-access=free}}</ref> Dilational bands appear morphologically similar to spreading ridges on Earth, and therefore suggest that warm ice ascends upwards to form the bands. However, compressional deformation features are sparse and too small to accommodate spreading from the dilational bands.<ref name=":0" /> A subduction mechanism is a key to the ice tectonics hypothesis on Europa. For subduction to occur, convection within or below the ice crust must exert stresses that exceed the strength of the overlying ice crust.<ref name=":0" /> But to hold a tenable tectonics hypothesis, one must explain how ice sinks below the surface.<ref name=":0" /> If the crustal ice porosity exceeds ~1%, subduction is unlikely, but the high concentrations of salt within the ice make subduction possible with porisities up to 10%.<ref name=":0" /> Subduction may occur if differences in salt content exceed 5% between the overriding plate and the subducting plate.<ref name=":0" /> However, the processes and conditions that initiate subduction are still poorly explained.

Europa's ice crust may be fractured by tidal stresses from Jupiter, and it has been hypothesized that liquid water could reach the surface through these cracks.<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal|last1=Gaidos|first1=Eric J.|last2=Nimmo|first2=Francis|date=June 2000|title=Tectonics and water on Europa|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=405|issue=6787|pages=637|doi=10.1038/35015170|pmid=10864313|s2cid=4384501|issn=1476-4687|doi-access=free}}</ref> However, the ice overburden pressure within the crust exceeds tidal stresses at depths greater than 35 m below the ice surface, thereby limiting the depth at which tidally-induced cracks can propagate.<ref name=":1" /> Furthermore, liquid water within any cracks will rapidly freeze. Therefore, a source other than tidal forcing must place the crust under tension for cracks to propagate deeply. Tides may force strike-slip motion along cracks, and this lateral motion would produce heat within the crack and make the ice more susceptible to ductile flow.<ref name=":1" /> The warmer and less viscous ice along the cracks is less dense than the surrounding ice, and may flow upwards to the surface.<ref name=":1" /> Melt generated within these fractures may briefly exist near the surface before percolating downward to the subsurface ocean over thousand year timescales.<ref name=":1" />

Truncated surface features suggest that subduction on Europa may occur along tabular zones.<ref name=":2">{{Cite journal|last1=Kattenhorn|first1=Simon A.|last2=Prockter|first2=Louise M.|date=October 2014|title=Evidence for subduction in the ice shell of Europa|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/ngeo2245|journal=Nature Geoscience|language=en|volume=7|issue=10|pages=762–767|doi=10.1038/ngeo2245|bibcode=2014NatGe...7..762K|issn=1752-0908}}</ref> Unlike subduction on Earth, differences in the strengths and relative densities of Europan ice, it is unlikely that the subducting ice plate is “pulled” into the subsurface ocean.<ref name=":2" /> Instead, it is most likely incorporated into the ice composing the overriding plate.<ref name=":2" /> Surface features that intersect tabular zones do not continue on the other side, unlike across strike-slip and dilational faults.<ref name=":2" />

Strike-slip faults in the northern hemisphere of Europa are predominantly left-lateral, while those in the southern hemisphere are predominantly right-lateral.<ref name=":3">{{Cite journal|date=2012-03-01|title=Shell tectonics: A mechanical model for strike-slip displacement on Europa|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S001910351100488X|journal=Icarus|language=en|volume=218|issue=1|pages=297–307|doi=10.1016/j.icarus.2011.12.015|issn=0019-1035|last1=Rhoden|first1=Alyssa Rose|last2=Wurman|first2=Gilead|last3=Huff|first3=Eric M.|last4=Manga|first4=Michael|last5=Hurford|first5=Terry A.|bibcode=2012Icar..218..297R|hdl=2060/20140005704|s2cid=39661090 |hdl-access=free}}</ref> This dichotomy becomes more pronounced the further the fault is from the equator.<ref name=":3" /> To explain this, the shell tectonics hypothesis describes a mechanism for strike-slip motion along faults driven by tidal forces from Jupiter.<ref name=":3" /> Numerical simulations of shell tectonics strike-slip faulting agrees closely with observations.<ref name=":3" /> However, the shell tectonics model requires that a substantial number of fractures or faults already exist on the surface.<ref name=":3" />

Convection and advection within the liquid ocean can transport and freeze liquid water into the ice crust, and that ocean-origin material may potentially reach the surface.<ref name=":4">{{Cite journal|last1=Green|first1=Austin|last2=Montesi|first2=Laurent|last3=Cooper|first3=Catherine|title=The Growth of Europa's Icy Shell: Convection and Crystallization|date=2020|series=Geological Society of America Abstracts with Programs|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/abs/2020am-359200|publisher=Geological Society of America|doi=10.1130/abs/2020am-359200|s2cid=242196353 }}</ref> However, the forces that drive extension in the ice crust are not well known. Slab pull, where a subducting ice plate pulls the crust apart at divergent boundaries is unlikely to drive extension because ice is less dense than liquid water, and therefore unable to sink into the subsurface ocean.<ref name=":4" />

=== Ganymede ===
Ganymede has two principle geologic units termed “dark” terrain and “bright” terrain. Bright terrain is hypothesized to be younger because it has fewer craters than the dark terrain.<ref name=":5">{{Cite journal|last1=Parmentier|first1=E. M.|last2=Squyres|first2=S.

(1982) suggests that the light terrain material flooded into the dark terrain, leaving dark topographic highs as the observed dark patches surrounded by lower elevation light terrain.<ref name=":5" /> Parmentier et al. (1982) find that mid-ocean ridge-like spreading does not occur on Ganymede, citing observations of poorly matched crater remnants and poorly fitting polygonal terrain in regions split by rifts.<ref name=":5" /> Instead, offset features and evidence of flooding suggest finite lithospheric rifting produces the bright terrain.<ref name=":5" /> Parmentier et al. (1982) infer that the dark terrain is an ice-silicate mixture that is slightly more dense than pure water ice. Extension in the dark terrain causes less dense water-ice to extrude upwards, forming linear and curve rifts of bright terrain.<ref name=":5" /> Long, narrow grooves appear in both bright and dark terrains, but are more abundant in light terrain.<ref name=":5" /> Grooves are typically symmetrical, which suggests that they are extensional features, rather than compressional features like folds or thrust faults.<ref name=":5" />

Head et al. (2002) reexamine possible formation mechanisms of bright and dark terrains on Ganymede using higher resolution Galileo mission imagery, with particular interest in whether the smooth areas described in Parmentier et al. (1982) are produced by cryovolcanic infilling.<ref name=":6">{{Cite journal|last1=Head|first1=James|last2=Pappalardo|first2=Robert|last3=Collins|first3=Geoffrey|last4=Belton|first4=Michael J.

Linear grooves and furrows thousands of kilometers in length form concentric arcs on Ganymede's surface.<ref name=":7">{{Cite journal|date=2018-12-06|title=Evidence of transpressional tectonics on the Uruk Sulcus region, Ganymede|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0040195118303548|journal=Tectonophysics|language=en|volume=749|pages=72–87|doi=10.1016/j.tecto.2018.10.026|issn=0040-1951|last1=Rossi|first1=Costanza|last2=Cianfarra|first2=Paola|last3=Salvini|first3=Francesco|last4=Mitri|first4=Giuseppe|last5=Massé|first5=Marion|bibcode=2018Tectp.749...72R|s2cid=135042744 }}</ref> Rossi et al.
