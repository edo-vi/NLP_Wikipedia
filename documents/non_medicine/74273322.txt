'''Alen Hadzic''' (Alen Hadžić; born November 15, 1991) is an American former [[épée]] fencer.<ref name="auto">{{Cite web|url=https://www.dailyrecord.com/story/sports/olympics/2021/07/14/olympics-complete-list-olympians-new-jersey-ties-tokyo-2021/7920404002/|title=Ready for the Olympics? Here's a complete list of Olympians with New Jersey ties|website=Morristown Daily Record|date=August 5, 2021|author=Jane Havsy}}</ref> In 2022-23, he was ranked 273rd in the world in men's epee. He had attended [[Montclair High School (New Jersey)|Montclair High School]] and [[Columbia University]], competing for the fencing teams at both schools. A [[Title IX]] complaint of [[sexual abuse]] was lodged against him with the university, and after an investigation Hadzic was suspended by Columbia University for one year, and barred from the fencing team. Though he was banned from representing Columbia University, he wasn’t banned from fencing at large, and Hadzic went on to coach boys and girls on the [[Tappan Zee High School]] fencing team. In 2013 the lawyer for the woman who was the victim in Hadzic's Title IX case urged [[USA Fencing]] to bar Hadzic from competitions, referring to him as a "known rapist" and noting his suspension, but USA Fencing CEO Kris Ekeren asserted that Hadzic hadn’t violated any of USA Fencing's policies.

In June 2021, after three women accused Hadzic of committing [[sexual misconduct]] against them, and at least 10 witnesses supported the claimants' allegations, the [[U.S. Center for SafeSport]] temporarily suspended him from any fencing activities. But later that month an arbitrator lifted the temporary suspension until his investigation was complete.  She opined that if Hadzic were to participate on the Olympic team, in her view it would not be “detrimental to the reputation of the United States or his sport.”

In the summer of 2021 he traveled to the [[2020 Summer Olympics|Tokyo Olympics]] as an alternate on the men's épée team; he never did compete at the Olympics, however, and Hadzic was therefore not an Olympian. USA Fencing imposed a "safety plan" to keep him away from other athletes, including requiring Hadzic to stay at a remote hotel that was outside the [[Olympic Village]] where his teammates were housed. All 23 of his Team USA fencing teammates signed a statement calling for him to be banned from their accommodations for their safety. Hadzic appealed USA Fencing's safety plan, but lost.

By July 2022, at least six women had filed claims of sexual misconduct, including rape, against Hadzic with SafeSport. In June 2023, after an investigation of over two years, due to his sexual misconduct Hadzic was permanently banned by SafeSport from participating in any activity of or under the [[United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee]].

In 2022/2023, he was ranked 273rd in the world in men's epee.<ref name="auto8"/>
