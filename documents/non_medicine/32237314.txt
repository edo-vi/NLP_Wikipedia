{{Short description|Moral behaviours of man-made machines}}
'''Machine ethics''' (or '''machine morality''', '''computational morality''', or '''computational ethics''') is a part of the [[ethics of artificial intelligence]] concerned with adding or ensuring moral behaviors of [[design|man-made]] machines that use artificial intelligence, otherwise known as [[Intelligent agent|artificial intelligent agents]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Moor |first1=J.H. |title=The Nature, Importance, and Difficulty of Machine Ethics |journal=IEEE Intelligent Systems |volume=21 |issue=4 |pages=18–21 |doi=10.1109/MIS.2006.80 |year=2006 |s2cid=831873 }}</ref> Machine ethics differs from other ethical fields related to [[engineering]] and [[technology]].  Machine ethics should not be confused with [[computer ethics]], which focuses on human use of computers. It should also be distinguished from the [[philosophy of technology]], which concerns itself with the grander social effects of technology.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Boyles |first1=Robert James |title=A Case for Machine Ethics in Modeling Human-Level Intelligent Agents |url=https://www.kritike.org/journal/issue_22/boyles_june2018.pdf |website=Kritike |access-date=1 November 2019}}</ref>

==History==
Before the 21st century the ethics of machines had largely been the subject of science fiction literature, mainly due to computing and [[artificial intelligence]] (AI) limitations. Although the definition of "Machine Ethics" has evolved since, the term was coined by Mitchell Waldrop in the 1987 AI Magazine article "A Question of Responsibility":<blockquote>''"However, one thing that is apparent from the above discussion is that intelligent machines will embody values, assumptions, and purposes, whether their programmers consciously intend them to or not. Thus, as computers and robots become more and more intelligent, it becomes imperative that we think carefully and explicitly about what those built-in values are. Perhaps what we need is, in fact, a theory and practice of machine ethics, in the spirit of Asimov’s [[Three Laws of Robotics|three laws of robotics]]."''<ref name="Waldrop1987">{{cite journal |last1=Waldrop |first1=Mitchell |title=A Question of Responsibility |journal=AI Magazine |date=Spring 1987 |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=28–39 |doi=10.1609/aimag.v8i1.572}}</ref></blockquote>

In 2004, ''Towards Machine Ethics'' <ref>Anderson, M., Anderson, S., and Armen, C. (2004) “Towards Machine Ethics” in Proceedings of the AAAI Workshop on Agent Organization: Theory and Practice, AAAI Press [https://aaai.org/Papers/Workshops/2004/WS-04-02/WS04-02-008.pdf]</ref> was presented at the AAAI Workshop on Agent Organizations: Theory and Practice <ref>[https://aaai.org/Library/Workshops/ws04-02.php AAAI Workshop on Agent Organization: Theory and Practice, AAAI Press]</ref> in which theoretical foundations for machine ethics were laid out.

It was in the AAAI Fall 2005 Symposium on Machine Ethics where researchers met for the first time to consider implementation of an ethical dimension in autonomous systems.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aaai.org/Library/Symposia/Fall/fs05-06 |title=Papers from the 2005 AAAI Fall Symposium |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129044821/http://www.aaai.org/Library/Symposia/Fall/fs05-06 |archive-date=2014-11-29 }}</ref>  A variety of perspectives of this nascent field can be found in the collected edition "Machine Ethics"<ref name="Anderson2011">{{Cite book |editor1-first= Michael |editor1-last= Anderson | editor2-first= Susan Leigh |editor2-last= Anderson  |date=July 2011 | title = Machine Ethics | isbn = 978-0-521-11235-2 | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]] }}</ref> that stems from the AAAI Fall 2005 Symposium on Machine Ethics.

In 2007, AI Magazine featured ''Machine Ethics: Creating an Ethical Intelligent Agent'',<ref name="anderson">Anderson, M. and Anderson, S. (2007). [http://ieet.org/archive/AIMagFinal.pdf Creating an Ethical Intelligent Agent]. ''AI Magazine'', Volume 28(4).</ref> an article that
discussed the importance of machine ethics, the need for machines that represent ethical principles explicitly, and the challenges facing those working on machine ethics. It also demonstrated that it is possible, at least in a limited domain, for a machine to abstract an ethical principle from examples of ethical judgments and use that principle to guide its own behavior.

In 2009, [[Oxford University Press]] published ''Moral Machines, Teaching Robots Right from Wrong'',<ref name="Wallach&Allen2009">{{cite book |last1=Wallach |first1=Wendell |last2=Allen |first2=Colin |title=Moral machines : teaching robots right from wrong |url=https://archive.org/details/moralmachinestea0000wall |url-access=registration |date=2009 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780195374049}}</ref> which it advertised as "the first book to examine the challenge of building artificial moral agents, probing deeply into the nature of human decision making and ethics." It cited some 450 sources, about 100 of which addressed [[#Focuses of machine ethics|major questions]] of machine ethics.

==Definitions==
[[James H. Moor]], one of the pioneering theoreticians in the field of [[computer ethics]], defines four kinds of ethical robots. As an extensive researcher on the studies of [[philosophy of artificial intelligence]], [[philosophy of mind]], [[philosophy of science]], and [[logic]], Moor defines machines to be ethical impact agents, implicit ethical agents, explicit ethical agents, or full ethical agents. A machine can be more than one type of agent.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Moor |first1=James M. |title=Four Kinds of Ethical Robots |url=https://philosophynow.org/issues/72/Four_Kinds_of_Ethical_Robots |website=Philosophy Now |date=2009}}</ref>
*'''Ethical impact agents''': These are machine systems that carry an ethical impact whether intended or not. At the same time, these agents have the potential to act unethical. Moor gives a hypothetical example called the 'Goodman agent', named after philosopher [[Nelson Goodman]]. The Goodman agent compares dates but has the [[Year 2000 problem|millennium bug]]. This bug resulted from programmers who represented dates with only the last two digits of the year. So any dates beyond 2000 would be misleadingly treated as earlier than those in the late twentieth century. Thus the Goodman agent was an ethical impact agent before 2000, and an unethical impact agent thereafter.
*'''Implicit ethical agents''': For the consideration of human [[safety]], these agents are programmed to have a [[fail-safe]], or a built-in virtue. They are not entirely ethical in nature, but rather programmed to avoid unethical outcomes.
*'''Explicit ethical agents''': These are machines that are capable of processing scenarios and acting on ethical decisions. Machines which have algorithms to act ethically.
*'''Full ethical agents''': These machines are similar to explicit ethical agents in being able to make ethical decisions. However, they also contain human [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] features. (i.e. have [[free will]], [[consciousness]] and [[intentionality]])
(See [[Moral responsibility#Artificial systems|artificial systems and moral responsibility]].)

==Focuses of machine ethics==

=== AI control problem ===
{{Main|Existential risk from artificial general intelligence|AI control problem}}

Some scholars, such as philosopher [[Nick Bostrom]] and AI researcher [[Stuart J. Russell|Stuart Russell]], argue that if AI surpasses humanity in general intelligence and becomes "[[superintelligence|superintelligent]]", then this new superintelligence could become powerful and difficult to control: just as the fate of the [[mountain gorilla]] depends on human goodwill, so might the fate of humanity depend on the actions of a future machine superintelligence.<ref name="superintelligence">{{cite book|last1=Bostrom|first1=Nick|author-link=Nick Bostrom|title=Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies|date=2014|isbn=978-0199678112|edition=First|title-link=Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies}}</ref>  In their respective books ''[[Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies|Superintelligence]]'' and ''[[Human Compatible: Artificial Intelligence and the Problem of Control|Human Compatible]]'', both scholars assert that while there is much uncertainty regarding the future of AI, the risk to humanity is great enough to merit significant action in the present.

This presents the [[AI control problem]]: how to build an intelligent agent that will aid its creators, while avoiding inadvertently building a superintelligence that will harm its creators. The danger of not [[design]]ing control right "the first time," is that a superintelligence may be able to seize power over its environment and prevent humans from shutting it down. Potential AI control strategies include "capability control" (limiting an AI's ability to influence the world) and "motivational control" (one way of building an AI whose goals are [[AI alignment|aligned]] with human or optimal [[Value (ethics)|values]]).  There are a number of organizations researching the AI control problem, including the [[Future of Humanity Institute]], the [[Machine Intelligence Research Institute]], the [[Center for Human-Compatible Artificial Intelligence]], and the [[Future of Life Institute]].

===Algorithms and training===

AI paradigms have been debated over, especially in relation to their efficacy and bias. [[Nick Bostrom]] and [[Eliezer Yudkowsky]] have argued for [[decision trees]] (such as [[ID3 algorithm|ID3]]) over [[Artificial neural network|neural networks]] and [[genetic algorithm]]s on the grounds that decision trees obey modern social norms of transparency and predictability (e.g. ''[[stare decisis]]'').<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.nickbostrom.com/ethics/artificial-intelligence.pdf | title= The Ethics of Artificial Intelligence | first1= Nick | last1= Bostrom | author-link1= Nick Bostrom | first2= Eliezer | last2= Yudkowsky | author-link2= Eliezer Yudkowsky | year= 2011 | work= Cambridge Handbook of Artificial Intelligence | publisher= [[Cambridge Press]] | access-date= 2011-06-28 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160304015020/http://www.nickbostrom.com/ethics/artificial-intelligence.pdf | archive-date= 2016-03-04 | url-status= dead }}</ref> In contrast, Chris Santos-Lang argued in favor of neural networks and genetic algorithms on the grounds that the norms of any age must be allowed to change and that natural failure to fully satisfy these particular norms has been essential in making humans less vulnerable than machines to criminal "[[Hacker (programmer subculture)|hackers]]".<ref name="SantosLang2002">{{cite web | url= http://knol.google.com/k/chris-santos-lang/ethics-for-artificial-intelligences/3iue30fi4gfq9/1 | title= Ethics for Artificial Intelligences | first= Chris | last= Santos-Lang | year= 2002 | url-status= dead | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20111203030304/http://knol.google.com/k/chris-santos-lang/ethics-for-artificial-intelligences/3iue30fi4gfq9/1 | archive-date= 2011-12-03 }}</ref><ref name="SantosLang2014">{{cite book |last=Santos-Lang |first=Christopher | year=2014 |editor1-first=Simon |editor1-last=van Rysewyk  |editor2-first=Matthijs |editor2-last=Pontier |title=Machine Medical Ethics |volume=74 |publisher=Springer | location=Switzerland | pages=111–127 | chapter=Moral Ecology Approaches to Machine Ethics| chapter-url=http://grinfree.com/MoralEcology.pdf | doi=10.1007/978-3-319-08108-3_8|series=Intelligent Systems, Control and Automation: Science and Engineering |isbn=978-3-319-08107-6 }}</ref>

In 2009, in an experiment at the Laboratory of Intelligent Systems in the [[École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne|Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale]] of [[Lausanne]] in [[Switzerland]], AI robots were programmed to cooperate with each other and tasked with the goal of searching for a beneficial resource while avoiding a poisonous resource.<ref name="PopSci_2009-08-18">{{Cite news |url=http://www.popsci.com/scitech/article/2009-08/evolving-robots-learn-lie-hide-resources-each-other |title=Evolving Robots Learn To Lie To Each Other |work=Popular Science |date=August 18, 2009 |first=Stuart |last=Fox}}</ref> During the experiment, the robots were grouped into clans, and the successful members' digital genetic code was used for the next generation, a type of algorithm known as a [[genetic algorithm]]. After 50 successive generations in the AI, one clan's members discovered how to distinguish the beneficial resource from the poisonous one. The robots then learned to lie to each other in an attempt to hoard the beneficial resource from other robots.<ref name="PopSci_2009-08-18"/>  In the same experiment, the same AI robots also learned to behave selflessly and signaled danger to other robots, and also died at the cost to save other robots.<ref name="SantosLang2002"/> The implications of this experiment have been challenged by machine ethicists. In the Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale experiment, the robots' goals were programmed to be "terminal". In contrast, human motives typically have a quality of requiring never-ending learning.

=== Autonomous weapons systems ===
{{main|Lethal autonomous weapon}}
{{see also|Slaughterbots}}

In 2009, academics and technical experts attended a conference to discuss the potential impact of robots and computers and the impact of the hypothetical possibility that they could become self-sufficient and able to make their own decisions. They discussed the possibility and the extent to which computers and robots might be able to acquire any level of autonomy, and to what degree they could use such abilities to possibly pose any threat or hazard. They noted that some machines have acquired various forms of semi-autonomy, including being able to find power sources on their own and being able to independently choose targets to attack with weapons. They also noted that some computer viruses can evade elimination and have achieved "cockroach intelligence." They noted that self-awareness as depicted in science-fiction is probably unlikely, but that there were other potential hazards and pitfalls.<ref name="nytimes july09">{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/26/science/26robot.html |title=Scientists Worry Machines May Outsmart Man |first=John |last=Markoff |work=New York Times |date=July 25, 2009}}</ref>

Some experts and academics have questioned the use of robots for military combat, especially when such robots are given some degree of autonomous functions.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/8182003.stm |title=Call for debate on killer robots |first=Jason |last=Palmer |work=BBC News |date=3 August 2009}}</ref> The US Navy has funded a report which indicates that as military robots become more complex, there should be greater attention to implications of their ability to make autonomous decisions.<ref>[http://www.dailytech.com/New%20Navyfunded%20Report%20Warns%20of%20War%20Robots%20Going%20Terminator/article14298.htm Science New Navy-funded Report Warns of War Robots Going "Terminator"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090728101106/http://www.dailytech.com/New%20Navyfunded%20Report%20Warns%20of%20War%20Robots%20Going%20Terminator/article14298.htm |date=2009-07-28 }}, by Jason Mick (Blog), dailytech.com, February 17, 2009.</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.engadget.com/2009/02/18/navy-report-warns-of-robot-uprising-suggests-a-strong-moral-com/ |title=Navy report warns of robot uprising, suggests a strong moral compass |first=Joseph L. |last=Flatley  |work=Engadget |date=February 18, 2009}}</ref> The President of the [[Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence]] has commissioned a study to look at this issue.<ref>[http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/horvitz/AAAI_Presidential_Panel_2008-2009.htm AAAI Presidential Panel on Long-Term AI Futures 2008–2009 Study], Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence, Accessed 7/26/09.</ref> They point to programs like the Language Acquisition Device which can emulate human interaction.

=== Integration of Artificial General Intelligences with society ===
Preliminary work has been conducted on methods of integrating [[artificial general intelligence]]s (full ethical agents as defined above) with existing legal and social frameworks. Approaches have focused on consideration of their legal position and rights.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Sotala|first1=Kaj|last2=Yampolskiy|first2=Roman V|date=2014-12-19|title=Responses to catastrophic AGI risk: a survey|journal=Physica Scripta|volume=90|issue=1|pages=8|doi=10.1088/0031-8949/90/1/018001|issn=0031-8949|doi-access=free}}</ref>

=== Machine learning bias ===
{{further|Algorithmic bias}}
[[Big data]] and [[machine learning]] [[algorithm]]s have become popular among numerous industries including [[online advertising]], [[credit rating]]s, and criminal sentencing, with the promise of providing more objective, data-driven results, but have been identified as a potential source for perpetuating social inequalities and [[discrimination]].<ref name="NYT2016">{{cite news|last1=Crawford|first1=Kate |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/26/opinion/sunday/artificial-intelligences-white-guy-problem.html|title=Artificial Intelligence's White Guy Problem|date=25 June 2016|work=The New York Times}}</ref><ref name="ProPublica2016">{{cite news|author1=Julia Angwin |author1-link=Julia Angwin |author2=Surya Mattu |author3=Jeff Larson |author4=Lauren Kircher|url=https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing|title=Machine Bias: There's Software Used Across the Country to Predict Future Criminals. And it's Biased Against Blacks.|date=23 May 2016|work=ProPublica}}</ref>  A 2015 study found that women were less likely to be shown high-income job ads by [[Google]]'s [[AdSense]]. Another study found that [[Amazon.com|Amazon]]’s same-day delivery service was intentionally made unavailable in black neighborhoods. Both Google and Amazon were unable to isolate these outcomes to a single issue, but instead explained that the outcomes were the result of the [[black box]] algorithms they used.<ref name="NYT2016" />

The United States judicial system has begun using [[quantitative risk assessment software]] when making decisions related to releasing people on bail and sentencing in an effort to be more fair and to reduce an already high [[United States incarceration rate|imprisonment rate]]. These tools analyze a defendant's criminal history among other attributes. In a study of 7,000 people arrested in [[Broward County, Florida|Broward County]], [[Florida]], only 20% of the individuals predicted to commit a crime using the county's [[risk assessment]] scoring system proceeded to commit a crime.<ref name="ProPublica2016" />  A 2016 [[ProPublica]] report analyzed [[recidivism]] risk scores calculated by one of the most commonly used tools, the Northpointe [[COMPAS (software)|COMPAS]] system, and looked at outcomes over two years. The report found that only 61% of those deemed high risk wound up committing additional crimes during that period. The report also flagged that African-American defendants were far more likely to be given high-risk scores relative to their white defendant counterparts.<ref name="ProPublica2016" /> Legally, such pretrial risk assessments have been argued to violate [[Equal Protection]] rights on the basis of race, due to a number of factors including possible discriminatory intent from the algorithm itself under a theory of partial legal capacity for artificial intelligences.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Thomas|first1=C.|last2=Nunez|first2=A.|date=2022|title=Automating Judicial Discretion: How Algorithmic Risk Assessments in Pretrial Adjudications Violate Equal Protection Rights on the Basis of Race|journal=[[Law & Inequality]]|language=en|volume=40|issue=2|pages=371–407|url=https://scholarship.law.umn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1680&context=lawineq|doi=10.24926/25730037.649}}</ref>

In 2016, the [[Obama Administration]]'s Big Data Working Group—an overseer of various big-data regulatory frameworks—released reports arguing “the potential of encoding discrimination in automated decisions” and calling for “equal opportunity by design” for applications such as credit scoring.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/2016_0504_data_discrimination.pdf|title=Big Data: A Report on Algorithmic Systems, Opportunity, and Civil Rights|last1=Executive Office of the President|date=May 2016|publisher=Obama White House}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2016/05/04/big-risks-big-opportunities-intersection-big-data-and-civil-rights|title=Big Risks, Big Opportunities: the Intersection of Big Data and Civil Rights|date=4 May 2016|publisher=Obama White House}}</ref> The reports encourage discourse among [[Policy-makers|policy makers]], citizens, and academics alike, but recognizes that it does not have a potential solution for the encoding of [[bias]] and discrimination into algorithmic systems.

==Ethical frameworks and practices==

===Practices===
In March 2018, in an effort to address rising concerns over machine learning's impact on [[human rights]], the [[World Economic Forum]] and [[Global Future Council on Human Rights]] published a [[white paper]] with detailed recommendations on how best to prevent discriminatory outcomes in machine learning.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.weforum.org/whitepapers/how-to-prevent-discriminatory-outcomes-in-machine-learning/|title=How to Prevent Discriminatory Outcomes in Machine Learning|website=World Economic Forum |date=12 March 2018 |access-date=2018-12-11}}</ref> The World Economic Forum developed four recommendations based on the ''UN Guiding Principles of Human Rights'' to help address and prevent discriminatory outcomes in machine learning.

The World Economic Forum's recommendations are as follows:<ref name=":0" />

# '''Active Inclusion:''' the development and design of machine learning applications must actively seek a diversity of input, especially of the norms and values of specific populations affected by the output of AI systems
# '''[[Fairness (machine learning)|Fairness]]:''' People involved in conceptualizing, developing, and implementing machine learning systems should consider which definition of fairness best applies to their context and application, and prioritize it in the architecture of the machine learning system and its evaluation metrics
# '''Right to Understanding:''' Involvement of machine learning systems in decision-making that affects individual rights must be disclosed, and the systems must be able to provide an explanation of their decision-making that is understandable to end users and reviewable by a competent human authority. Where this is impossible and rights are at stake, leaders in the design, deployment, and regulation of machine learning technology must question whether or not it should be used
# '''Access to Redress:''' Leaders, designers, and developers of machine learning systems are responsible for identifying the potential negative human rights impacts of their systems. They must make visible avenues for redress for those affected by disparate impacts, and establish processes for the timely redress of any discriminatory outputs.

In January 2020, Harvard University's [[Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society|Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society]] published a meta-study of 36 prominent sets of principles for AI, identifying eight key themes: privacy, accountability, safety and security, transparency and [[explainable artificial intelligence|explainability]], fairness and non-discrimination, human control of technology, professional responsibility, and promotion of human values.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Fjeld|first1=Jessica|last2=Achten|first2=Nele|last3=Hilligoss|first3=Hannah|last4=Nagy|first4=Adam|last5=Srikumar|first5=Madhulika|date=2020|title=Principled Artificial Intelligence: Mapping Consensus in Ethical and Rights-Based Approaches to Principles for AI|journal=SSRN Working Paper Series|doi=10.2139/ssrn.3518482|s2cid=214464355|issn=1556-5068|url=http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:42160420}}</ref> A similar meta-study was conducted by researchers from the [[ETH Zurich|Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich]] in 2019.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Jobin|first1=Anna|last2=Ienca|first2=Marcello|last3=Vayena|first3=Effy|author-link3=Effy Vayena|date=2019|title=The global landscape of AI ethics guidelines|journal=Nature Machine Intelligence|volume=1|issue=9|pages=389–399|doi=10.1038/s42256-019-0088-2| arxiv=1906.11668|s2cid=201827642|issn=2522-5839|doi-access=free}}</ref>

One thought experiment focuses on a ''Genie Golem'' with unlimited powers presenting itself to the reader. This Genie declares that it will return in 50 years and demands that it be provided with a definite set of morals that it will then immediately act upon. The purpose of this experiment is to initiate a discourse over how best to handle defining complete set of ethics that computers may understand.<ref>Nazaretyan, A. (2014). A. H. Eden, J. H. Moor, J.

==In fiction==
In [[science fiction]], movies and novels have played with the idea of sentience in robots and machines.

[[Neill Blomkamp|Neil Blomkamp's]] [[Chappie (film)|Chappie]] (2015) enacted a scenario of being able to transfer one's consciousness into a computer.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Brundage |first1=Miles |last2=Winterton |first2=Jamie |title=Chappie and the Future of Moral Machines |url=https://slate.com/technology/2015/03/chappie-robot-ethics-the-film-raises-interesting-questions-about-morality.html |website=Slate |date=17 March 2015 |access-date=30 October 2019}}</ref> The film, [[Ex Machina (film)|Ex Machina]] (2014) by [[Alex Garland]], followed an [[Android (robot)|android]] with artificial intelligence undergoing a variation of the [[Turing Test]], a test administered to a machine to see if its behavior can be distinguished from  that of a human. Works such as [[The Terminator]] (1984) and [[The Matrix]] (1999) incorporate the concept of machines turning on their human masters (See [[Artificial Intelligence#In fiction|Artificial Intelligence]]).

[[Isaac Asimov]] considered the issue in the 1950s in [[I, Robot]]. At the insistence of his editor [[John W. Campbell Jr.]], he proposed the [[Three Laws of Robotics]] to govern artificially intelligent systems. Much of his work was then spent testing the boundaries of his three laws to see where they would break down, or where they would create paradoxical or unanticipated behavior. His work suggests that no set of fixed laws can sufficiently anticipate all possible circumstances.<ref name=Asimov2008>{{Cite book

In his post-apocalyptic scenario, he questioned if empathy was an entirely human characteristic. His story is the basis for the science fiction film, ''[[Blade Runner]]'' (1982).
