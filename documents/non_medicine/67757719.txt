{{Vaccination}}
A '''vaccinator''' is a person who gives injections of a [[vaccine]] to people. Vaccinators require the skills of knowing where to inject the needle into the recipient as well as preparing the substance to be injected.<ref name="auto1">{{Cite web|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/who-giving-covid-vaccines-states-scramble-find-vaccinators-n1258370|title=Who is giving the Covid shots? States facing new shortage problem|website=NBC News}}</ref>

Under normal conditions, routine inoculations can be given by oneâ€™s healthcare provider, at a [[pharmacy]], or at special clinics set up in a community. But when a [[mass vaccination]] effort is being undertaken, such as during a [[pandemic]], people of various qualifying occupations may be sought specifically for the role as vaccinators due to high demand. Some of them may work full time at the job; others could do so part time in addition to their regular occupation. Some retirees may also work part-time.<ref name="auto1"/>
