'''Rescue fusion hybridization''' is a process used to manufacture some therapeutic [[cancer vaccine]]s in which individual tumor cells obtained through biopsy are fused with an antibody-secreting cell to form a [[heterohybridoma]]. This cell then secretes the unique idiotype, or [[immunoglobulin]] antigen characteristic of the individual tumor, which is purified for use as the vaccine.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.genengnews.com/analysis-and-insight/what-comes-after-dendreon-s-provenge/77899342/ |title=What Comes After Dendreon's Provenge? |date=18 Oct 2010 }}</ref> It is used to produce the [[BiovaxID]] vaccine for [[follicular lymphoma]].{{citation needed|date=March 2022}}
