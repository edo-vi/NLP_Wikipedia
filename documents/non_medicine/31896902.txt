'''Verb displacement''' as it relates to prose, is a technique used to impart a lyrical or poetic feel to a phrase, sentence, or paragraph.<ref>"[[The Well-Spoken Thesaurus]]", Tom Heehler, [[Sourcebooks]] 2011</ref> This technique finds particular expression in [[minimalist]] literature. 

Specifically, verb displacement involves only those verbs that can be displaced by the word "is" or its past tense "was." For instance, in this excerpt from the novel ''[[For Whom the Bell Tolls]]'', instead of writing "He died in April," [[Ernest Hemingway]] displaces the verb "died" with "is," and thereby creates a more lyrical effect:

{{quotation|"Kashkin," Robert Jordan said. "That would be Kashkin."{{br}}
{{br}}
"Yes," said Pablo. "It was a very rare name. Something like that. What became of him?"{{br}}
{{br}}
''"He is dead since April."''|''[[For Whom the Bell Tolls]]'', [[Ernest Hemingway]]}}

== Origins ==
The term as it relates to prose in literature (as opposed to poetry or linguistics<ref>"New Horizons in the Study of Language", Noam Chomsky</ref><ref>"Language and Mind", Noam Chomsky</ref>) was first introduced in 2011 by [[Tom Heehler]], author of ''[[The Well-Spoken Thesaurus]]'', to describe one of the ways in which minimalist writers are able—consciously or otherwise—to enhance simple language without increasing complexity.
