[[Concussion]]s, a type of mild [[traumatic brain injury]], are a frequent concern for those playing [[sport]]s, from children and teenagers to professional athletes. Repeated concussions are known to cause [[neurological disorder]]s, particularly [[chronic traumatic encephalopathy]] (CTE), which in professional athletes has led to premature retirement, erratic behavior and even [[suicide]]. A sports-related concussion is defined as a "complex pathophysiological process affecting the brain, induced by biomechanical forces".<ref>{{cite journal |last1=McCrory |first1=Paul |last2=Feddermann-Demont |first2=Nina |last3=Dvořák |first3=Jiří |last4=Cassidy |first4=J David |last5=McIntosh |first5=Andrew |last6=Vos |first6=Pieter E |last7=Echemendia |first7=Ruben J |last8=Meeuwisse |first8=Willem |last9=Tarnutzer |first9=Alexander A |title=What is the definition of sports-related concussion: a systematic review |journal=British Journal of Sports Medicine |date=June 2017 |volume=51 |issue=11 |pages=877–887 |doi=10.1136/bjsports-2016-097393 |pmid=29098981 |hdl=1959.17/164207 |hdl-access=free |s2cid=206882999 }}</ref> Because concussions cannot be seen on [[X-rays]] or [[CT scans]], attempts to prevent concussions have been difficult.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/concussion/basics/tests-diagnosis/con-20019272|title=Concussion Tests and diagnosis|website=Mayo Clinic}}</ref>

The danger of repeated concussions has long been known for [[boxing|boxers]] and [[wrestling|wrestlers]]. A form of CTE common in these two sports, [[dementia pugilistica]] (DP), was first described in 1928. An awareness of the risk of concussions in other sports began to grow in the 1990s, and especially in the mid-2000s, in both the medical and the professional sports communities, as a result of the study of brains of prematurely deceased [[American football]] players, that showed an extremely high incidence of CTE (see [[concussions in American football]]).

As of 2012, the [[Major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada|four major professional sports leagues]] in the United States and Canada included policies for managing concussion risk.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/topics/_/page/concussions |title=Concussions in sports – NFL Topics – ESPN |publisher=Espn.go.com |access-date=30 June 2012}}</ref> Sports-related concussions are generally analyzed by athletic training or medical staff on the sidelines using an evaluation tool for cognitive function known as the Sport Concussion Assessment Tool (SCAT), a symptom severity checklist, and a [[Balance (ability)|balance]] test.<ref name="Harmon, K.

== Dangers ==
Concussion symptoms can last for an undetermined amount of time depending on the player and the severity of the concussion. Concussion symptoms can be described as immediate and delayed.<ref name=":1">{{cite journal|last1=Livingston|first1=Scott C|year=2011|title=The Neurophysiology Behind Concussion Signs and Symptoms|journal=International Journal of Athletic Therapy & Training|volume=16|issue=5|pages=5–9|doi=10.1123/ijatt.16.5.5}}</ref> The immediate symptoms experienced after concussions include  memory loss, disorientation, and poor balance.<ref name=":1" /> Delayed symptoms experienced in the later stages include sleeping disorders and behavioral changes. Both immediate and delayed symptoms can continue for long periods of time and have a negative impact on recovery.<ref name=":1" />

=== Post-concussion syndrome ===
There is the potential of [[post-concussion syndrome]], defined as a set of symptoms that continue after a concussion is sustained.<ref name=":0" />  Post-concussion symptoms can be classified as physical, cognitive, emotional, and sleep symptoms.<ref name=":0" /> Physical symptoms include headache, nausea, and vomiting.<ref name=":0" />  Athletes may experience cognitive symptoms that include speaking slowly, difficulty remembering and concentrating.<ref name=":0" /> Emotional and sleep symptoms include irritability, sadness, drowsiness, and trouble falling asleep.<ref name=":0">{{cite journal |doi=10.1186/s12245-014-0031-6 |pmid=25635191 |title=Who gets post-concussion syndrome?

=== Second-impact syndrome ===
Ignoring concussions makes athletes more vulnerable to incurring further head trauma, stressing the importance of rigorous concussion testing protocols in [[professional sports]]. Subsequent impact can cause a rare condition known as [[second-impact syndrome]], which can result in severe injury or death.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=19561758 |pmc=2672291 |year=2009 |last1=Bey |first1=T |title=Second impact syndrome |journal=The Western Journal of Emergency Medicine |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=6–10 |last2=Ostick |first2=B }}</ref> Second-impact syndrome is a result of a second head injury before the brain has adequate time to heal between concussions.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/jlme.12126 |pmid=25040374 |title=Causes and Consequences of Sports Concussion |journal=The Journal of Law, Medicine & Ethics |volume=42 |issue=2 |pages=128–32 |year=2014 |last1=Edwards |first1=Jonathan C |last2=Bodle |first2=Jeffrey D |s2cid=35061638 }}</ref> It typically give signs and symptoms of a post-concussion syndrome (visual, motor, or sensory abnormalities and difficulties with cognitive processes).

=== Risk from repeated concussions ===
Repeated concussions have been linked to a variety of neurological disorders among athletes, including [[chronic traumatic encephalopathy]] (CTE), [[Alzheimer's disease]], [[Parkinsonism]] and [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]] (ALS).<ref name="cantuCTE">{{cite journal |last1=Cantu |first1=Robert C. |title=Chronic traumatic encephalopathy in the National Football League |journal=Neurosurgery |date=August 2007 |volume=61 |issue=2 |pages=223–225 |doi=10.1227/01.NEU.0000255514.73967.90 |pmid=17762733 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Pellman |first1=Elliot J. |last2=Viano |first2=David C. |last3=Withnall |first3=Chris |last4=Shewchenko |first4=Nick |last5=Bir |first5=Cynthia A. |last6=Halstead |first6=P.

Repeated concussions or mild-to-moderate [[Traumatic brain injury|traumatic brain injuries]] (TBI) have also been established to have effects on the motor dysfunction and movement disorders, however a systematic review has concluded that more investigation is needed to fully understand the long term effects of concussions and TBIs.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.3109/02699052.2016.1147080|pmid=27120772 |title=Movement disorders and motor impairments following repeated head trauma: A systematic review of the literature 1990–2015 |journal=Brain Injury |volume=30 |issue=8 |pages=937–947 |year=2016|last1=Ozolins|first1=Bede |last2=Aimers|first2=Nicole|last3=Parrington|first3=Lucy|last4=Pearce|first4=Alan J.|s2cid=11524717 }}</ref>

=== Other risks ===
In addition, returning to sports with impaired sensorimotor function after experiencing a sports-related concussion increases the risk of sustaining [[musculoskeletal]] (MSK) injuries.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=McPherson|first1=April L.|last2=Nagai|first2=Takashi|last3=Webster|first3=Kate E.|last4=Hewett|first4=Timothy E.|year=2019|title=Musculoskeletal Injury Risk After Sport-Related Concussion: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis|journal=The American Journal of Sports Medicine|volume=47|issue=7|pages=1754–1762|doi=10.1177/0363546518785901|pmid=30074832|s2cid=51911315}}</ref> In addition, athletes that experience a concussion are twice as likely to sustain a musculoskeletal injury compared to non-concussed athletes.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=McPherson |first1=April L. |last2=Nagai |first2=Takashi |last3=Webster |first3=Kate E. |last4=Hewett |first4=Timothy E. |title=Musculoskeletal Injury Risk After Sport-Related Concussion: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis |journal=The American Journal of Sports Medicine |date=June 2019 |volume=47 |issue=7 |pages=1754–1762 |doi=10.1177/0363546518785901 |pmid=30074832 |s2cid=51911315 }}</ref>

== Incidence ==
It is estimated that as many as 1.6–3.8 million concussions occur in the US per year in competitive sports and recreational activities; this is a rough estimate, since as many as 50% of concussions go unreported.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/bjsports-2012-091941 |pmid=23243113 |title=American Medical Society for Sports Medicine position statement: Concussion in sport |journal=British Journal of Sports Medicine |volume=47 |issue=1 |pages=15–26 |year=2013 |last1=Harmon |first1=Kimberly G |last2=Drezner |first2=Jonathan A |last3=Gammons |first3=Matthew |last4=Guskiewicz |first4=Kevin M |last5=Halstead |first5=Mark |last6=Herring |first6=Stanley A |last7=Kutcher |first7=Jeffrey S |last8=Pana |first8=Andrea |last9=Putukian |first9=Margot |last10=Roberts |first10=William O |doi-access=free }}</ref> Concussions occur in all sports with the highest incidence in American football, ice hockey, rugby, soccer, and basketball.<ref name="Harmon, K.

Women's ice hockey was reported as one of the most dangerous sports in the [[NCAA]], with a concussion rate of 2.72 per 1,000 player hours. Even though men's ice hockey allows body checking, while women's ice hockey does not, the rate of concussions for men is 46% lower, at 1.47 per 1,000 player hours. [[College football]] also has lower concussion rates than women's hockey, with a rate of 2.34 per 1,000.<ref>{{cite news|last=Klein |first=Jeff Z. |url=http://slapshot.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/10/19/at-the-mayo-clinic-womens-hockey-a-most-dangerous-game/ |title=Women's Hockey, a Most Dangerous Game – NYTimes.com |publisher=Slapshot.blogs.nytimes.com |date=19 October 2010 |access-date=4 July 2012}}</ref>

Women's basketball is one of the women's sports with the highest risks of getting a concussion. Women have a greater risk of getting a concussion by dribbling/ball handling rather than defending. Also it was found that female college basketball players typically receive concussions during games rather than practices.<ref>"The Epidemiology of Sport-Related Concussion."

If a player is cleared by the Unaffiliated Neurotrauma Consultant (UNC), then they are allowed to play but will be monitored closely throughout the game. If a player is diagnosed with a concussion, then that player is not allowed back in the game. A return to play process is issued, which includes five steps, "1. Rest and recovery 2. Light aerobic exercise 3. Continued aerobic exercise/strength training 4. Football specific activities 5.

Almost every team has experienced a player who will "keep playing, then manage to stumble off the field, unnoticed by the coaches, cameras or press. He might take a breather for a series or two. But he can walk, so he wants to play.

According to [[Johns Hopkins University]], a study took place which "researchers recruited nine former NFL players who retired decades ago and who ranged in age from 57 to 74.

=== Association football ===
[[Association football]]— also known as soccer— is a major source of sports-related concussions around the world. Even though 50–80% of injuries in football are directed to the legs, head injuries have been shown to account for between 4 and 22% of football injuries. There is the possibility that heading the ball could damage the head, as the ball can travel at 100&nbsp;km/hour; although most professional footballers have reported that they experienced head injuries from colliding with other players and the ground.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://faculty.washington.edu/chudler/soccer.html|title=Neuroscience for Kids – Soccer|publisher=Faculty.washington.edu|access-date=4 July 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://health.usnews.com/health-news/articles/2015/07/13/banning-soccer-headers-wont-solve-concussion-problem-study|title=Banning Soccer 'Headers' Won't Solve Concussion Problem: Study|last1=Mozes|first1=Alan|website=[[U.S. News & World Report]]|access-date=13 July 2015}}</ref>

There has been widespread debate on protective headgear in soccer. Known as a sport associated with intricate footwork, speed, and well-timed passes, soccer also is classified as a high- to moderate-intensity contact/collision sport, with rates of head injury and concussion similar to those seen in football, ice hockey, lacrosse, and rugby. While the benefits of helmets and other head protection are more obvious in the other sports, the role of headgear in soccer was unclear {{asof|2013|lc=y}}.<ref>Malonie, Jamie, Linda Nield, and Matthew Livley.

There are clear rules from FIFA regarding what to do when a player gets a concussion. FIFA's guidelines say that a player who has been knocked unconscious should not play again that day. The rules do however allow for "a transient alteration of conscious level" following a head injury, which says that a player can return to play following assessment by medical staff. The rules also state that a player who is injured with head damage is not to be played for five days.<ref name="Guardian" />

Olympic boxers deliver punches with high impact velocity but lower [[head injury criterion]] and translational acceleration than in football impacts because of a lower effective punch mass.

=== Rugby union ===
{{Main|Concussions in rugby union}}
Concussions are also a significant factor in [[rugby union]], another full-contact sport. In 2011, the sport's world governing body, [[World Rugby]] (then known as the International Rugby Board, or IRB), issued a highly detailed policy for dealing with injured players with suspected concussions. Under the policy, a player suffering from a suspected concussion is not allowed to return to play in that game. Players are not cleared to play after the injury for a minimum of 21 days, unless they are being supervised in their recovery by a medical practitioner. Even when medical advice is present, players must complete a multi-step monitoring process before being cleared to play again; this process requires a minimum of six days.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irbplayerwelfare.com/?documentid=3|title=IRB Concussion Guidelines|date=24 May 2011|publisher=International Rugby Board|access-date=16 February 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130414105714/http://www.irbplayerwelfare.com/?documentid=3|archive-date=14 April 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> In 2012, the IRB modified the policy, instituting a Pitchside Suspected Concussion Assessment (PSCA), under which players suspected of having suffered concussions are to leave the field for 5&nbsp;minutes while doctors assess their condition via a series of questions. Players who pass the PSCA are allowed to return to play.<ref name="Lamont July 2013">{{cite news|url=http://www.espn.co.uk/scotland/rugby/story/192179.html|title=Lamont: Players are cheating concussion tests|date=27 July 2013|work=ESPN Scrum|access-date=26 December 2013}}</ref>

However, an incident during the third Test of the [[2013 British & Irish Lions tour to Australia|2013 Lions tour of Australia]] led to criticism of the protocols. During that match, Australian [[George Smith (rugby union)|George Smith]] clashed heads with the Lions' [[Richard Hibbard]] and was sent to pitchside. According to ESPN's [[ESPN (UK)|UK channel]], "despite looking dazed and confused, Smith passed the PSCA and was back on the field minutes later."<ref name="Lamont July 2013" />

In 2013, former [[Scotland national rugby union team|Scotland]] international [[Rory Lamont]] charged that the established concussion protocols could easily be manipulated. A key part of the protocols is the "Cogsport" test (also known as COG), a computer-based test of cognitive function. Each player undergoes the test before the start of a new season, and is then tested again on it after a head injury, and the results compared, to determine possible impairment. According to Lamont, some players deliberately do poorly on the pre-season test, so that they will be more likely to match or beat their previous results during play.<ref name="Lamont December 2013">{{cite news|url=http://www.espnscrum.com/scrum/rugby/story/208943.html|title=Players are deliberately cheating concussion tests|last=Lamont|first=Rory|date=19 December 2013|work=ESPN Scrum|access-date=26 December 2013|author-link=Rory Lamont}}</ref>

Lamont was also critical of the PSCA, noting:
{{cquote|The problem with the PSCA is a concussed player can pass the assessment. I know from first hand experience it can be quite ineffective in deciding if a player is concussed. It is argued that allowing the five-minutes assessment is better than zero minutes but it is not as clear cut as one might hope. Concussion symptoms regularly take 10 minutes or longer to actually present. Consequently the five-minute PSCA may be giving concussed players a license to return to the field.<ref name="Lamont December 2013" />
}}
The Concussion bin was replaced by the head bin in 2012 with the players assessment taking 10 minutes.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://m.independent.ie/opinion/columnists/vincent-hogan/rugby-is-still-holding-the-concussion-bomb-with-tongs-in-spite-of-warnings-30952483.html|title=Rugby is still holding the concussion bomb with tongs in spite of warnings|newspaper=[[Irish Independent]]|access-date=13 September 2016}}</ref> If concussed the player must then recover by first returning to general activities in life, then progressing back to playing. Returning to play, the player must follow the Graduated Return to Play (GRTP) protocol, by having clearance from a medical professional, and no symptoms of concussion.

== Prevention efforts and technologies ==
There have been numerous attempts at preventing concussions, such as the establishment of the PACE (Protecting Athletes Through Concussion Education) program,<ref>[http://www.dsgpace.org/ PACE program website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120705162812/http://www.dsgpace.org/ |date=5 July 2012 }}</ref> which works with the imPACT system used by every NFL and some NHL teams {{asof|2012|lc=y}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/blogs/health/2012/06/26/drew-brees-teams-up-against-concussions-in-school-sports/ |title=Drew Brees Teams Up Against Concussions in School Sports – ABC News |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |date=26 June 2012 |access-date=4 July 2012}}</ref> In 2008, the [[Arena Football League]] tested an [[impact monitor]] created by [[Schutt Sports]] called the "Shockometer", which is a triangular device attached to the back of [[football helmet]]s that has a light on the device that turns red when a concussion occurs.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nflplayers.com/Articles/Public-News/AFL-Test-Drives-Schutt%e2%80%99s-Shockometer/ |title=AFL-Test-Drives-Schutt'S-Shockometer / News |publisher=NFLPlayers.com |date=22 May 2008 |access-date=4 July 2012}}</ref> [[Riddell Sports Group, Inc.|Riddell]] has also created the Head Impact Telemetry System (HITS) and Sideline Response System (SRS) to record the frequency and severity of player hits during practices and games.

The CCAT online tool developed by [[Axon Sports]] is another test to assist doctors in assessing concussion.

In addition to force impact sensors used to assess traumatic brain injury, studies have been conducted to assess levels of biological markers for the presence of brain concussion. A variety of concurrently researched biomarkers have been associated with concussions, including [[S100B]], [[Tau protein]] and glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP).<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Papa |first1=Linda |title=Potential Blood-Based Biomarkers for Concussion |journal=Sports Medicine and Arthroscopy Review |volume=24 |issue=3 |pages=108–15 |doi=10.1097/JSA.0000000000000117 |pmid=27482776 |pmc=5055836 |year=2016 }}</ref> In 2018, the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] approved Banyan Biomarkers Inc. to market devices involving the use of blood samples to evaluate concussions in adults.<ref>{{cite web |title=FDA authorizes marketing of first blood test to aid in the evaluation of concussion in adults |url=https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-authorizes-marketing-first-blood-test-aid-evaluation-concussion-adults |website=U.S. Food and Drug Administration |publisher=FDA|date=10 September 2019 }}</ref> Banyan BTI (Brain Trauma Indicator) is a blood sample product that the FDA permitted for use before the decision to further assess head injury with CT scanning.

Neck collar technology is being explored for more widespread use in sports since 2019. The Q-Collar (previously known as Bauer Neuroshield) is an example of such a device.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Wyman |first1=Ted |title=Bombers star linebacker Adam Bighill trying new device to protect against concussions |url=https://www.theguardian.pe.ca/sports/football/bombers-star-linebacker-adam-bighill-trying-new-device-to-protect-against-concussions-339678/ |website=The Guardian |access-date=19 November 2019}}</ref> Neck collars are designed to gently constrict blood flow through the jugular vein in the neck, increasing fluid pressure in the head.<ref name=":4" /> The aim of this technology is to allow greater cushioning for neurological structures in the event of head trauma.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Abstracts from The 35th Annual National Neurotrauma Symposium July 7–12, 2017 Snowbird, Utah |journal=Journal of Neurotrauma |date=July 2017 |volume=34 |issue=13 |pages=A–1–A-163 |doi=10.1089/neu.2017.29011.abstracts |pmid=28661788 |doi-access=free }}</ref> Despite being unable to prevent serious traumatic brain injury, the device has been associated with a protective effect against microstructural changes in the brain after regular impact.<ref name=":4">{{Cite web|url=https://www.ourcommons.ca/Content/Committee/421/SCSC/Brief/BR10488670/br-external/StefanovicDeb-e.pdf|title=The Science of Jugular Compression: A Potential Solution to Protect Athletes and Youth from Sport-Related Concussion and a Testimonial on the Use of the Q-Collar Medical Device as a Part of a Concussion Protocol Program|last=Stefanovic|first=Deb|website=Parliament of Canada}}</ref> However, further research is necessary to determine if the device's efficacy is substantiated.

Efforts to manage concussion risk in youth and high school sports include online informational resources designed for coaches and parents. For example, the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|US Centre for Disease Control]] and Prevention created the HEADS UP program, a free online informational tool. It was launched in 2007, aiming to improve concussion identification and management.<ref name=":2">{{cite journal |last1=Daugherty |first1=Jill |title=Effectiveness of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention HEADS UP coaches' online training as an educational intervention |journal=Health Education Journal |date=6 May 2019 |volume=78 |issue=7 |pages=784–797 |doi=10.1177/0017896919846185 |pmid=31530957 |pmc=6747698 }}</ref> The online tool is available on CDC's website and has been used by 2 million individuals into 2019.<ref>{{cite web |title=HEADS UP to Youth Sports |url=https://www.cdc.gov/headsup/youthsports/index.html |website=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |publisher=CDC|date=5 March 2019 }}</ref> The online resource was updated in 2016 and an interventional study conducted an assessment of the efficacy of the updated version.<ref name=":2" />

A systematic review investigated the effects of policies on preventing sports injuries of children at school (ages 4–18) including 26 policies, 14 of which were from the US, and 10 of which were concussion-specific . Of the 10 studies specific to concussion, and 6 studies on guidelines on preventing concussions. The most common recommendation for primary prevention was the "education of athletes, colleagues and the public ...". Several other guidelines included rule changes, and the adherence of rules during games. Regarding helmets, there was consensus that they may not always protect against concussions. 2 guidelines recommended the development of concussion policies, or the incorporation of concussions into existing head injury policies. Another 2 guidelines recommended supervision of sports injuries. Further research into the effectiveness of guidance for schools on concussion prevention is needed.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Göpfert |first1=Anya |last2=Van Hove |first2=Maria |last3=Emond |first3=Alan |last4=Mytton |first4=Julie |title=Prevention of sports injuries in children at school: a systematic review of pol |journal=BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine |volume=4 |date=8 April 2018 |issue=4 |pages=e000346 |doi=10.1136/bmjsem-2018-000346 |pmid=29955375 |pmc=6018845 }}</ref>

A systematic review conducted by the Social Science Research Unit in London in 2007 concluded that athletic injuries for young people (ages 12–24) are reduced under supervision by a coach, however strong evidence for interventions to reduce sports-related injuries remains lacking.<ref name=":7">{{cite book |last1=J |first1=Thomas |last2=J |first2=Kavanagh |last3=H |first3=Tucker |last4=H |first4=Burchett |last5=J |first5=Tripney |last6=A |first6=Oakley |title=Accidental injury, risk-taking behaviour and the social circumstances in which young people (aged 12-24) live: a systematic review. |date=February 2007 |publisher=Institute of Education, University of London |location=London |isbn=978-0-9551548-8-1 |pages=90–102 |url=https://eppi.ioe.ac.uk/cms/Portals/0/PDF%20reviews%20and%20summaries/Accidental%20Injury%20R%202007Thomas.pdf?ver=2010-12-21-172115-890 |access-date=1 December 2019}}</ref> As such, the authors endorse the establishment of a national sports injury database in order to strengthen the base of evidence for interventions. The review outlined several interventions to prevent injuries specific to certain sports.

=== Rugby ===
Custom-fitted mouth guards were found to be effective in 4 of 5 studies done in a review. Having the playing season in the autumn/winter decreases the risk of injury, with the highest risk occurring in the summer. Another study found a change in the rules associated with tackles, scrums and mauls decrease the number of rugby union players suffering permanent quadriplegia.<ref name=":7" />

=== Play in public playgrounds and sports fields ===
A UK-based community study found reductions in injury rates after the removal of monkey bars and increases in depth of the bark beneath equipment. A community intervention trial in New Zealand concluded the effectiveness of programs encouraging schools to reduce playground hazards. Another study found a change of environment in sports fields and playgrounds to reduce the incidence of injuries, including 'quick release bases', bases which detach easily from the ground upon contact with a player sliding, often used in recreational softball.<ref name=":7" />

=== Baseball ===
Two reviews independently concluded that modified/'break-away bases' are more effective than standard bases in the prevention of sliding-related injuries.<ref name=":7" />

=== Ice hockey ===
A review found regulatory approaches to be effective in reducing injury rates. E.g. mandatory use of protective equipment, implementation of new rules such as disallowing 'checking' from behind and 'high sticking' (raising the stick above shoulder height). A study found an inverse relationship between ice surface size and injury rate, and the use of correctly fitted helmets in injury reduction. Another review found an association between the use of face protectors and a decrease in facial injuries.<ref name=":7" />

=== Alpine skiing ===
Ten low-quality studies in a review suggested the beneficial effects of lessons for beginners, mainly composed of children and young adults.<ref name=":7" /> Numerous studies have also suggested that while helmets can be of great use in reducing the risk and severity of head injury, they have little effect on the incidence of concussions.<ref name="CJBS">{{cite journal|last1=Masson|first1=Maxime|last2=Lamoureux|first2=Julie|last3=de Guise|first3=Elaine|title=Self-reported risk-taking and sensation-seeking behavior predict helmet wear amongst Canadian ski and snowboard instructors.|journal=Canadian Journal of Behavioural Science|date=October 2019|volume=52|issue=2|pages=121–130|doi=10.1037/cbs0000153|s2cid=210359660}}</ref> [[Sensation seeking]] and [[risk-taking]] behavior appear to be two domains that need to be addressed in order to optimize prevention efforts for traumatic brain injury in this sport.<ref name="CJBS" />

=== Horse riding ===
A review found one multi-agency collaboration in publicising the risks of head injury effective in raising awareness and increasing sales of horse-riding helmets.<ref name=":7" />

=== American football ===
A review concluded that the use of face protectors is effective in decreasing facial injuries. Moreover, it was concluded that mouth guards lead to less oral and head injuries. Conflicting evidence was found for the use of knee braces.<ref name=":7" />

=== Bicycling ===
One approach to reduction of head injuries in bicycling involves developing and improving helmets in order to protect bicyclists in the event of an accident that results in a blow to the head.{{citation needed|date=May 2020}}

== Media coverage ==
Recent documentaries and films, such as ''[[Concussion (2015 film)|Concussion]]'', portray the issue as a common cause of long-term neurological disability and the direct cause of a chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a neurodegenerative tauopathy found in individuals with a history of exposure to severe or repeated head trauma.<ref name="Mannix 486–490">{{cite journal |last1=Mannix |first1=Rebekah |last2=Meehan |first2=William P. |last3=Pascual-Leone |first3=Alvaro |title=Sports-related concussions — media, science and policy |journal=Nature Reviews Neurology |date=August 2016 |volume=12 |issue=8 |pages=486–490 |doi=10.1038/nrneurol.2016.99 |pmc=5333496 |pmid=27364748 }}</ref> The increasing concern over the potential long-term effects of sport-related concussions has heightened scrutiny of the practice of collision sports, particularly American football, with some individuals advocating for its abolition.<ref name="Mannix 486–490" />

Terminology in media for sports related concussions differs based on the geographical location. Articles in America used the descriptors "head trauma" (11.7%) and "brain trauma" (6.8%) the most, while articles from the UK and Ireland primarily mentioned "blow to head" (22.2%). Australia used the descriptors "head injury" (57.1%), and "brain injury" (28.6%) the most while New Zealand used "head knock" (46.7%), "head clash" (13.3%), and "brain damage" (13.3%). For the consequences of concussion, the UK and Ireland mentioned "Second Impact Syndrome "(22.2%), "Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy" (22.2%) and "Parkinson's disease and other neurological conditions" (11.1%) the most. America most commonly mentioned "Alzheimer's, dementia and neurocognitive problems" (13.6%) and "Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis" (11.7%), while Canada saw the most frequent mention of "depression and suicide" (10.5%).<ref name="Ahmed 7–13" /> Also, the use of misleading terms such as "mild concussion", "minor concussion" and "slight concussion" are commonplace in the media.<ref name="Ahmed 7–13" /> Although media articles are often written by individuals (i.e. journalists) who are not medically trained, these articles have been found to potentially influence perceptions regarding concussion for a wide audience due to the global reach of the internet.

In 2012, film producer [[Steve James (producer)|Steve James]] created the documentary film ''[[Head Games (film)|Head Games]]'', interviewing former NHL player [[Keith Primeau]], and the parents of Owen Thomas, who hanged himself after sustaining brain damage during his football career at [[Penn Quakers football|Penn]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://athleticbusiness.com/articles/lexisnexis.aspx?lnarticleid=1679642947&lntopicid=136030023 |title='Head Games' Film Focuses on Concussions, Asks If Enough is Being Done |publisher=Athleticbusiness.com |access-date=14 July 2012}}</ref> The documentary also interviewed former athletes [[Christopher Nowinski]], [[Cindy Parlow Cone|Cindy Parlow]], and ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' reporter [[Alan Schwarz]], among other athletes, journalists, and medical researchers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://headgamesthefilm.com/people/ |title=Head Games: The People |publisher=Headgamesthefilm.com |access-date=14 July 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120618131154/http://www.headgamesthefilm.com/people/ |archive-date=18 June 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

''[[League of Denial]]'' was a 2013 book by sports reporters [[Mark Fainaru-Wada]] and [[Steve Fainaru]] about concussions within the NFL. The American documentary series ''[[Frontline (U.S. TV series)|Frontline]]'' covered the topic in two episodes, one based on the book and also called "[[League of Denial]]",<ref>[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/league-of-denial/ League of Denial]</ref> and the other called "Football High"<ref>[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/football-high/ Football High]</ref> Political sports journalist [[Dave Zirin]] has also covered the topic in detail.<ref>[http://billmoyers.com/episode/full-show-the-collision-of-sports-and-politics/ The Collision of Sports and Politics]</ref>
