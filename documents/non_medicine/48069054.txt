{{short description|Part of the larger Native American mascot controversy}}
'''Sports teams named Redskins''' are part of the larger [[Native American mascot controversy|controversy]] regarding the use of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] names, images and symbols by non-native sports teams. Teams of this name have received particular public attention because the term ''[[redskin]]'' is now generally regarded as disparaging and offensive.<ref name=OED>{{Cite OED|redskin}}</ref><ref name=mw>{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/redskin|title=Definition of REDSKIN|publisher=Merriam-Webster| quote=Definition of REDSKIN (usually offensive): american indian| accessdate=November 7, 2014}}</ref><ref name=ahd>{{cite book|url=http://ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=redskin| title=The American Heritage® Dictionary of the English Language, Fifth Edition| year=2011| publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing Company| quote=n.

The most prominent team of this name was the Washington Redskins of the [[National Football League]] (NFL), which had been at the center of [[Washington Redskins name controversy|several campaigns]] to change the name. After decades of defending the name, amid the [[List of name changes due to the George Floyd protests|removal of many names and images]] associated with systemic racism as part of the [[George Floyd protests]], Washington yielded to pressure from investors and sponsors and retired the branding in 2020.<ref name="McDonald.Newsweek.2020">{{cite magazine|last=McDonald|first=Scott|title=Washington Redskins Urged to Lose Name, or Millions in Sponsorships|url=https://www.newsweek.com/washington-redskins-urged-lose-name-millions-sponsorships-1514894|magazine=[[Newsweek]]|date=July 1, 2020|access-date=July 3, 2020}}</ref><ref name="Washington Post">{{cite news |last1=Clarke |first1=Liz |title=FedEx calls on Redskins to change name following investors' demands on sponsors |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2020/07/02/fedex-redskins-name-change/ |newspaper=Washington Post |date=July 2, 2020 |language=en}}</ref> The team temporarily played as the Washington Football Team before rebranding as the Commanders in 2022.<ref name="WaPo.2.2.22">{{cite news| title=Washington Football Team announces 'Commanders' as its new name| first=Nicki | last=Jhabvala| newspaper=The Washington Post| date=February 2, 2022| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2022/02/02/washington-football-team-new-name/| access-date=February 2, 2022}}</ref>

The college sports teams using the name changed voluntarily prior to the [[NCAA Native American mascot decision]] in 2005; the [[University of Utah]] became [[Utah Utes]] in 1972, [[Miami University| Miami University of Ohio]] became the [[Miami RedHawks|RedHawks]] in 1997 and the [[Southern Nazarene University]] became the [[Southern Nazarene Crimson Storm|Crimson Storm]] in 1998.

The [[South Eastern Manitoba Hockey League]] team that was formerly the Morden Redskins was renamed Morden Bombers in 2020.<ref>{{Cite web| last = Malone| first = Kelly Geraldine| title = Morden, Man., senior hockey team changes derogatory name to Bombers| work = CBC| access-date = 2023-08-09| date = 2020-10-20| url = https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/morden-hockey-team-name-change-bombers-1.5769699}}</ref>

Several high schools have followed the example of the Washington NFL team and agreed to change their names. Other high school and youth teams continue to use the name, though the number has been steadily declining. Defenders of the Redskins name, both nationally and locally, cite their tradition, and the pride they feel in their team, while calls for change are often dismissed as [[political correctness]]. The [[National Congress of American Indians]] (NCAI) database tracks 89 K-12 schools in 40 school districts with the Redskins mascot.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ncai.org/NCAI_School_Mascot_Tracking_Database_-_Overview_and_Numbers.pdf | title=National School Mascot Tracking Database - Overview| website=NCAI| access-date=November 30, 2022}}</ref>

==Meaning of redskin==
{{main|Redskin}}

''Redskin'' is one of the color terms for race that emerged in the [[colonial history of the United States|colonial period]] as Native Americans encountered people who called themselves "white" and their slaves "black". The use of "red" as an identifier by Native Americans for themselves emerged in the context of Indian-European diplomacy in the southeastern region of North America, before later being adopted by Europeans.<ref name="Shoemaker.1997">{{cite journal |url=https://peopleofonefire.com/how_indians_got_to_be_red.pdf | last=Shoemaker| first=Nancy| title=How Indians Got to Be Red| journal=The American Historical Review| volume=102| issue=3| date=1997| pages=625–644| doi=10.2307/2171504| jstor=2171504}}</ref>{{rp|627–8}} The choice of red rather than other colors may have been due to cultural associations rather than skin color; the red/white dichotomy having symbolic meaning for Native Americans in the southeast.<ref name="Shoemaker.1997"/>{{rp|632}} Usage in the northeast region by Europeans may have been largely limited to descriptions of tribes such as the [[Beothuk]] of Newfoundland, whose practice of painting their bodies and possessions with [[red ochre]] led Europeans to refer to them as "Red Indians".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.historica.ca/the_beothuk.php |title=The Beothuk Indians - "Newfoundland's Red Ochre People" |work=Historica Canadiana |date=6 December 2006}}</ref> The origin of the term "redskin" is debated.

== Mascot controversy ==
{{main|Native American mascot controversy}}
In the early 20th century, sports teams began adopting Native American-themed names, including "Redskins". [[Miami University]] in Ohio and [[Huntley High School]] in [[Huntley, Illinois]] started using the "Redskins" name in 1928.<ref>{{cite book |last= Stapleton |first= Bruce |year = 2001 |title= Redskins: Racial Slur Or Symbol of Success?|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Isj8cHpz3zQC&q=redskins+%22high+school%22&pg=PA116 |publisher= Writer's Club Press |page= 115 |isbn=978-0595171675 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last= Guiliano|first= Jennifer |year=2015 |title= Indian Spectacle: College Mascots and the Anxiety of Modern America |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=nzx_CgAAQBAJ| publisher= Rutgers University Press|pages= 59–69|isbn= 978-0813565569}}</ref> In 1933, the Boston Braves of the [[National Football League]] changed their name to the [[Boston Redskins]]; the team states that this was done in honor of Native Americans on the team, although owner [[George Preston Marshall]] said at the time it was done to avoid confusion with the [[Boston Braves (baseball)|Boston Braves]] baseball team. This team became the Washington Redskins by relocating to [[Washington, D.C.]] in 1937.<ref name=WaPo/>

Native American mascots are often discussed in the media in terms of offensiveness, which reduces it to feelings and opinions, and prevents full understanding of the history and context of the use of Native American names and images and why their use by sports teams should be eliminated.<ref name="handbook">{{cite book|editor=C.

In 2005, the [[American Psychological Association]] issued a resolution "Recommending the Immediate Retirement of American Indian Mascots, Symbols, Images, and Personalities by Schools, Colleges, Universities, Athletic Teams, and Organizations" due to the harm done by creating a hostile environment, the negative impact on the self-esteem of American Indian children, and discrimination that may violate civil rights. It also impacts non-natives by reinforcing mainstream stereotypes, preventing learning about Native American culture.

===Washington Redskins===
{{main|Washington Redskins name controversy}}
Native American individuals, tribes and organizations have been questioning the use of the name and image for decades. In the 1940s the [[National Congress of American Indians]] (NCAI) created a campaign to eliminate negative stereotyping of Native American people in the media. Over time, the campaign began to focus on Indian names and mascots in sports.<ref>{{cite journal|author=J Gordon Hylton|title=BEFORE THE REDSKINS WERE THE REDSKINS: THE USE OF NATIVE AMERICAN TEAM NAMES IN THE FORMATIVE ERA OF AMERICAN SPORTS, 1857–1933|journal=North Dakota Law Review| date=2010-01-01| volume=86| page=879}}</ref> The NCAI maintains that teams with Indian mascots [[Defamation|defame]] Native American people, perpetuate negative stereotypes and demeaning their native traditions and rituals.<ref name="NCAI">{{cite web|url=http://www.ncai.org/policy-issues/community-and-culture/anti-defamation-mascots|title=Anti-Defamation and Mascots|publisher=National Congress of American Indians|accessdate=12 January 2013}}</ref> The NCAI issued a new report in 2013 summarizing opposition to Indian mascots and team names generally, and the Washington Redskins in particular.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncai.org/news/articles/2013/10/10/ncai-releases-report-on-history-and-legacy-of-washington-s-harmful-indian-sports-mascot|title=NCAI Releases Report on History and Legacy of Washington's Harmful "Indian" Sports Mascot|accessdate=October 11, 2013}}</ref>

In response to the controversy, the team owner Dan Snyder sent an open letter to fans that was published in ''The Washington Post'' in October 2013. In the letter Snyder states that the most important meaning of the name Redskins is the association that fans have to memories of their personal history with the team. Snyder also states that the name was chosen in 1933 to honor Native Americans in general and the coach and four players at that time who were Native American; and that in 1971 the then coach George Allen consulted with the Red Cloud Athletic Fund on the Pine Ridge reservation when designing the logo.<ref name="snyder">{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/letter-from-washington-redskins-owner-dan-snyder-to-fans/2013/10/09/e7670ba0-30fe-11e3-8627-c5d7de0a046b_story.html|title=Letter from Washington Redskins owner Dan Snyder to fans|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=October 9, 2013|author=Michelle Boorstein}}</ref>

On its official website in early 2013, the [[Washington Redskins]] posted articles referring to high school teams using the same name (and often the same logo).

====Recent changes====
The Cooperstown Central School Board of Education in [[Cooperstown, New York]], voted 6–1 on March 6, 2013, to remove the Redskins mascot from its interscholastic athletic, extracurricular and academic programs. The move was prompted by a vote by the student body, asking that the mascot be changed. The [[Oneida Indian Nation]] was so moved by the actions of the Cooperstown students, that a letter by Oneida Nation Representative Ray Halbritter was written to the students, commending their decision and offering to make a contribution to help offset the cost of changing mascots.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oneidaindiannation.com/pressroom/latestnews/Oneida-Indian-Nation-Congratulates-Cooperstown-Central-School-Board-for-Voting-to-Remove-Redskins-Mascot-196067191.html|title=Oneida Indian Nation Congratulates Cooperstown Central School Board for Voting to Remove Redskins Mascot|date=March 7, 2013|accessdate=March 14, 2013| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141020014424/http://www.oneidaindiannation.com/pressroom/latestnews/Oneida-Indian-Nation-Congratulates-Cooperstown-Central-School-Board-for-Voting-to-Remove-Redskins-Mascot-196067191.html|archive-date=October 20, 2014}}</ref>

The name of the [[Lancaster High School (Lancaster, New York)|Lancaster, New York High School]] team was discussed at a school board meeting in January 2015. "Of all the words that could be used to describe us, 'Redskin' is the worst, said John Kane, talk show host for the First Voices Indigenous Radio Network". The school has de-emphasized the Redskins name in recent years, eliminating the name and logo from the scoreboard and uniforms. However, two former school board members defend the name, citing it as "a source of community identity, pride and spirit". Kane characterized the defense of the name as having an "[[Archie Bunker]]" mentality. "In this day and age, it's not a celebratory term," said Hilary N. Weaver, associate dean for academic affairs at the [[University at Buffalo]] and co-director of the Immigrant and Refugee Research Institute. "You're a school district, and it's important to look at what you're teaching. … I don't think racism has a place in an educational institution."<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.buffalonews.com/city-region/lancaster/redskins-nickname-is-debated-in-lancaster-20150121| title=Redskins nickname is debated in Lancaster| author=Karen Robinson| date=January 21, 2015| newspaper=Buffalo News}}</ref> The name was again debated at the Lancaster school on March 3, 2015, and was defended by many, but not all current and former students.

With the agreement of the local government, Chowchilla has added "Redskins Way" signs to the streets leading to the school and insist they are maintaining a proud tradition that honors Native Americans, even as tribal members state that these practices trivialize and misrepresent the factual history of Native Americans in California.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://edsource.org/2017/mascot-law-rolls-out-and-schools-obey-the-letter-of-the-law-if-not-the-spirit/575473| title=Mascot law rolls out and schools obey the letter of the law, if not the spirit| date=January 23, 2017| author=Jane Meredith Adams| publisher=EdSource}}</ref>

====Opposition to change====
=====Neshaminy High School, Pennsylvania=====

In 2013, after failing in her appeals directly to [[Neshaminy High School]], a parent, Donna Fann-Boyle (Cherokee-Choctaw) filed a complaint with the [[Pennsylvania]] Human Relations Commission (PHRC) alleging the "Redskins" name is a form of harassment offensive to Native Americans and her then 13-year-old son who attended the school. The school board unanimously voted to ask the commission to dismiss the complaint.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.myfoxphilly.com/story/23785675/parent-asks-school-to-change-mascot-name|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103225824/http://www.myfoxphilly.com/story/23785675/parent-asks-school-to-change-mascot-name |archive-date=November 3, 2013|title=Parent Asks School To Change Mascot Name|date=October 25, 2013|author=Omari Fleming|publisher=Fox News}}</ref>

======School newspaper======
After hearing Fann-Boyle's and other Native Americans, editors of the student newspaper, the [[Neshaminy High School#Playwickian|Playwickian]], voted 14–7 to stop using the name.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.mcall.com/2013-10-25/news/mc-pa-neshaminy-school-redskin-controversy-20131025_1_student-newspaper-native-americans-editorial|title=Student newspaper to stop using school's 'Redskin' nickname|date=October 25, 2013|author=Christian Menno|newspaper=The Morning Call}}</ref> An editorial by the majority stated "The word 'Redskin' is racist, and very much so.

The principal and the school board president decided that the student newspaper's editorial board did not have the right to refuse to use the name.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2013/11/15/neshaminy-high-school-152276|title=Neshaminy High School's Editorial Board Challenged on Nixing 'Redskins'|date=November 15, 2013}}</ref> The school board reached a compromise policy in which the name would not be entirely banned, but allowed in editorials and letters to the editor; however the editors of the paper and their attorney maintain that this policy is contrary to state law and the [[United States Constitution|US Constitution]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.buckscountycouriertimes.com/news/local/neshaminy-board-passes-controversial-playwickian-policy/article_0f94aa14-3749-586c-930a-7d2e8c91ff78.html|title=Neshaminy board passes controversial Playwickian policy|date=June 26, 2014|author=MICHAEL MACAGNONE|newspaper=The Bucks County Courier Times}}</ref>

The Playwickian refusal to print the name came to a head when a student in favor of remaining Redskins submitted an editorial, which the paper printed with the name redacted. The principal eventually suspended the paper's faculty adviser, Tara Huber, for two days, and suspended editor-in-chief from her duties. The paper's funding was also cut by the approximate cost of the redacted issue.<ref name="Sinn.20171219">{{cite news| first=Dylan| last=Sinn| title=School paper becomes flashpoint in debate over 'Redskins'| agency=Capitol News Service| publisher=[[Philip Merrill College of Journalism]]| date=December 19, 2017| url=http://cnsmaryland.org/2017/12/19/school-paper-becomes-flashpoint-in-debate-over-redskins/ | accessdate=December 20, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.splc.org/article/2014/09/playwickian-adviser-student-editor-suspended-for-redskins-ban|title=Playwickian adviser, student editor suspended for defying administrative orders with Redskins ban|author=Anna Schiffbauer|date=September 17, 2014|publisher=Student Press Law Center}}</ref> The faculty adviser, Tara Huber was named Journalism Teacher of the Year in 2014 by the Pennsylvania School Press Association.
