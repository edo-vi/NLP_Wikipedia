== Career ==
=== Early career ===
Valieva began skating in 2009 in RSDUSSHOR in Kazan. Ksenia Ivanova first coached her, followed by [[Marina Kudriavtseva]] and Igor Lyutikov, and Natalia Dubinskaya.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDzS6yce1T8|date=7 August 2019|title=Kamila VALIEVA ‚Äì Interview, Control skatings (Novogorsk 08/2019) [ENG Subs]|publisher=YouTube|access-date=22 October 2020|archive-date=8 June 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200608184525/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDzS6yce1T8&gl=US&hl=en|url-status=live}}</ref> When she turned six, her parents moved her to Moscow to train at SSHOR Moskvich. In the spring of 2018, Valieva switched skating clubs to Sambo-70, where [[Eteri Tutberidze]] decided to allow Valieva to join her group.<ref name="ifsmagazine"/> Videos are available of Valieva‚Äôs first competition at age 4<ref name="YouTube n950">{{cite web | title=Kamilla Valieva // first competition 2010 | website=YouTube | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UewI03EkDY | access-date=4 September 2023}}</ref> as well as a later one at age 9.<ref name="YouTube a320">{{cite web | title= Kamila Valieva KP Moscow Championship ML Age 2015 | website=YouTube | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBdaSmq5S-0 | access-date=4 September 2023}}</ref>

In the 2018‚Äì19 season, before her international debut, recordings of Valieva's short program, set to ''[[Spiegel im Spiegel]]'' by [[Arvo P√§rt]] and inspired by [[Pablo Picasso]]'s painting ''[[Girl on a Ball]]'', received worldwide attention. Tutberidze described it as her favorite program of the year.<ref name="ifsmagazine"/> The program also drew the notice of Picasso's granddaughter [[Diana Widmaier Picasso]], who invited Valieva to visit her in Paris.<ref name="ifsmagazine"/> Among other victories that season, she won the Russian Younger Age Championships ahead of training mates [[Sofia Akatieva]] and [[Sofia Samodelkina]].<ref name="nationals2019"/> It was later announced that Valieva would keep her short program for her international debut in the upcoming season.

=== 2019‚Äì2020 season: Junior World champion ===
[[File:2019-2020 ISU Junior Grand Prix Final Kamila Valieva 2019 12 05 0782.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Valieva at the [[2019‚Äì20 Grand Prix of Figure Skating Final|2019‚Äì20 Junior Grand Prix Final]]]]
Valieva's international debut came in late August 2019 at a [[2019‚Äì20 ISU Junior Grand Prix|Junior Grand Prix]] competition in [[Courchevel]], France. Ranked third in the short program and first in the free skate, she won the gold medal ahead of [[Wi Seo-yeong]] of South Korea and teammate and training partner [[Maiia Khromykh]].<ref name=JGPFRA2019/> At the competition, Valieva became the second female skater ever to land a [[quad (figure skating)|quadruple]] [[toe loop]] in competition.<ref name=JGPFRA2019JD/> Her total score at the event was the [[List of highest junior scores in figure skating#Best total scores 2|fourth highest score]] achieved by a ladies' single skater at the junior level, behind teammates [[Alexandra Trusova]], [[Anna Shcherbakova]], and [[Alena Kostornaia]]. Valieva also became the fourth junior lady to score above 200 points under the current GOE (Grade of Execution) system.<ref name="ISU-highestscores"/>

One month later, at the [[ISU Junior Grand Prix in Russia|2020 JGP Russia]], she placed first in both programs with personal best scores to take the title ahead of compatriots [[Ksenia Sinitsyna]] and [[Viktoria Vasilieva]].<ref name="JGPRUS2019"/> She attempted two quadruple toe loops in the free skate for the first time, landing one.<ref name="JGPRUS2019JD"/> With two gold medals, she qualified in first place to the [[2019‚Äì20 Grand Prix of Figure Skating Final|2019‚Äì20 Junior Grand Prix Final]] in [[Turin]], Italy.<ref name="JGPF2019"/>

Before the 2019‚Äì20 Junior Grand Prix Final in December, a minor injury prevented Valieva from training the quadruple toe loop jump. She entered the final as a co-favorite for the title along with [[Alysa Liu]] of the United States. After placing fourth in the short program, Valieva delivered a clean free skate to take the title ahead of Liu, who dropped from first place in the short program after under-rotating a triple [[Axel jump|Axel]] and both of her quad [[Lutz jump|Lutzes]], and training mate [[Daria Usacheva]].<ref name="IFS200114"/>

At 13 years old, Valieva was too young to enter the [[2020 Russian Figure Skating Championships|2020 Russian Championships]] as a senior in December. In early February, Valieva instead competed at the [[2020 Russian Figure Skating Championships|2020 Russian Junior Championships]], which she won after placing first in both programs ahead of Akatieva and Usacheva.<ref name="nationals2020"/> She once again included two quadruple toe loop jumps in her free skate, after recovering from her previous injury, stepping out on one and landing another in combination with a double toe loop.<ref name="nats2020jd"/> After the competition, she was named to the Russian team for the [[2020 World Junior Figure Skating Championships|2020 World Junior Championships]] along with teammates Usacheva, who placed third, and Khromykh, who placed fifth; silver medalist Akatieva and fourth-place finisher [[Sofia Samodelkina]] were too young to be eligible.<ref name="JWC2020-team"/>

The 2020 World Junior Championships were again seen by many as a showdown between Valieva and Liu, who had recently defended her title at the senior-level [[2020 U.S. Figure Skating Championships|2020 U.S. Championships]]. Valieva placed first in the short program ahead of [[Lee Hae-in (figure skater)|Lee Hae-in]] of South Korea and Usacheva, setting a new personal best. Her score of 74.92 points was the second-highest short program score ever for a junior lady, only behind Kostornaia's short program at the [[2018‚Äì19 Grand Prix of Figure Skating Final|2018‚Äì19 Junior Grand Prix Final]].<ref name=GS200306/> In the free skate, she performed similarly to the Russian Junior Championships, stepping out on her opening quadruple toe loop and landing all other jumps cleanly, including a second quadruple toe loop in combination. She won the title and became the new Junior World Champion, ahead of Usacheva and Liu. Valieva remarked afterward, "there was a little mistake on the toe loop, but basically, I am pleased with my performance."<ref name=GS200307/>

=== 2020‚Äì2021 season ===
[[File:2021-02-27 - 2021 Russian Cup Final - Kamila Valieva SP (Eric Radford's Storm).ogv|thumb|right|Valieva skating her short program at the [[Russian Figure Skating Cup|2021 Russian Cup Final]]]]
Valieva skated at the 2020 Russian test skates in [[Moscow]], showcasing her new programs for the 2020‚Äì21 season. She executed a quad toe combination in her free skate.<ref name=OC200914/> She competed at the second stage of the [[Russian Figure Skating Cup|Russian Cup]]. There, she skated cleanly, placing first in the short program but third in the free skate due to several unexpected mistakes. She won the silver medal.<ref name=OC200914/> She later competed at the fifth stage of the Russian Cup. There, she placed first in the short program, with one step out on a triple Axel attempt. In the free skate, she also placed first, completing two quadruple toe loops (one in combination) and with only one mistake on a triple Lutz. She placed first, winning the gold medal with one of the highest total scores in Russian domestic competition.<ref name=IFS-Cup2020/>

Making her senior [[2021 Russian Figure Skating Championships|Russian Championships]] debut, Valieva placed second in the short program despite falling on her triple Axel.<ref name=GS201225/> She also placed second in the free skate with two clean quads landed, and, despite an underrotated triple [[Flip jump|flip]], won the silver medal.<ref name=GS201226/>

Following the national championships, Valieva participated in the [[2021 Channel One Trophy]], a televised team competition organized in lieu of the canceled [[2021 European Figure Skating Championships|European Championships]]. Selected to the Red Machine team by captain [[Alina Zagitova]], Valieva won both the short program and free skates, helping her team win the trophy.<ref name=OC210206/><ref name=OC210207/> At her final event of the season, Valieva participated in the senior Russian Cup Final, winning the short program by a wide margin.<ref name=OC210227/> In the free skate, she attempted a quadruple [[Salchow jump|Salchow]] in competition for the first time but fell and made additional errors on both quad toe loop attempts. As a result, she finished third in the segment; however, the strength of her short program score allowed her to win the overall event by 2.04 points over teammate Maiia Khromykh.<ref name=OC210228/>

=== 2021‚Äì2022 season: Beijing Olympics===
Valieva made her international senior debut at the [[2021 CS Finlandia Trophy]]. She placed third in the short program after falling on her triple Axel attempt. In her free skate, she landed three quad jumps, recording a world record score of 174.31 points, also setting a new world record for total points (249.24).<ref name=Finlandia2021/>

Making her senior [[2021‚Äì22 ISU Grand Prix of Figure Skating|Grand Prix]] debut at the [[2021 Skate Canada International]], Valieva won the short program with a new personal best score of 84.19, 2.95 points ahead of [[Elizaveta Tuktamysheva]] in second place. She skated a clean program in the free skate with three quads and only one minor mistake in her triple Axel. Once again, she set a new world record for the women's free skate (180.89) and a total score (265.08).<ref name=GS211031/>‚ÄÉValieva's second assignment of the season was the [[2021 Rostelecom Cup]], held this year at [[Sochi]]'s [[Iceberg Skating Palace]], the host venue for skating events at the [[2014 Winter Olympics]], instead of in Moscow as usual. In the short program, she scored 87.42 points, breaking Alena Kostornaia's previous world record of 85.45. She went on to raise the world records in the free skate (185.29) and total score (272.71).
Valieva's results qualified her to the [[2021‚Äì22 Grand Prix of Figure Skating Final|Grand Prix Final]], which was subsequently canceled due to travel and gathering restrictions prompted by the spread of the [[SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant|Omicron variant]] of SARS-CoV-2 during the [[COVID-19 pandemic]].<ref name=CBC211202/>

On 24 December, Valieva placed first in the short program at the [[2022 Russian Figure Skating Championships|2022 Russian Championships]], nearly 10 points ahead of Shcherbakova in second place. She scored 193.10 for her free skate, with a gold medal-winning score of 283.48 points, nearly 35 points ahead of silver medalist Alexandra Trusova. She remarked afterward, "I did almost my maximum."<ref name=GS211225/> As national champion, she was guaranteed a berth on the [[Russian Olympic Committee athletes at the 2022 Winter Olympics|Russian Olympic team]].<ref name=OC211225/> Valieva made her [[2022 European Figure Skating Championships|European Championships]] debut in January 2022 in [[Tallinn]], Estonia. She finished first in the short program with a clean skate and extended her world record score by over three points to become the first woman to break the 90-point barrier.<ref name=OC220113/> In the free skate, Valieva fell on her triple Axel attempt for the second time in competition this season but skated the rest of her program cleanly to narrowly win the segment over teammates Shcherbakova and Trusova and take the European title.<ref name=GS220115/> On 20 January, she was officially named to the Russian Olympic team.<ref name=OC220120/>

Selected as the Russian entry in the women's segments of the [[Figure skating at the 2022 Winter Olympics ‚Äì Team event|Olympic team event]], Valieva began the [[2022 Winter Olympics]] with a first-place finish in the short program with a clean triple Axel, scoring near her own world record. Valieva placed four ordinals above American skater [[Karen Chen]], moving the Russian team into first place in the competition at the end of the short program segments.<ref name=GS220206/> She was chosen for the women's free skate in the team event as well, winning the segment with a program that included two clean quadruple jumps (Salchow and toe loop) and a triple Axel, albeit with a fall on a second quadruple toe loop attempt. Her score was over 30 points clear of second-place finisher [[Kaori Sakamoto]] of Japan.<ref name=GS220207/> Valieva became the first woman to land a quadruple jump at the Olympic Games.<ref name=CNN220207/> The ROC team won the team event, but the medal ceremony was postponed pending an official investigation of filed allegations concerning possible doping, though Valieva was permitted to compete while the investigation is still in progress.

During the short program in the [[Figure skating at the 2022 Winter Olympics ‚Äì Women's singles|women's singles event]] at the Winter Olympics on 15 February, Valieva placed first ahead of Russian compatriot Shcherbakova despite faltering during a triple Axel though not falling.<ref name=GS220215/> During the free skate on 17 February, she stumbled or fell at least four times as she skated to ''[[Bol√©ro]]''. She wept as she left the ice and did not earn a place in the top three, finishing in fourth place behind her compatriots Shcherbakova and Trusova, who came first and second, and bronze medalist Sakamoto.<ref name=WP220217/> All three ROC skaters landed quads in their routines, the only women at the Olympics to do so.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Brandon Penny ‚Ä¢ |title=How Many Quads Will We See in the Women's Free Skate? |url=https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/sports/beijing-winter-olympics/how-many-quads-will-we-see-in-the-womens-free-skate/2762009/ |access-date=27 February 2022 |website=NBC Chicago |language=en-US}}</ref> In early March 2022, the IOC and ISU banned all figure skaters and officials from Russia and Belarus from attending the World Championships due to [[2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine|Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine]] therefore not allowing Valieva to participate in the competition in France at the end of March.<ref name=ISU220301>{{cite web|url=https://isu.org/isu-news/news/145-news/14024-isu-statement-on-the-ukrainian-crisis-participation-in-international-competitions-of-skaters-and-officials-from-russia-and-belarus?templateParam=15|title= ISU Statement on the Ukrainian crisis ‚Äì Participation in international competitions of Skaters and Officials from Russia and Belarus|publisher=[[International Skating Union]]|date=1 March 2022}}</ref>

On 25‚Äì27 March, Valieva participated in [[2022 Channel One Trophy]], a Russian domestic competition. During the short program, she did not perform any triple axle as she always did; instead, she cleanly jumped a double axle and scored 83.63 into first place. During free skating, Valieva cleanly jumped a quadruple toe-loop and scored 173.88 in the second place behind [[Anna Shcherbakova]].

On 13 January 2023, the [[Russian Anti-Doping Agency]] (RUSADA) stripped Valieva of her gold medal in senior women's singles of the [[2022 Russian Figure Skating Championships]] stemming from her positive test for [[trimetazidine]], a [[List of drugs banned by the World Anti-Doping Agency|banned substance]], on the second day of the Women's competition. The organization said that "Valieva had no fault in the positive drug test". However, RUSADA refused to strip her Olympic gold medal in the team event, prompting WADA to file a case to the [[Court of Arbitration for Sport]]. It was suspected that RUSADA decision was a 'half-measure' intended to preserve Russia's Olympic gold medal.<ref>[https://olympics.nbcsports.com/2023/01/13/kamila-valieva-doping-case-rusada-wada/ Kamila Valiyeva had ‚Äòno fault‚Äô in drug test case, Russian Anti-Doping Agency says]</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=WADA statement on RUSADA finding in ROC skater case / D√©claration de l'AMA sur la conclusion de RUSADA dans le cas d'une patineuse du ROC |url=https://us15.campaign-archive.com/?u=b1807e279506be6f85bf0da1c&id=9c3312e70a&e=31d37d73e1 |access-date=2023-01-13 |publisher=[[World Anti-Doping Agency]]}}</ref> Subsequently, [[Alexandra Trusova]] became the gold medalist of the 2022 Russian Championships, with [[Anna Shcherbakova]] moving up to silver and [[Adeliia Petrosian]] receiving the bronze medal.

==Official probe into allegations of doping and misconduct==
Ostensibly, a matter of allegations concerning misconduct by Valieva began on 25 December 2021, when Valieva submitted a routine urine sample for analysis following her win at the Russian Nationals on 24 December. The normal 20-day testing time for the sample lapsed, apparently due to [[COVID-19]] related backlogs at the testing laboratory; however, the positive doping test results were eventually forwarded for evaluation in February 2022, after the Beijing Olympics had started, and the [[Figure skating at the 2022 Winter Olympics ‚Äì Team event|team event]] had concluded.<ref name=Reuters>{{Cite news|last1=T√©trault-Farber|first1=Gabrielle|last2=Axon|first2=Iain|last3=Grohmann|first3=Karolos|date=9 February 2022|title=Figure skating-Russian media say teen star tested positive for banned drug|language=en|work=[[Reuters]]|url=https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/sports/figure-skating-medals-ceremony-delayed-over-legal-consultation-2022-02-09/|access-date=9 February 2022}}</ref><ref name=usatoday-09Feb22-Brennan>{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/beijing/2022/02/09/olympic-figure-skating-team-medals-delayed-russian-drug-test/6717526001/|title=Positive drug test by Russian Kamila Valieva has forced a delay of Olympic team medals ceremony|first=Christine|last=Brennan|author-link=Christine Brennan|website=[[USA Today]]|date=9 February 2022}}</ref> On 14 November 2022, the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) registered an appeal by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) about a possible violation of anti-doping rules by Russian figure skater Kamila Valieva.<ref>{{Cite web|language=en|url=https://tass.com/sport/1536357|title=CAS registers WADA's appeal against Russian figure skater Valieva|website=tass.com|date=14 November 2022}}</ref>

===During Beijing Olympics===
The medal ceremony for the team event, in which the ROC won gold, was originally scheduled for 8 February but was delayed over what [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) spokesperson Mark Adams described as a situation that required "legal consultation" with the [[International Skating Union]] (ISU).<ref>{{Cite web|date=9 February 2022|title=Olympic medals in team figure skating delayed by legal issue|url=https://apnews.com/article/winter-olympics-figure-skating-sports-international-olympic-committee-court-of-arbitration-for-sport-c49077705737be8a7d41a2847c2f355b|access-date=9 February 2022|website=[[The Associated Press|AP News]]|language=en}}</ref> Several media outlets reported on 9 February that the issue was a positive test by Valieva for the banned substance [[trimetazidine]],<ref name=Reuters/><ref name=usatoday-09Feb22-Brennan/> which was officially confirmed on 11 February.<ref>{{cite news|last=Thompson|first=Anna|date=11 February 2022|title=Winter Olympics: Kamila Valieva failed drug test confirmed|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/winter-olympics/60329120.amp|work=[[BBC Sport]]|access-date=12 February 2022}}</ref> The sample in question was taken by the [[Russian Anti-Doping Agency]] (RUSADA) at the [[2022 Russian Figure Skating Championships]] on 25 December 2021.

The sample was analyzed at the Doping Control Laboratory at Stockholm's [[Karolinska University Hospital]], a [[World Anti-Doping Agency]] (WADA)-accredited lab. The test result came one day after the team event concluded.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Pretot|first1=Julien|date=12 February 2022|title=Mitigating factors in six-week delay for Valieva's test result|language=en|work=Reuters|url=https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/sports/mitigating-factors-six-week-delay-valievas-test-result-2022-02-12//}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/10/sports/olympics/kamila-valieva-trimetazidine.html|title=Star Russian Figure Skater Tested Positive for Banned Drug|first1=Juliet|last1=Macur|author-link1=Juliet Macur|first2=Andrew|last2=Keh|website=[[The New York Times]]|date=12 February 2022}}</ref>

On 14 February, the CAS declined to reinstate Valieva's provisional suspension and ruled that she would be allowed to compete in the women's singles event. The CAS decided that preventing her from competing "would cause her irreparable harm in the circumstances" while noting that any medals won by Valieva at the Beijing Olympics would be withheld pending the results of the continuing investigation into her doping violation. The accommodating decision from the court, subject to further and ongoing investigation, was made on three grounds: due to her age, she was a "protected person" per WADA code, subject to different rules than adult athletes; she "did not test positive during the Olympic Games in Beijing"; and "There were serious issues of untimely notification of the results ... which impinged upon the Athlete's ability to establish certain legal requirements for her benefit".<ref>{{cite web|date=14 February 2022|title=Russian skater Kamila Valieva cleared to compete at Olympics|url=https://apnews.com/article/winter-olympics-kamila-valieva-doping-decision-0dd063b5092681697525b69cd0c7212d|access-date=14 February 2022|website=[[Associated Press]]|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite press release|url=https://www.tas-cas.org/fileadmin/user_upload/CAS_Ad_Hoc_Media_Release_Beijing_8.pdf|title=The CAS Ad Hoc Division Declines to Impose a Provisional Suspension on the Russian Figure Skater Kamila Valieva|publisher=[[Court of Arbitration for Sport]]|date=14 February 2022}}</ref> The IOC announced that the medal ceremony for the team event would not take place until the investigation concluded as there is a concrete decision whether to strip Valieva and the ROC of their medals.

On 15 February, after placing first in the [[Figure skating at the 2022 Winter Olympics ‚Äì Women's singles|women's short program]], Valieva was reported by ''[[The New York Times]]'' to have also tested positive for two other drugs that are not banned from competition, [[hypoxen]] and [[Carnitine|L-carnitine]], from her 25 December urine sample. The combination of these drugs with trimetazidine was described as a "trifecta of substances" which "seem to be aimed at increasing endurance, reducing fatigue and promoting greater efficiency in using oxygen" by [[Travis Tygart]], chief executive of the [[United States Anti-Doping Agency]] (USADA). At the time of the doping test, Valieva had declared taking hypoxen and L-carnitine, both of which are used in Russia supposedly to treat heart conditions or enhance athletic performance.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Ziegler|first1=Martyn|last2=Slot|first2=Owen|date=15 February 2022|title=Kamila Valieva took two legal heart drugs as well as testing positive for a banned substance|language=en|work=The Times|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/kamila-valieva-took-two-legal-heart-drugs-as-well-as-testing-positive-for-a-banned-substance-qmmdgrdhf}}</ref> According to ''The New York Times'', neither agent is backed by scientific evidence of efficacy in improving cardiovascular function in athletes.<ref name="kolata">{{cite news |author1=Gina Kolata |title=Cardiologists question the utility of the drugs found in Valieva's blood |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/15/sports/olympics/cardiologists-drugs-valieva.html |access-date=16 February 2022 |work=The New York Times |date=15 February 2022}}</ref> To allow for the possibility that Valieva's results may be disqualified following investigation, the IOC asked the ISU to expand the qualifying field for the women's singles free skating by one to 25, contingent upon Valieva being one of the top 24 skaters after the short program.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://olympics.com/ioc/news/ioc-eb-decides-no-medal-ceremonies-following-cas-decision-on-the-case-of-roc-skater|title=IOC EB decides no medal ceremonies following CAS decision on the case of ROC skater|publisher=[[International Olympic Committee]]|date=14 February 2022}}</ref>

By 9 March 2022, [[Travis Tygart]] of the [[USADA]] reported that Valieva had not requested that her "B" sample be tested, apparently accepting the results of initial testing and relying on her explanation that the banned substance TMZ belonged to her grandfather and only accidentally contaminated or became mixed into her own use of allowed nutrients and supplements.
