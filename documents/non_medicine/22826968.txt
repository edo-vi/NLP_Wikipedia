The most common and serious vaccine-preventable diseases tracked by the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) are: [[diphtheria]], [[Haemophilus influenzae#Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) infection|''Haemophilus influenzae'' serotype b infection]], [[hepatitis B]], [[measles]], [[meningitis]], [[mumps]], [[pertussis]], [[poliomyelitis]], [[rubella]], [[tetanus]], [[tuberculosis]], and [[yellow fever]].<ref name="Vaccine-preventable diseases">{{cite web |url=https://www.who.int/immunization_monitoring/diseases/en/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050707082527/http://www.who.int/immunization_monitoring/diseases/en/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 7, 2005 |title=WHO &#124; Vaccine-preventable diseases }}</ref> The WHO reports licensed vaccines being available to prevent, or contribute to the prevention and control of, 31 vaccine-preventable infections.<ref name="WHOglobal">{{Cite web |title=Global Vaccine Action Plan |url=https://www.who.int/teams/immunization-vaccines-and-biologicals/strategies/global-vaccine-action-plan |access-date=2023-09-06 |website=www.who.int |language=en}}</ref>

==Background==
In 2012, the [[World Health Organization]] estimated that vaccination prevents 2.5 million deaths each year.<ref name=WHOglobal/> With 100% immunization, and 100% efficacy of the vaccines, one out of seven deaths among young children could be prevented, mostly in developing countries, making this an important [[global health]] issue.<ref name="Vaccine-preventable diseases" /> Four diseases were responsible for 98% of vaccine-preventable deaths: [[measles]], [[Haemophilus influenzae|''Haemophilus influenzae'' serotype b]], [[pertussis]], and neonatal [[tetanus]].<ref name="Vaccine-preventable diseases" />

The Immunization Surveillance, Assessment and Monitoring program of the WHO monitors and assesses the safety and effectiveness of programs and vaccines at reducing [[morbidity|illness]] and [[death]]s from diseases that could be prevented by vaccines.<ref name="urlWHO | Immunization surveillance, assessment and monitoring">{{cite web |url=https://www.who.int/immunization_monitoring/en/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050707020426/http://www.who.int/immunization_monitoring/en/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 7, 2005 |title=Immunization Surveillance, Assessment and Monitoring |access-date=16 May 2009}}</ref>

Vaccine-preventable deaths are usually caused by a failure to obtain the vaccine in a timely manner. This may be due to financial constraints or to lack of access to the vaccine. A vaccine that is generally recommended may be [[contraindicated|medically inappropriate]] for a small number of people due to severe [[allergies]] or [[immunodeficiency|a damaged immune system]]. In addition, a vaccine against a given disease may not be recommended for general use in a given country, or may be recommended only to certain populations, such as young children or older adults. Every country makes its own immunization recommendations, based on the diseases that are common in its area and its healthcare priorities. If a vaccine-preventable disease is uncommon in a country, then residents of that country are unlikely to receive a vaccine against it. For example, residents of Canada and the United States do not routinely receive vaccines against [[yellow fever]], which leaves them vulnerable to infection if travelling to areas where risk of yellow fever is highest (endemic or transitional regions).<ref>{{Cite web |date=2021-03-25 |title=Canadian Immunization Guide: Part 4.
