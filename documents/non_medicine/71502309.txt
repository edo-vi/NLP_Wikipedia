A possibly ongoing '''outbreak of Langya henipavirus''' (LayV) was reported in China in August 2022, with 35 identified cases spanning from 2018 to August 2022.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2022/08/12/china/china-new-virus-disease-animal-spillover-intl-hnk/index.html|title=New Langya virus found in China could be 'tip of the iceberg' for undiscovered pathogens, researchers say|last=McCarthy|first=Simone|publisher=[[CNN]]|date=August 12, 2022|access-date=August 13, 2022}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |date=9 August 2022 |editor-last=Pandey |editor-first=Nikhil |title=What is Langya, the fresh zoonotic virus outbreak that infected 35 people in China? |url=https://www.wionews.com/world/what-is-lagnya-the-fresh-zoonotic-virus-outbreak-that-infected-35-people-in-china-505187 |access-date=2 September 2022 |website=WION}}</ref>  The [[index case]] was a 53-year-old female farmer who had been in contact with shrews and presented with a fever, headache, cough and nausea in [[Qingdao City|Qingdao city]].<ref name=":0" />  The virus was named "Langya" after the hometown of the index patient in [[Shandong]].<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal |last=Mallapaty |first=Smriti |date=25 August 2022 |title=New Animal Virus That Can Infect People Identified in China |url=https://media.nature.com/original/magazine-assets/d41586-022-02175-z/d41586-022-02175-z.pdf |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=608 |issue=7924 |pages=656–7|doi=10.1038/d41586-022-02175-z |pmid=35953571 |s2cid=251517381 }}</ref>

The virus does not appear to spread easily from person to person,<ref name=":1" /> consistent with the 35 reported cases being apparently independent from one another.<ref name=":0" />  In 26 of the 35 human cases reported in China, the only identified infectious agent was LayV; in the LayV-only cases, symptoms appeared such as fever, fatigue, and coughing. No deaths due to LayV had been reported as of August 2022.

LayV infection is a respiratory [[zoonotic disease]] which has been shown to be present in goats and dogs, where [[shrew]]s appear to be a [[viral reservoir]] species.<ref name=":1" />  LayV is closely related to [[Hendra virus]] and [[Nipah virus]], both of which cause respiratory infections that can be fatal, and both of which show low person-to-person transmissibility.<ref name=":1" />  The exact method of transmission between animals and from animal to person remains unknown.<ref name=":1" />  The closest viral strain match to LayV is [[Mojiang henipavirus]] (MojV), discovered in 2012 in rats in southern China and responsible for several fatal respiratory infections.<ref name=":1" />

Initial detection of the virus was made during an infection surveillance study at three hospitals in Eastern China involving patients exhibiting a fever.<ref name=":1" />  The [[Taiwan Centers for Disease Control]] said they would monitor the virus closely and establish a [[genome sequencing]] method to identify the virus.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/aug/10/newly-identified-langya-virus-tracked-after-china-reports-dozens-of-cases|title=Newly identified Langya virus tracked after China reports dozens of cases|last=Lu|first=Donna|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=August 10, 2022|access-date=August 13, 2022}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202208080023|title=CDC to monitor novel virus after China infection reports|last1=Chen|first1=Chieh-ling|last2=Ken|first2=Chao|publisher=[[Focus Taiwan]]|date=August 8, 2022|access-date=August 13, 2022}}</ref>
