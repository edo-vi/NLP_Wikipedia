==Definition==
In ''Double Variation on Enlightenment and National Salvation'', Li Zehou deconstructed [[modern Chinese history]] with the two different themes of [[intellectual history]]: "enlightenment" and "salvation". In the process of modern Chinese history, cultural enlightenment task of "[[Antifeudalism|anti-feudalism]]" was "interrupted" by the theme of national salvation, and the revolutionary and salvation movements not only failed to continue to advance the work of cultural enlightenment, but were also "quietly infiltrated by the old traditional ideology", which eventually caused the [[Cultural Revolution]] to "push Chinese consciousness into the desperate situation of full resurrection of feudal traditions".<ref>{{cite web |title=The "salvation overwhelmed enlightenment" in the cultural context of the 1980s|author=|date=15 September 2008|s2cid=223941600 }}</ref> Briefly, national crises and collective causes eventually submerged the values of [[individual freedom]] advocated by the protagonists of the Enlightenment.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/718b/c2a983ff40854fb608686665ded456529fcf.pdf|title=Ba Jin, "Offspring of May 4th", Time Bomb and Utopian Impulse|author=Zhang Yinde|series=Translating Wor(l)ds |date=19 October 2020|volume=4 |accessdate=|doi=10.30687/978-88-6969-465-3/005 |isbn=978-88-6969-494-3 |s2cid=234425553 }}</ref>

In 1989, Li again clearly pointed out that the direction of modern Chinese history in the twentieth century was that "salvation overwhelmed enlightenment, and the peasant revolution overwhelmed modernization".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wyzxwk.com/Article/zatan/2011/03/210706.html|title=Be wary of the capitalist clamor under the rhetoric of "enlightenment"|author=|date=6 March 2011|accessdate=|work=[[Utopia (internet forum)|Utopia]]}}</ref> He further argued that if salvation overwhelmed enlightenment during the revolutionary era, then today enlightenment is salvation, and the only way to make the country rich and strong and modern is to fight for democracy, [[freedom]], reason, and the [[rule of law]].<ref name="LeeKennedy2017">{{cite book|author1=John Chi-Kin Lee|author2=Kerry J.

According to the Chinese historian [[Qin Hui (historian)|Qin Hui]], "salvation overwhelmed enlightenment" actually means [[nationalism]] overwhelmed liberalism, and helped the rise of [[Marxism]] and [[Leninism]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/ics/21c/media/articles/c150-201506039.pdf|title=Reiterating the Main Tone of the "Great May Fourth" and Why It Was "Overwhelmed"|author=[[Qin Hui (historian)|Qin Hui]]|date=13 August 2015|accessdate=|work=Twenty-First Century}}</ref>
