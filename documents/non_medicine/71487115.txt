The EPC programme found that bicalutamide was effective in treating locally advanced prostate cancer.<ref name="pmid16706554" /> Conversely, it was not effective for localized prostate cancer, where there was instead a [[statistical significance|statistically insignificant]] trend toward reduced [[overall survival]] with bicalutamide therapy (at median 7.4{{nbsp}}years follow-up: {{Abbrlink|HR|hazard ratio}} = 1.16; 95% {{Abbrlink|CI|confidence interval}} = 0.99–1.37; ''{{Abbrlink|P|p-value}}'' = 0.07).<ref name="pmid18366284" /><ref name="pmid16706554" /> The increased [[mortality rate|mortality]] with bicalutamide in men with localized prostate cancer was however statistically significant at certain follow-ups in the Trial 25/SPCG-6 substudy of the EPC programme.<ref name="pmid15540741" /><ref name="pmid25892647" /> The preceding findings led to the withdrawal of pre-existing [[marketing authorisation|approval]] of bicalutamide for localized prostate cancer in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Canada]].<ref name="pmid16706554" />

Liver safety is an important concern with bicalutamide. In the first analysis of the EPC programme at median 3.0{{nbsp}}years of follow-up, abnormal [[liver function test]]s had occurred in 3.4% of men treated with bicalutamide and 1.9% of men with placebo.<ref name="pmid16706554" /><ref name="pmid12603397" /><ref name="pmid12131282" /> Clinically relevant increases in [[aspartate transaminase]] (AST), [[alanine transaminase]] (ALT), and [[bilirubin]] occurred in 1.6%, 1.6%, and 0.7% with bicalutamide and in 0.5%, 0.3%, and 0.4% with placebo.<ref name="pmid16706554" /> However, liver changes with bicalutamide were usually transient and rarely severe.<ref name="pmid16706554" /> Abnormal liver function tests led to treatment withdrawal in 1.4% with bicalutamide and 0.5% with placebo.<ref name="pmid12131282" /> No cases of fatal hepatotoxicity occurred with bicalutamide in the SPCG-6 substudy of the EPC programme.<ref name="pmid15540741" />
