'''Radioactivity''' is generally used in life sciences for highly sensitive and direct measurements of biological phenomena, and for visualizing the location of [[biomolecule]]s [[radiolabelled]] with a [[radioisotope]].

All atoms exist as stable or unstable [[isotope]]s and the latter decay at a given [[half-life]] ranging from attoseconds to billions of years; radioisotopes useful to biological and experimental systems have half-lives ranging from minutes to months.  In the case of the hydrogen isotope [[tritium]] (half-life = 12.3 years) and [[carbon-14]] (half-life = 5,730 years), these isotopes derive their importance from all organic life containing hydrogen and carbon and therefore can be used to study countless living processes, reactions, and phenomena.  Most short lived isotopes are produced in [[cyclotron]]s, linear [[particle accelerator]]s, or [[nuclear reactor]]s and their relatively short half-lives give them high maximum theoretical specific activities which is useful for detection in biological systems.

[[Isotopic labeling|Radiolabeling]] is a technique used to track the passage of a molecule that incorporates a radioisotope through a reaction, metabolic pathway, cell, tissue, organism, or biological system. The reactant is 'labeled' by replacing specific atoms by their isotope.  Replacing an atom with its own radioisotope is an [[Intrinsic and extrinsic properties|intrinsic]] label that does not alter the structure of the molecule.  Alternatively, molecules can be radiolabeled by chemical reactions that introduce an atom, [[Moiety (chemistry)|moiety]], or [[functional group]] that contains a [[radionuclide]].  For example, radio-iodination of peptides and proteins with [[Isotopes of iodine#Radioiodines I-123.2C I-124.2C I-125.2C and I-131 in medicine and biology|biologically useful iodine isotopes]] is easily done by an oxidation reaction that replaces the hydroxyl group with iodine on [[tyrosine]] and [[histadine]] residues.  Another example is to use chelators such [[DOTA (chelator)|DOTA]] that can be chemically coupled to a protein; the chelator in turn traps radiometals thus radiolabeling the protein.  This has been used for introducing Yttrium-90 onto a monoclonal antibody for therapeutic purposes and for introducing Gallium-68 onto the peptide [[Octreotide]] for diagnostic imaging by [[Positron emission tomography|PET imaging]].<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Breeman | first1 = W.

Radiolabeling is not necessary for some applications.  For some purposes,  soluble ionic salts can be used directly without further modification (e.g., [[gallium-67]], [[gallium-68]], and [[radioiodine]] isotopes).  These uses rely on the chemical and biological properties of the radioisotope itself, to localize it within the organism or biological system.

[[Molecular imaging]] is the biomedical field that employs radiotracers to visualize and quantify biological processes using [[positron emission tomography]] (PET) and [[single-photon emission computed tomography]] (SPECT) imaging.  Again, a key feature of using radioactivity in life science applications is that it is a quantitative technique, so PET/SPECT not only reveals where a radiolabelled molecule is but how much is there.

[[Radiobiology]] (also known as radiation biology) is a field of clinical and basic medical sciences that involves the study of the action of radioactivity on biological systems.  The controlled action of deleterious radioactivity on living systems is the basis of [[radiation therapy]].

==Examples of biologically useful radionuclides==
===Hydrogen===
[[Tritium]] (hydrogen-3) is a very low [[Beta decay|beta]] energy emitter that can be used to label [[protein]]s, [[nucleic acid]]s, drugs and almost any organic biomolecule. The maximum theoretical specific activity of tritium is {{convert|28.8|kCi/mol|TBq/mol|abbr=on|lk=on}}.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Voges|first1=Rolf|last2=Heys|first2=J. Richard|last3=Moenius|first3=Thomas|title=Preparation of compounds labeled with tritium and carbon-14|date=2009|publisher=Wiley|location=Chichester, U.K.|isbn=978-0-470-51607-2|page=146|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_VgcIEhrwCIC&pg=PA146|access-date=11 September 2017}}</ref> However, there is often more than one tritium atom per molecule: for example, tritiated [[Uridine triphosphate|UTP]] is sold by most suppliers with carbons 5 and 6 each bonded to a tritium atom.

For tritium detection, liquid [[scintillation counter]]s have been classically employed, in which the energy of a tritium decay is transferred to a [[Scintillator|scintillant]] molecule in solution which in turn gives off photons whose intensity and spectrum can be measured by a [[photomultiplier]] array.  The efficiency of this process is 4–50%, depending on the scintillation cocktail used.

Alternatively, a solid-state, tritium-specific [[Photostimulated luminescence|phosphor screen]] can be used together with a phosphorimager to measure and simultaneously image the radiotracer.<ref>{{cite web|title=Storage Phosphor Screen BAS-IP|url=https://www.gelifesciences.com/gehcls_images/GELS/Related%20Content/Files/1351177681492/litdoc29026296_20161015084341.pdf|website=GE Life Sciences|access-date=11 September 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170911190807/https://www.gelifesciences.com/gehcls_images/GELS/Related%20Content/Files/1351177681492/litdoc29026296_20161015084341.pdf|archive-date=11 September 2017|date=2012|quote=Data file 29-0262-96 AA}}</ref> Measurements/images are digital in nature and can be expressed in intensity or densitometry units within a [[region of interest]] (ROI).

===Carbon===
[[Carbon-14]] has a long half-life of {{val|5730|40|u=years}}. Its maximum specific activity is {{convert|0.0624|kCi/mol|TBq/mol|abbr=on}}. It is used in applications such as [[radiometric dating]] or drug tests.<ref>{{Citation | url=http://www.aptochem.com/t-radiolabeled-test-articles.aspx | title=Radiolabeled Test Articles | publisher=AptoChem }}</ref> Carbon-14 labeling is common in drug development to do [[ADME]] (absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion) studies in animal models and in human toxicology and clinical trials.  Since tritium exchange may occur in some radiolabeled compounds, this does not happen with carbon-14 and may thus be preferred.

===Sodium===
[[Sodium-22]] and [[chlorine-36]] are commonly used to study [[ion transporter]]s. However, sodium-22 is hard to screen off and chlorine-36, with a half-life of 300,000 years, has low activity.<ref>''Biochemic methods. Sample for medicine Students''. 2nd ed 2008, by Birgitte Lüttge. Aarhus University.</ref>

===Sulfur===
[[Sulfur-35]] is used to label proteins and nucleic acids. [[Cysteine]] is an [[amino acid]] containing a [[thiol group]] which can be labeled by sulfur-35. For [[nucleotide]]s that do not contain a sulfur group, the oxygen on one of the phosphate groups can be substituted with a sulfur. This [[thiophosphate]] acts the same as a normal phosphate group, although there is a slight bias against it by most [[polymerase]]s. The maximum theoretical specific activity is {{convert|1494|kCi/mol|PBq/mol|abbr=on}}.

===Phosphorus===
[[Phosphorus-32]] is widely used for labeling nucleic acids and phosphoproteins. It has the highest emission energy (1.7&nbsp;MeV) of all common research radioisotopes. This is a major advantage in experiments for which sensitivity is a primary consideration, such as titrations of very strong interactions (''i.e.'', very low [[dissociation constant]]), footprinting experiments, and detection of low-abundance phosphorylated species. Phosphorus-32 is also relatively inexpensive. Because of its high energy, however, its safe use requires a number of [[engineering controls]] (''e.g.'', [[acrylic glass]]) and [[administrative controls]].  The half-life of phosphorus-32 is 14.2 days, and its maximum specific activity is {{convert|9131|kCi/mol|PBq/mol|abbr=on}}.

[[Phosphorus-33]] is used to label nucleotides. It is less energetic than phosphorus-32 and does not require protection with [[plexiglass]]. A disadvantage is its higher cost compared to phosphorus-32, as most of the bombarded phosphorus-31 will have acquired only one [[neutron]], while only some will have acquired two or more. Its maximum specific activity is {{convert|5118|kCi/mol|PBq/mol|abbr=on}}.

===Iodine===
[[Iodine-125]] is commonly used for labeling proteins, usually at tyrosine residues. Unbound iodine is volatile and must be handled in a fume hood.  Its maximum specific activity is {{convert|2176|kCi/mol|PBq/mol|abbr=on}}.

A good example of the difference in energy of the various radionuclei is the detection window ranges used to detect them, which are generally proportional to the energy of the emission, but vary from machine to machine: in a Perkin elmer TriLux Beta scintillation counter <!-- Googled to see where the hell did the values come from)-->, the hydrogen-3 energy range window is between channel 5–360; carbon-14, sulfur-35 and phosphorus-33 are in the window of 361–660; and phosphorus-32 is in the window of 661–1024.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

== Detection==

[[File:Southern-Blot-Autoradiogramm.jpg|thumb|Autoradiograph of Southern blot membrane]]

===Quantitative===
In [[liquid scintillation counting]], a small aliquot, filter or swab is added to scintillation fluid and the plate or vial is placed in a [[scintillation counter]] to measure the radioactive emissions.  Manufacturers have incorporated solid scintillants into multi-well plates to eliminate the need for scintillation fluid and make this into a high-throughput technique.

A [[gamma counter]] is similar in format to scintillation counting but it detects gamma emissions directly and does not require a scintillant.

A [[Geiger counter]] is a quick and rough approximation of activity. Lower energy emitters such as tritium can not be detected.

===Qualitative AND Quantitative===
[[Autoradiography]]: A tissue section affixed to a microscope slide or a membrane such as a [[Northern blot]] or a hybridized [[slot blot]] can be placed against x-ray film or phosphor screens to acquire a photographic or digital image.  The density of exposure, if calibrated, can supply exacting quantitative information.

[[Phosphor storage screen]]: The slide or membrane is placed against a phosphor screen which is then scanned in a [[phosphorimager]]. This is many times faster than film/emulsion techniques and outputs data in a digital form, thus it has largely replaced film/emulsion techniques.

===Microscopy===
[[Electron microscopy]]: The sample is not exposed to a beam of electrons but detectors picks up the expelled electrons from the radionuclei.

Micro-autoradiography: A tissue section, typically cryosectioned, is placed against a phosphor screen as above.

Quantitative Whole Body Autoradiography (QWBA):  Larger than micro-autoradiography, whole animals, typically rodents, can be analyzed for biodistribution studies.

[[Schild regression]] is a radioligand binding assay. It is used for DNA labelling (5' and 3'), leaving the nucleic acids intact.

==Radioactivity concentration==
A vial of radiolabel has a "total activity". Taking as an example γ32P [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]], from the catalogues of the two major suppliers, Perkin Elmer NEG502H500UC or GE AA0068-500UCI, in this case, the total activity is 500 μCi (other typical numbers are 250 μCi or 1 mCi). This is contained in a certain volume, depending on the radioactive concentration, such as 5 to 10 mCi/mL (185 to 370 TBq/m<sup>3</sup>); typical volumes include 50 or 25 μL.

Not all molecules in the solution have a P-32 on the last (i.e., gamma) phosphate: the "specific activity" gives the radioactivity concentration and depends on the radionuclei's half-life. If every molecule were labelled, the maximum theoretical specific activity is obtained that for P-32 is 9131 Ci/mmol. Due to pre-calibration and efficiency issues this number is never seen on a label; the values often found are 800, 3000 and 6000 Ci/mmol. With this number it is possible to calculate the total chemical concentration and the hot-to-cold ratio.

"Calibration date" is the date in which the vial’s activity is the same as on the label. "Pre-calibration" is when the activity is calibrated in a future date to compensate for the decay occurred during shipping.

==Comparison with fluorescence==
{{See also|Fluorescence in the life sciences}}
Prior to the widespread use of [[Fluorescence in the life sciences|fluorescence]] in the past three decades radioactivity was the most common label.

The primary advantage of fluorescence over radiotracers is that it does not require radiological controls and their associated expenses and safety measures.  The decay of radioisotopes may limit the [[shelf life]] of a reagent, requiring its replacement and thus increasing expenses.  Several fluorescent molecules can be used simultaneously (given that they do not overlap, cf. FRET), whereas with radioactivity two [[isotopes]] can be used ([[tritium]] and a low energy isotope, e.g. [[Phosphorus-33|<sup>33</sup>P]] due to different intensities) but require special equipment (a tritium screen and a regular phosphor-imaging screen, a specific dual channel detector, e.g.  [https://web.archive.org/web/20090105194225/http://www.biospacelab.com/html/microimager.html]).

Fluorescence is not necessary easier or more convenient to use because fluorescence requires specialized equipment of its own and because [[Quenching (fluorescence)|quenching]] makes absolute and/or reproducible quantification difficult.

The primary disadvantage of fluorescence versus radiotracers is a significant biological problem:  chemically tagging a molecule with a fluorescent dye radically changes the structure of the molecule, which in turn can radically change the way that molecule interacts with other molecules.  In contrast, intrinsic radiolabeling of a molecule can be done without altering its structure in any way.  For example, substituting a H-3 for a hydrogen atom or C-14 for a carbon atom does not change the conformation, structure, or any other property of the molecule, it's just switching forms of the same atom.  Thus an intrinsically radiolabeled molecule is identical to its unlabeled counterpart.

Measurement of biological phenomena by radiotracers is always direct.  In contrast, many life science fluorescence applications are indirect, consisting of a fluorescent dye increasing, decreasing, or shifting in wavelength emission upon binding to the molecule of interest.

==Safety==
If good [[health physics]] controls are maintained in a laboratory where radionuclides are used, it is unlikely that the overall radiation dose received by workers will be of much significance. Nevertheless, the effects of low doses are mostly unknown so many regulations exist to avoid unnecessary risks, such as skin or internal exposure. Due to the low penetration power and many variables involved it is hard to convert a radioactive concentration to a dose.
1 μCi of P-32 on a square centimetre of skin (through a dead layer of a thickness of 70 μm) gives 7961 [[Rad (unit)|rads]] (79.61 [[gray (unit)|grays]]) per hour . Similarly a [[mammogram]] gives an exposure of 300 [[Röntgen equivalent man|mrem]] (3 [[millisievert|mSv]]) on a larger volume (in the US, the average annual dose is 620 mrem or 6.2 mSv<ref>{{cite journal|journal=NCRP|volume=160}}</ref> ).
