A '''biological rule''' or '''biological law''' is a generalized [[law (science)|law]], [[principle]], or [[rule of thumb]] formulated to describe patterns observed in living organisms. Biological rules and laws are often developed as succinct, broadly applicable ways to explain complex phenomena or salient observations about the [[ecology]] and [[biogeography|biogeographical]] distributions of plant and animal [[species]] around the world, though they have been proposed for or extended to all types of organisms. Many of these regularities of ecology and biogeography are named after the biologists who first described them.<ref name="Jørgensen2002">{{cite journal |last1=Jørgensen |first1=Sven Erik |title=Explanation of ecological rules and observation by application of ecosystem theory and ecological models|journal=Ecological Modelling |volume=158 |issue=3 |year=2002 |pages=241–248 |doi=10.1016/S0304-3800(02)00236-3}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Allee |first1=W.C. |last2=Schmidt |first2=K.P. |date=1951 |title=Ecological Animal Geography |url=https://archive.org/details/ost-geography-ecologicalanimal030544mbp |edition=2nd |pages=[https://archive.org/details/ost-geography-ecologicalanimal030544mbp/page/n476 457], 460–472|publisher=Joh Wiley & sons }}</ref>

From the birth of their science, biologists have sought to explain apparent regularities in observational data. In [[Aristotle's biology|his biology]], [[Aristotle]] inferred rules governing differences between live-bearing [[tetrapod]]s (in modern terms, terrestrial placental [[mammal]]s). Among his rules were that [[brood size]] decreases with adult body mass, while [[life expectancy|lifespan]] increases with [[gestation period]] and with body mass, and [[fecundity]] decreases with lifespan. Thus, for example, elephants have smaller and fewer broods than mice, but longer lifespan and gestation.<ref>{{cite book |last=Leroi |first=Armand Marie |author-link=Armand Marie Leroi |title=The Lagoon: How Aristotle Invented Science |title-link=Aristotle's Lagoon |publisher=Bloomsbury |date=2014 |isbn=978-1-4088-3622-4 |page=408}}</ref> Rules like these concisely organized the sum of knowledge obtained by early scientific measurements of the natural world, and could be used as [[scientific model|models]] to predict future observations. Among the earliest biological rules in modern times are those of [[Karl Ernst von Baer]] (from 1828 onwards) on [[embryogenesis|embryonic development]],<ref name=Lovtrup/> and of [[Constantin Wilhelm Lambert Gloger]] on animal pigmentation, in 1833.<ref name=Gloger/>
There is some [[scepticism]] among biogeographers about the usefulness of general rules. For example, J.C. Briggs, in his 1987 book ''Biogeography and Plate Tectonics'', comments that while [[Willi Hennig]]'s rules on [[cladistics]] "have generally been helpful", his progression rule is "suspect".<ref name="Briggs1987">{{cite book |last=Briggs |first=J.C. |title=Biogeography and Plate Tectonics |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vCNG2e5K-YgC&pg=PA11 |year=1987 |publisher=Elsevier |isbn=978-0-08-086851-6 |page=11}}</ref>

* '''[[Schmalhausen's law]]''', named after [[Ivan Schmalhausen]], states that a [[population]] at the extreme limit of its tolerance in any one aspect is more vulnerable to small differences in any other aspect. Therefore, the variance of data is not simply noise interfering with the detection of so-called "main effects", but also an indicator of stressful conditions leading to greater vulnerability.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Lewontin, Richard |author1-link=Richard Lewontin |author2=Levins, Richard |title=Schmalhausen's Law |journal=Capitalism, Nature, Socialism |volume=11 |issue=4 |year=2000 |pages=103–108 |doi=10.1080/10455750009358943 |s2cid=144792017 }}</ref>
* '''[[Thorson's rule]]''' states that [[benthic]] [[marine invertebrates]] at low latitudes tend to produce large numbers of eggs developing to [[pelagic]] (often planktotrophic <nowiki>[plankton-feeding]</nowiki>) and widely dispersing larvae, whereas at high latitudes such organisms tend to produce fewer and larger lecithotrophic (yolk-feeding) eggs and larger offspring, often by [[viviparity]] or [[ovoviviparity]], which are often brooded.<ref name="Thorson">Thorson, G. 1957 Bottom communities (sublittoral or shallow shelf).

* '''[[Van Valen's law]]''' states that the probability of [[extinction]] for species and higher taxa (such as families and orders) is constant for each group over time; groups grow neither more resistant nor more vulnerable to extinction, however old their lineage is. It is named for the evolutionary biologist [[Leigh Van Valen]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Leigh Van Valen, evolutionary theorist and paleobiology pioneer, 1935-2010 |url=https://news.uchicago.edu/article/2010/10/19/leigh-van-valen-evolutionary-theorist-and-paleobiology-pioneer-1935-2010 |publisher=University of Chicago |date=20 October 2010}}</ref>
* '''[[von Baer's laws (embryology)|von Baer's laws]]''', discovered by [[Karl Ernst von Baer]], state that [[embryo]]s start from a common form and develop into increasingly specialised forms, so that the diversification of embryonic form mirrors the [[tree of life (biology)|taxonomic and phylogenetic tree]]. Therefore, all animals in a phylum share a similar early embryo; animals in smaller taxa (classes, orders, families, genera, species) share later and later embryonic stages. This was in sharp contrast to the [[recapitulation theory]] of [[Johann Friedrich Meckel]] (and later of [[Ernst Haeckel]]), which claimed that embryos went through stages resembling adult organisms from successive stages of the ''[[scala naturae]]'' from supposedly lowest to highest levels of organisation.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Opitz |first1=John M. |last2=Schultka |first2=Rüdiger |last3=Göbbel |first3=Luminita |title=Meckel on developmental pathology |journal=American Journal of Medical Genetics Part A |date=2006 |volume=140A |issue=2 |pages=115–128 |doi=10.1002/ajmg.a.31043 |pmid=16353245|s2cid=30513424 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Garstang |first1=Walter |author-link=Walter Garstang |title=The Theory of Recapitulation: A Critical Re-statement of the Biogenetic Law |journal=Journal of the Linnean Society of London, Zoology |date=1922 |volume=35 |issue=232 |pages=81–101 |doi=10.1111/j.1096-3642.1922.tb00464.x}}</ref><ref name=Lovtrup>{{cite journal |last1=Lovtrup |first1=Soren |title=On von Baerian and Haeckelian Recapitulation |journal=Systematic Zoology |date=1978 |volume=27 |issue=3 |pages=348–352 |doi=10.2307/2412887 |jstor=2412887 }}</ref>
* '''[[Williston's law]]''', first noticed by [[Samuel Wendell Williston]], states that parts in an organism tend to become reduced in number and greatly specialized in function. He had studied the dentition of vertebrates, and noted that where ancient animals had mouths with differing kinds of teeth, modern carnivores had incisors and canines specialized for tearing and cutting flesh, while modern herbivores had large molars specialized for grinding tough plant materials.<ref>{{cite book |last=Williston |first=Samuel Wendall |author-link=Samuel Wendell Williston |title=Water Reptiles of the Past and Present |url=https://archive.org/details/waterreptilesofp00will |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |year=1914}}</ref>
