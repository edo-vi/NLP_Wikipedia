'''Ann Boyce''' (20 November 1827 – 28 February 1914) was a New Zealand founding mother and herbalist. She was born Ann Cave in Sydney, Australia, on 20 November 1827. In 1837 she came to [[Port Underwood]] in Marlborough, New Zealand, with her family. She married William Boyce when she was 16 or less, and they lived in the Nelson area, and later [[Motueka]].

Boyce had close contact with [[Māori people]] from the time she came to New Zealand. In Motueka, she was known as a herbalist especially knowledgeable about the medicinal use of plants, and provided medical assistance to Māori.<ref name="DNZB Boyce" />

She died at Motueka on 28 February 1914 aged 87, having outlived her husband by nearly 19 years.<ref name="DNZB Boyce" /><ref name=Obituary />

She was written about in a two-page story by her granddaughter [[Flora Park Cave Spurdle]] called "Tales my grandmother told me".<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |url= http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/biographies/1b28/sources |title=Boyce, Ann |encyclopedia=Te Ara Encyclopedia of New Zealand |first= Katherine W. |last=Orr. |date=12 October 2010 |access-date=11 September 2012}}</ref>

Boyce's parents were Samuel Cave and [[Susannah Noon]], both sent to New South Wales from England as convicts. Noon was only a young girl when she was transported in 1811. An account of her life and those of the other women on the convict ship [[Friends (1799 ship)|''Friends'']], ''The Girl Who Stole Stockings'', was published in October 2015.<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Girl Who Stole Stockings|last = Hardie|first = Elsbeth|publisher = Australian Teachers of Media Inc.
