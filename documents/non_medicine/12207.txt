It is integrated with [[Earth system science]] and [[planetary science]].

Geology describes the [[structure of the Earth]] on and beneath its surface and the processes that have shaped that structure. Geologists study the mineralogical composition of rocks in order to get insight into their history of formation. Geology determines the [[Relative dating|relative ages]] of rocks found at a given location; [[geochemistry]] (a branch of geology) determines their [[Geochronology|absolute ages]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Gunten|first1=Hans R. von|title=Radioactivity: A Tool to Explore the Past|journal=Radiochimica Acta|volume=70–71|issue=s1|year=1995|pages=305–413|issn=2193-3405|doi=10.1524/ract.1995.7071.special-issue.305|s2cid=100441969|url=http://doc.rero.ch/record/292801/files/ract.1995.7071.special-issue.305.pdf|access-date=2019-06-29|archive-date=2019-12-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191212005652/http://doc.rero.ch/record/292801/files/ract.1995.7071.special-issue.305.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref> By combining various petrological, crystallographic, and paleontological tools, [[geologist]]s are able to chronicle the geological [[history of the Earth]] as a whole. One aspect is to demonstrate the [[age of the Earth]]. Geology provides evidence for [[plate tectonics]], the [[evolutionary history of life]], and the Earth's [[paleoclimatology|past climates]].

[[Geologist]]s broadly study the properties and processes of Earth and other terrestrial planets. Geologists use a wide variety of methods to understand the Earth's structure and evolution, including [[field work|fieldwork]], [[Petrology|rock description]], [[Geophysical survey|geophysical techniques]], [[Geochemistry|chemical analysis]], [[physical experiment]]s, and [[Computer simulation|numerical modelling]]. In practical terms, geology is important for [[mining|mineral]] and [[petroleum geology|hydrocarbon]] exploration and exploitation, evaluating [[water resources]], understanding [[natural hazard]]s, remediating [[Environmental Geology|environmental]] problems, and providing insights into past [[Climate variability and change|climate change]]. Geology is a major [[academic discipline]], and it is central to [[geological engineering]] and plays an important role in [[geotechnical engineering]].

==Geological material==
The majority of geological data comes from research on solid Earth materials. Meteorites and other extraterrestrial natural materials are also studied by geological methods.

===Mineral===
{{main|Mineral}}
Minerals are naturally occurring [[Chemical element|element]]s and [[Chemical compound|compound]]s with a definite homogeneous chemical composition and ordered atomic composition.

Each mineral has distinct physical properties, and there are many tests to determine each of them. Minerals are often identified through these tests. The specimens can be tested for:<ref>{{cite web|title=Mineral Identification Tests|url=http://jersey.uoregon.edu/~mstrick/MinRockID/MinTests.html|website=Geoman's Mineral ID Tests|access-date=17 April 2017|archive-date=9 May 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170509215641/http://jersey.uoregon.edu/~mstrick/MinRockID/MinTests.html|url-status=live}}</ref>
* [[Lustre (mineralogy)|Luster]]: Quality of light reflected from the surface of a mineral. Examples are metallic, pearly, waxy, dull.
* Color: Minerals are grouped by their color. Mostly diagnostic but impurities can change a mineral's color.
* [[Streak (mineralogy)|Streak]]: Performed by scratching the sample on a [[porcelain]] plate. The color of the streak can help name the mineral.
* Hardness: The resistance of a mineral to scratching.
* Breakage pattern: A mineral can either show fracture or [[Cleavage (crystal)|cleavage]], the former being breakage of uneven surfaces, and the latter a breakage along closely spaced parallel planes.
* [[Relative density|Specific gravity]]: the weight of a specific volume of a mineral.
* Effervescence: Involves dripping [[hydrochloric acid]] on the mineral to test for fizzing.
* Magnetism: Involves using a magnet to test for [[magnetism]].
* Taste: Minerals can have a distinctive taste such as [[Halite (mineral)|halite]] (which tastes like [[table salt]]).

===Rock===
[[File:Rockcycle edit.jpg|thumb|The [[rock cycle]] shows the relationship between [[igneous]], [[sedimentary]], and [[metamorphic]] [[rock (geology)|rock]]s.]]

{{Main|Rock (geology)|Rock cycle}}

A rock is any naturally occurring solid mass or aggregate of minerals or [[mineraloid]]s. Most research in geology is associated with the study of rocks, as they provide the primary record of the majority of the geological history of the Earth. There are three major types of rock: [[igneous]], [[sedimentary]], and [[metamorphic]]. The [[rock cycle]]
illustrates the relationships among them (see diagram).

When a rock [[solidifies]] or [[crystallization|crystallizes]] from melt ([[magma]] or [[lava]]), it is an [[igneous rock]]. This rock can be [[weathering|weathered]] and [[eroded]], then [[deposition (geology)|redeposited]] and [[lithification|lithified]] into a sedimentary rock. It can then be turned into a [[metamorphic rock]] by heat and pressure that change its [[mineral]] content, resulting in a [[fabric (geology)|characteristic fabric]]. All three types may melt again, and when this happens, new magma is formed, from which an igneous rock may once again solidify.
Organic matter, such as coal, bitumen, oil, and natural gas, is linked mainly to organic-rich sedimentary rocks.

[[File:Quartz, Tibet.jpg|thumb|[[Quartz]] from [[Tibet]]. Quartz makes up more than 10% of the Earth's crust by mass.]]

To study all three types of rock, geologists evaluate the minerals of which they are composed and their other physical properties, such as [[Texture (geology)|texture]] and [[Fabric (geology)|fabric]].

===Unlithified material===
Geologists also study unlithified materials (referred to as ''[[superficial deposits]]'') that lie above the [[bedrock]].<ref>[http://des.nh.gov/organization/commissioner/gsu/gmp/categories/overview.htm "Surficial Geologic Maps"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160216095807/http://des.nh.gov/organization/commissioner/gsu/gmp/categories/overview.htm |date=2016-02-16 }} in New Hampshire Geological Survey, Geologic maps. des.nh.gov</ref> This study is often known as [[Quaternary geology]], after the [[Quaternary period]] of geologic history, which is the most recent period of geologic time.

====Magma====
{{main|Magma}}

[[Magma]] is the original unlithified source of all [[igneous rocks]]. The active flow of molten rock is closely studied in [[volcanology]], and [[igneous petrology]] aims to determine the history of [[igneous rock]]s from their original molten source to their final crystallization.

==Whole-Earth structure==

===Plate tectonics===
{{Main|Plate tectonics}}
[[File:Active Margin.svg|thumb|left|Oceanic-continental convergence resulting in [[subduction]] and [[volcanic arc]]s illustrates one effect of [[plate tectonics]].]]
[[File:Plates tect2 en.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|The major [[tectonic plates]] of the [[Earth]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ocre-geoscience.com/ocre-geomap/|title=OCRE GeoMap|website=OCRE Geoscience Services}}</ref>]]

In the 1960s, it was discovered that the Earth's [[lithosphere]], which includes the [[Crust (geology)|crust]] and rigid uppermost portion of the [[upper mantle]], is separated into [[tectonic plate]]s that move across the [[Plasticity (physics)|plastically]] deforming, solid, upper mantle, which is called the [[asthenosphere]]. This theory is supported by several types of observations, including seafloor spreading<ref>Hess, H.H. (November 1, 1962) "[http://repositories.cdlib.org/sio/lib/23 History Of Ocean Basins] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091016025000/http://repositories.cdlib.org/sio/lib/23 |date=2009-10-16 }}", pp. 599–620 in ''Petrologic studies: a volume in honor of A.F. Buddington''. A.E.J. Engel, Harold L. James, and B.F. Leonard (eds.).

There is an intimate coupling between the movement of the plates on the surface and the [[mantle convection|convection of the mantle]] (that is, the [[heat]] transfer caused by the slow movement of ductile mantle rock). Thus, oceanic plates and the adjoining mantle [[Convection|convection currents]] always move in the same direction – because the oceanic lithosphere is actually the rigid upper thermal [[boundary layer]] of the convecting mantle. This coupling between rigid plates moving on the surface of the Earth and the convecting [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] is called plate [[tectonics]].

[[File:Farallon Plate.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|In this diagram based on [[seismic tomography]], subducting [[Slab (geology)|slabs]] are in blue and continental margins and a few plate boundaries are in red. The blue blob in the cutaway section is the [[Farallon Plate]], which is subducting beneath North America. The remnants of this plate on the surface of the Earth are the [[Juan de Fuca Plate]] and [[Explorer Plate]], both in the northwestern United States and southwestern Canada and the [[Cocos Plate]] on the west coast of Mexico.]]

The development of plate tectonics has provided a physical basis for many observations of the solid [[Earth]]. Long linear regions of geological features are explained as plate boundaries.<ref name="TDE plates">{{Cite book |last1=Kious |first1=Jacquelyne |author2=Tilling, Robert I. |others=Kiger, Martha, Russel, Jane |title=This Dynamic Earth: The Story of Plate Tectonics |publisher=United States Geological Survey |location=Reston, VA |date=1996 |edition=Online |chapter=Understanding Plate Motions |isbn=978-0-16-048220-5 |chapter-url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/dynamic/understanding.html |access-date=13 March 2009 |archive-date=10 August 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810162308/http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/dynamic/understanding.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

For example:
* [[Mid-ocean ridge]]s, high regions on the seafloor where [[hydrothermal vent]]s and volcanoes exist, are seen as [[divergent boundary|divergent boundaries]], where two plates move apart.
* Arcs of volcanoes and earthquakes are theorized as [[convergent boundary|convergent boundaries]], where one plate [[subduction|subducts]], or moves, under another.

[[Transform boundary|Transform boundaries]], such as the [[San Andreas Fault]] system, resulted in widespread powerful earthquakes. Plate tectonics also has provided a mechanism for [[Alfred Wegener]]'s theory of [[continental drift]],<ref>{{Cite book |author=Wegener, A. |url=https://archive.org/details/originsofcontine0000unse |title=Origin of continents and oceans |publisher=Courier Corporation |year=1999 |isbn=978-0-486-61708-4 |url-access=registration}}</ref> in which the [[continents]] move across the surface of the Earth over geological time. They also provided a driving force for crustal deformation, and a new setting for the observations of structural geology. The power of the theory of plate tectonics lies in its ability to combine all of these observations into a single theory of how the lithosphere moves over the convecting mantle.

===Earth structure===
{{Main|Structure of the Earth}}
[[File:Jordens inre-numbers.svg|thumb|left|The [[Earth]]'s layered structure. (1) inner core; (2) outer core; (3) lower mantle; (4) upper mantle; (5) lithosphere; (6) crust (part of the lithosphere)]]
[[File:Earthquake wave paths.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|Earth layered structure. Typical wave paths from earthquakes like these gave early seismologists insights into the layered structure of the Earth]]

Advances in [[seismology]], [[computer modeling]], and [[mineralogy]] and [[crystallography]] at high temperatures and pressures give insights into the internal composition and structure of the Earth.

Seismologists can use the arrival times of [[seismic wave]]s to image the interior of the Earth. Early advances in this field showed the existence of a liquid [[Earth's outer core|outer core]] (where [[S-wave|shear waves]] were not able to propagate) and a dense solid [[Earth's inner core|inner core]]. These advances led to the development of a layered model of the Earth, with a [[crust (geology)|crust]] and [[lithosphere]] on top, the [[mantle (geology)|mantle]] below (separated within itself by [[seismic tomography|seismic discontinuities]] at 410 and 660 kilometers), and the outer core and inner core below that. More recently, seismologists have been able to create detailed images of wave speeds inside the earth in the same way a doctor images a body in a [[CT scan]]. These images have led to a much more detailed view of the interior of the Earth, and have replaced the simplified layered model with a much more dynamic model.

Mineralogists have been able to use the pressure and temperature data from the seismic and modeling studies alongside knowledge of the elemental composition of the Earth to reproduce these conditions in experimental settings and measure changes within the crystal structure. These studies explain the chemical changes associated with the major seismic discontinuities in the mantle and show the crystallographic structures expected in the inner core of the Earth.

==Dating methods==

===Relative dating===
{{Main|Relative dating}}
[[File:Cross-cutting relations.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|[[Cross-cutting relations]] can be used to determine the relative ages of [[stratum|rock strata]] and other geological structures. Explanations: A – [[fold (geology)|folded]] rock strata cut by a [[thrust fault]]; B – large [[intrusion]] (cutting through A); C – [[erosion]]al [[angular unconformity]] (cutting off A & B) on which rock strata were deposited; D – [[dike (geology)|volcanic dyke]] (cutting through A, B & C); E – even younger rock strata (overlying C & D); F – [[normal fault]] (cutting through A, B, C & E).]]

Methods for [[relative dating]] were developed when geology first emerged as a [[natural science]]. Geologists still use the following principles today as a means to provide information about geological history and the timing of geological events.

The ''[[principle of uniformitarianism]]'' states that the geological processes observed in operation that modify the Earth's crust at present have worked in much the same way over geological time.<ref>Reijer Hooykaas, [https://books.google.com/books?id=3TgYAAAAIAAJ ''Natural Law and Divine Miracle: The Principle of Uniformity in Geology, Biology, and Theology''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170119224821/https://books.google.com/books?id=3TgYAAAAIAAJ&pgis=1 |date=2017-01-19 }}, Leiden: [[EJ Brill]], 1963.</ref> A fundamental principle of geology advanced by the 18th-century Scottish physician and geologist [[James Hutton]] is that "the present is the key to the past." In Hutton's words: "the past history of our globe must be explained by what can be seen to be happening now."<ref>{{cite book|last1=Levin|first1=Harold L.|title=The earth through time|year=2010|publisher=J. Wiley|location=Hoboken, NJ|isbn=978-0-470-38774-0|edition=9th|page=18}}</ref>

The ''[[Intrusion (geology)|principle of intrusive relationships]]'' concerns crosscutting intrusions. In geology, when an [[igneous rocks|igneous]] intrusion cuts across a formation of [[sedimentary rock]], it can be determined that the igneous intrusion is younger than the sedimentary rock. Different types of intrusions include stocks, [[laccolith]]s, [[batholith]]s, [[Sill (geology)|sills]] and [[Dike (geology)|dikes]].

The ''[[principle of cross-cutting relationships]]'' pertains to the formation of [[Fault (geology)|faults]] and the age of the sequences through which they cut. Faults are younger than the rocks they cut; accordingly, if a fault is found that penetrates some formations but not those on top of it, then the formations that were cut are older than the fault, and the ones that are not cut must be younger than the fault. Finding the key bed in these situations may help determine whether the fault is a [[normal fault]] or a [[thrust fault]].<ref name="steno strat">{{cite web |url=http://rainbow.ldeo.columbia.edu/courses/v1001/steno.html |title=Steno's Principles of Stratigraphy |last1=Olsen |first1=Paul E. |year=2001 |work=Dinosaurs and the History of Life |publisher=Columbia University |access-date=2009-03-14 |archive-date=2008-05-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509122724/http://rainbow.ldeo.columbia.edu/courses/v1001/steno.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

The ''[[principle of inclusions and components]]'' states that, with sedimentary rocks, if inclusions (or ''[[Clastic rocks|clasts]]'') are found in a formation, then the inclusions must be older than the formation that contains them. For example, in sedimentary rocks, it is common for gravel from an older formation to be ripped up and included in a newer layer. A similar situation with igneous rocks occurs when [[xenolith]]s are found. These foreign bodies are picked up as [[magma]] or lava flows, and are incorporated, later to cool in the matrix. As a result, xenoliths are older than the rock that contains them.

[[File:SEUtahStrat.JPG|thumb|upright=1.35|The [[Permian]] through [[Jurassic]] stratigraphy of the [[Colorado Plateau]] area of southeastern [[Utah]] is an example of both original horizontality and the law of superposition. These strata make up much of the famous prominent rock formations in widely spaced protected areas such as [[Capitol Reef National Park]] and [[Canyonlands National Park]]. From top to bottom: Rounded tan domes of the [[Navajo Sandstone]], layered red [[Kayenta Formation]], cliff-forming, vertically jointed, red [[Wingate Sandstone]], slope-forming, purplish [[Chinle Formation]], layered, lighter-red [[Moenkopi Formation]], and white, layered [[Cutler Formation]] sandstone. Picture from [[Glen Canyon National Recreation Area]], Utah.]]
The ''[[principle of original horizontality]]'' states that the deposition of sediments occurs as essentially horizontal beds. Observation of modern marine and non-marine sediments in a wide variety of environments supports this generalization (although [[cross-bedding]] is inclined, the overall orientation of cross-bedded units is horizontal).<ref name="steno strat" />

The ''[[Law of superposition|principle of superposition]]'' states that a sedimentary rock layer in a [[tectonics|tectonically]] undisturbed sequence is younger than the one beneath it and older than the one above it. Logically a younger layer cannot slip beneath a layer previously deposited. This principle allows sedimentary layers to be viewed as a form of the vertical timeline, a partial or complete record of the time elapsed from deposition of the lowest layer to deposition of the highest bed.<ref name="steno strat" />

The ''[[principle of faunal succession]]'' is based on the appearance of fossils in sedimentary rocks. As organisms exist during the same period throughout the world, their presence or (sometimes) absence provides a relative age of the formations where they appear. Based on principles that William Smith laid out almost a hundred years before the publication of [[Charles Darwin]]'s theory of [[evolution]], the principles of succession developed independently of evolutionary thought. The principle becomes quite complex, however, given the uncertainties of fossilization, localization of fossil types due to lateral changes in habitat ([[facies]] change in sedimentary strata), and that not all fossils formed globally at the same time.<ref>As recounted in [[Simon Winchester]], ''[[The Map that Changed the World]]'' (New York: HarperCollins, 2001) pp. 59–91.</ref>

===Absolute dating===
{{Main|Absolute dating|radiometric dating|geochronology}}
[[File:Zircon-tuc1001b.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[mineral]] [[zircon]] is often used in [[radiometric dating]].]]

Geologists also use methods to determine the absolute age of rock samples and geological events. These dates are useful on their own and may also be used in conjunction with relative dating methods or to calibrate relative methods.<ref>{{Cite journal| first1 = R.D.| last1 = Tucker| first2 = D.C.| first3 = C.A.| first4 = A.G.| first5 = J.R.| first6 = S.R.| title = New U–Pb zircon ages and the duration and division of Devonian time| journal = Earth and Planetary Science Letters| volume = 158| issue = 3–4| pages = 175–186| year = 1998| doi = 10.1016/S0012-821X(98)00050-8| last2 = Bradley| last3 = Ver Straeten| last4 = Harris| last5 = Ebert| last6 = McCutcheon| bibcode = 1998E&PSL.158..175T|url=https://alaska.usgs.gov/staff/geology/bradley/bradley_pubs/Tucker_Dev_time_scale_1998.pdf| citeseerx = 10.1.1.498.7372| access-date = 2018-01-29| archive-date = 2016-12-26| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161226203632/https://alaska.usgs.gov/staff/geology/bradley/bradley_pubs/Tucker_Dev_time_scale_1998.pdf| url-status = dead}}</ref>

At the beginning of the 20th century, advancement in geological science was facilitated by the ability to obtain accurate absolute dates to geological events using [[radioactive isotope]]s and other methods. This changed the understanding of geological time. Previously, geologists could only use fossils and stratigraphic correlation to date sections of rock relative to one another. With isotopic dates, it became possible to assign [[Absolute dating|absolute ages]] to rock units, and these absolute dates could be applied to fossil sequences in which there was datable material, converting the old relative ages into new absolute ages.

For many geological applications, [[isotope ratio]]s of radioactive elements are measured in minerals that give the amount of time that has passed since a rock passed through its particular [[closure temperature]], the point at which different radiometric isotopes stop diffusing into and out of the [[Crystal structure|crystal lattice]].<ref>{{Cite book |isbn=978-0-582-06701-1 |author=Rollinson, Hugh R.  |year=1996 |publisher=Longman |location=Harlow |title=Using geochemical data evaluation, presentation, interpretation}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |isbn=978-0-02-336450-1 |author=Faure, Gunter |year=1998 |publisher=Prentice-Hall |location=Upper Saddle River, NJ |title=Principles and applications of geochemistry: a comprehensive textbook for geology students}}</ref> These are used in [[geochronology|geochronologic]] and [[thermochronology|thermochronologic]] studies. Common methods include [[uranium–lead dating]], [[K–Ar dating|potassium–argon dating]], [[argon–argon dating]] and [[uranium–thorium dating]]. These methods are used for a variety of applications. Dating of [[lava]] and [[volcanic ash]] layers found within a stratigraphic sequence can provide absolute age data for sedimentary rock units that do not contain radioactive isotopes and calibrate relative dating techniques. These methods can also be used to determine ages of [[pluton]] emplacement.
Thermochemical techniques can be used to determine temperature profiles within the crust, the uplift of mountain ranges, and paleo-topography.

Fractionation of the [[lanthanide series]] elements is used to compute ages since rocks were removed from the mantle.

Other methods are used for more recent events. [[Optically stimulated luminescence]] and [[Cosmogenic isotope#Natural|cosmogenic radionuclide]] dating are used to date surfaces and/or erosion rates. [[Dendrochronology]] can also be used for the dating of landscapes. [[Radiocarbon dating]] is used for geologically young materials containing [[Organic matter|organic carbon]].

Rock units are first emplaced either by deposition onto the surface or intrusion into the [[Country rock (geology)|overlying rock]]. Deposition can occur when sediments settle onto the surface of the Earth and later [[lithification|lithify]] into sedimentary rock, or when as [[volcanic rock|volcanic material]] such as [[volcanic ash]] or [[lava flow]]s blanket the surface. [[Igneous intrusion]]s such as [[batholith]]s, [[laccolith]]s, [[dike (geology)|dikes]], and [[sill (geology)|sills]], push upwards into the overlying rock, and crystallize as they intrude.

After the initial sequence of rocks has been deposited, the rock units can be [[deformation (mechanics)|deformed]] and/or [[metamorphism|metamorphosed]]. Deformation typically occurs as a result of horizontal shortening, [[extension (geology)|horizontal extension]], or side-to-side ([[strike-slip]]) motion. These structural regimes broadly relate to [[convergent boundary|convergent boundaries]], [[divergent boundary|divergent boundaries]], and transform boundaries, respectively, between tectonic plates.

When rock units are placed under horizontal [[compression (geology)|compression]], they shorten and become thicker. Because rock units, other than muds, [[Incompressible surface|do not significantly change in volume]], this is accomplished in two primary ways: through [[fault (geology)|faulting]] and [[fold (geology)|folding]]. In the shallow crust, where [[brittle deformation]] can occur, thrust faults form, which causes the deeper rock to move on top of the shallower rock. Because deeper rock is often older, as noted by the [[law of superposition|principle of superposition]], this can result in older rocks moving on top of younger ones. Movement along faults can result in folding, either because the faults are not planar or because rock layers are dragged along, forming drag folds as slip occurs along the fault. Deeper in the Earth, rocks behave plastically and fold instead of faulting. These folds can either be those where the material in the center of the fold buckles upwards, creating "[[antiform]]s", or where it buckles downwards, creating "[[synform]]s". If the tops of the rock units within the folds remain pointing upwards, they are called [[anticline]]s and [[syncline]]s, respectively. If some of the units in the fold are facing downward, the structure is called an overturned anticline or syncline, and if all of the rock units are overturned or the correct up-direction is unknown, they are simply called by the most general terms, antiforms, and synforms.

[[File:Antecline (PSF).png|thumb|A diagram of folds, indicating an [[anticline]] and a [[syncline]]]]
Even higher pressures and temperatures during horizontal shortening can cause both folding and [[metamorphism]] of the rocks. This metamorphism causes changes in the [[mineral|mineral composition]] of the rocks; creates a [[foliation (geology)|foliation]], or planar surface, that is related to mineral growth under stress. This can remove signs of the original textures of the rocks, such as [[bed (geology)|bedding]] in sedimentary rocks, flow features of [[lava]]s, and crystal patterns in [[crystalline rock]]s.

Extension causes the rock units as a whole to become longer and thinner. This is primarily accomplished through [[normal fault]]ing and through the ductile stretching and thinning. Normal faults drop rock units that are higher below those that are lower. This typically results in younger units ending up below older units. Stretching of units can result in their thinning. In fact, at one location within the [[Maria Fold and Thrust Belt]], the entire sedimentary sequence of the [[Grand Canyon]] appears over a length of less than a meter. Rocks at the depth to be ductilely stretched are often also metamorphosed. These stretched rocks can also pinch into lenses, known as ''[[boudinage|boudins]]'', after the French word for "sausage" because of their visual similarity.

Where rock units slide past one another, [[strike-slip fault]]s develop in shallow regions, and become [[shear zone]]s at deeper depths where the rocks deform ductilely.

[[File:Kittatinny Mountain Cross Section.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Geological [[cross section (geology)|cross section]] of [[Kittatinny Mountain]]. This cross-section shows metamorphic rocks, overlain by younger sediments deposited after the metamorphic event. These rock units were later folded and faulted during the uplift of the mountain.]]
The addition of new rock units, both depositionally and intrusively, often occurs during deformation. Faulting and other deformational processes result in the creation of topographic gradients, causing material on the rock unit that is increasing in elevation to be eroded by hillslopes and channels. These sediments are deposited on the rock unit that is going down. Continual motion along the fault maintains the topographic gradient in spite of the movement of sediment and continues to create [[accommodation space]] for the material to deposit. Deformational events are often also associated with volcanism and igneous activity. Volcanic ashes and lavas accumulate on the surface, and igneous intrusions enter from below. [[Dike (geology)|Dikes]], long, planar igneous intrusions, enter along cracks, and therefore often form in large numbers in areas that are being actively deformed. This can result in the emplacement of [[dike swarm]]s, such as those that are observable across the Canadian shield, or rings of dikes around the [[lava tube]] of a volcano.

All of these processes do not necessarily occur in a single environment and do not necessarily occur in a single order. The [[Hawaiian Islands]], for example, consist almost entirely of layered [[basalt]]ic lava flows. The sedimentary sequences of the mid-continental United States and the [[Geology of the Grand Canyon area|Grand Canyon]] in the southwestern United States contain almost-undeformed stacks of sedimentary rocks that have remained in place since [[Cambrian]] time. Other areas are much more geologically complex. In the southwestern United States, sedimentary, volcanic, and intrusive rocks have been metamorphosed, faulted, foliated, and folded. Even older rocks, such as the [[Acasta gneiss]] of the [[Slave craton]] in northwestern [[Canada]], the [[Oldest rock|oldest known rock in the world]] have been metamorphosed to the point where their origin is indiscernible without laboratory analysis. In addition, these processes can occur in stages. In many places, the Grand Canyon in the southwestern United States being a very visible example, the lower rock units were metamorphosed and deformed, and then deformation ended and the upper, undeformed units were deposited. Although any amount of rock emplacement and rock deformation can occur, and they can occur any number of times, these concepts provide a guide to understanding the [[Historical geology|geological history]] of an area.

==Methods of geology==
[[File:Brunton.JPG|thumb|A standard [[:en:Brunton compass|Brunton Pocket Transit]], commonly used by geologists for mapping and surveying]]

Geologists use a number of fields, laboratory, and numerical modeling methods to decipher Earth history and to understand the processes that occur on and inside the Earth. In typical geological investigations, geologists use primary information related to [[petrology]] (the study of rocks), stratigraphy (the study of sedimentary layers), and structural geology (the study of positions of rock units and their deformation). In many cases, geologists also study modern soils, [[river]]s, [[landscape]]s, and [[glacier]]s; investigate past and current life and [[biogeochemistry|biogeochemical]] pathways, and use [[geophysics|geophysical methods]] to investigate the subsurface. Sub-specialities of geology may distinguish '''endogenous''' and '''exogenous''' geology.<ref>Compare: {{cite book

===Petrology===
{{Main|Petrology}}

In addition to identifying rocks in the field ([[lithology]]), petrologists identify rock samples in the laboratory. Two of the primary methods for identifying rocks in the laboratory are through [[optical microscopy]] and by using an [[electron microprobe]]. In an [[optical mineralogy]] analysis, petrologists analyze [[thin section]]s of rock samples using a [[petrographic microscope]], where the minerals can be identified through their different properties in plane-polarized and cross-polarized light, including their [[birefringence]], [[pleochroism]], [[Crystal twinning|twinning]], and interference properties with a [[Conoscopy|conoscopic lens]].<ref>{{Cite book |isbn= 978-0-19-506024-9 |author= Nesse, William D. |year= 1991 |publisher= Oxford University Press |location= New York |title= Introduction to optical mineralogy}}</ref> In the electron microprobe, individual locations are analyzed for their exact chemical compositions and variation in composition within individual crystals.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi= 10.1111/j.1365-3091.1985.tb00470.x |title= A new approach to provenance studies: electron microprobe analysis of detrital garnets from Middle Jurassic sandstones of the northern North Sea |year= 1985 |author= Morton, A.C. |journal= Sedimentology |volume= 32 |pages= 553–566 |issue= 4|bibcode = 1985Sedim..32..553M }}</ref> [[Stable isotope|Stable]]<ref>{{Cite journal |doi= 10.1016/S0012-8252(02)00133-2 |title= Stable isotope geochemistry of ultrahigh pressure metamorphic rocks from the Dabie–Sulu orogen in China: implications for geodynamics and fluid regime |year= 2003 |author= Zheng, Y |journal= Earth-Science Reviews |volume= 62 |issue= 1 |pages= 105–161 |bibcode= 2003ESRv...62..105Z |last2= Fu |first2= Bin |last3= Gong |first3= Bing |last4= Li |first4= Long}}</ref> and [[radioactive isotope]]<ref>{{Cite journal |doi= 10.1016/0012-821X(95)00052-E |title= Magma dynamics at Mt Etna: Constraints from U-Th-Ra-Pb radioactive disequilibria and Sr isotopes in historical lavas |year= 1995 |author= Condomines, M |journal= Earth and Planetary Science Letters |volume= 132 |issue= 1 |pages= 25–41 |last2= Tanguy |first2= J |last3= Michaud |first3= V |bibcode=1995E&PSL.132...25C}}</ref> studies provide insight into the [[Geochemistry|geochemical]] evolution of rock units.

===Structural geology===
{{Main|Structural geology}}
[[File:Orogenic wedge.jpg|thumb|upright=1.8|A diagram of an orogenic wedge. The wedge grows through faulting in the interior and along the main basal fault, called the [[Decollement|décollement]]. It builds its shape into a [[critical taper]], in which the angles within the wedge remain the same as failures inside the material balance failures along the décollement. It is analogous to a bulldozer pushing a pile of dirt, where the bulldozer is the overriding plate.]]

Structural geologists use microscopic analysis of oriented thin sections of geological samples to observe the [[fabric (geology)|fabric]] within the rocks, which gives information about strain within the crystalline structure of the rocks. They also plot and combine measurements of geological structures to better understand the orientations of faults and folds to reconstruct the history of rock deformation in the area. In addition, they perform [[analogue modelling (geology)|analog]] and numerical experiments of rock deformation in large and small settings.

The analysis of structures is often accomplished by plotting the orientations of various features onto [[stereographic projection|stereonets]]. A stereonet is a stereographic projection of a sphere onto a plane, in which planes are projected as lines and lines are projected as points. These can be used to find the locations of fold axes, relationships between faults, and relationships between other geological structures.

Among the most well-known experiments in structural geology are those involving [[Accretionary wedge|orogenic wedges]], which are zones in which [[mountain]]s are built along [[convergent boundary|convergent]] tectonic plate boundaries.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi= 10.1146/annurev.ea.18.050190.000415 |title= Critical Taper Model of Fold-and-Thrust Belts and Accretionary Wedges |year= 1990 |author= Dahlen, F A |journal= Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences |volume= 18 |pages= 55–99|bibcode = 1990AREPS..18...55D }}</ref> In the analog versions of these experiments, horizontal layers of sand are pulled along a lower surface into a back stop, which results in realistic-looking patterns of faulting and the growth of a [[critical taper|critically tapered]] (all angles remain the same) orogenic wedge.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi= 10.1016/S0191-8141(97)00096-5 |title= Material transfer in accretionary wedges from analysis of a systematic series of analog experiments |year= 1998 |author= Gutscher, M |journal= Journal of Structural Geology |volume= 20 |pages= 407–416 |issue= 4|bibcode = 1998JSG....20..407G |last2= Kukowski |first2= Nina |last3= Malavieille |first3= Jacques |last4= Lallemand |first4= Serge }}</ref> Numerical models work in the same way as these analog models, though they are often more sophisticated and can include patterns of erosion and uplift in the mountain belt.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi= 10.1146/annurev.ea.23.050195.002111 |title= Modeling the Topographic Evolution of Collisional Belts |year= 1995 |author= Koons, P O |journal= Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences |volume= 23 |pages= 375–408|bibcode = 1995AREPS..23..375K }}</ref> This helps to show the relationship between erosion and the shape of a mountain range.

==Planetary geology==
[[File:Mars Viking 21i093.png|thumb|Surface of Mars as photographed by the [[Viking 2]] lander December 9, 1977]]

{{Main|Planetary geology}}
With the advent of [[space exploration]] in the twentieth century, geologists have begun to look at other planetary bodies in the same ways that have been developed to study the [[Earth]]. This new field of study is called [[planetary geology]] (sometimes known as astrogeology) and relies on known geological principles to study other bodies of the solar system. This is a major aspect of [[planetary science]], and largely focuses on the [[terrestrial planets]], [[icy moon]]s, [[asteroid]]s, [[comet]]s, and [[meteorite]]s. However, some planetary geophysicists study the [[giant planet]]s and [[exoplanet]]s.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Laughlin |first1=Gregory |last2=Lissauer |first2=Jack |title=Treatise on Geophysics |chapter=Exoplanetary Geophysics: An Emerging Discipline |year=2015 |pages=673–694 |doi=10.1016/B978-0-444-53802-4.00186-X |arxiv=1501.05685 |isbn=9780444538031 |s2cid=118743781 }}</ref>

Although the Greek-language-origin prefix ''[[wikt:geo-|geo]]'' refers to Earth, "geology" is often used in conjunction with the names of other planetary bodies when describing their composition and internal processes: examples are "the [[geology of Mars]]" and "[[Lunar geology]]". Specialized terms such as ''selenology'' (studies of the Moon), ''areology'' (of Mars), etc., are also in use.

Although planetary geologists are interested in studying all aspects of other planets, a significant focus is to search for evidence of past or present life on other worlds. This has led to many missions whose primary or ancillary purpose is to examine planetary bodies for evidence of life. One of these is the [[Phoenix lander]], which analyzed [[Mars|Martian]] polar soil for water, chemical, and mineralogical constituents related to biological processes.

===Economic geology===
{{Main|Economic geology}}

Economic geology is a branch of geology that deals with aspects of economic minerals that humankind uses to fulfill various needs. Economic minerals are those extracted profitably for various practical uses. Economic geologists help locate and manage the Earth's [[natural resource]]s, such as petroleum and coal, as well as mineral resources, which include metals such as iron, copper, and uranium.

====Mining geology====
{{Main|Mining}}
[[Mining geology]] consists of the extractions of mineral resources from the Earth. Some resources of economic interests include [[gemstone]]s, [[metal]]s such as [[gold]] and [[copper]], and many minerals such as [[asbestos]], [[perlite]], [[mica]], [[phosphate]]s, [[zeolites]], [[clay]], [[pumice]], [[quartz]], and [[silica]], as well as elements such as [[sulfur]], [[chlorine]], and [[helium]].

====Petroleum geology====

Engineering geology is the application of geological principles to engineering practice for the purpose of assuring that the geological factors affecting the location, design, construction, operation, and maintenance of engineering works are properly addressed. Engineering geology is distinct from [[geological engineering]], particularly in North America.

In the field of [[civil engineering]], geological principles and analyses are used in order to ascertain the mechanical principles of the material on which structures are built. This allows tunnels to be built without collapsing, bridges and skyscrapers to be built with sturdy foundations, and buildings to be built that will not settle in clay and mud.<ref>{{Cite book |isbn=978-0-534-55144-5 |author=Das, Braja M. |year=2006 |publisher=Thomson Learning|location=England |title=Principles of geotechnical engineering}}</ref>

===Hydrology===
{{Main|Hydrogeology}}

Geology and geological principles can be applied to various environmental problems such as [[stream restoration]], the restoration of [[brownfields]], and the understanding of the interaction between [[Habitat (ecology)|natural habitat]] and the geological environment. Groundwater hydrology, or [[hydrogeology]], is used to locate groundwater,<ref name="Hamilton, Pixie A. 1995 217">{{Cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1745-6584.1995.tb00276.x |title=Effects of Agriculture on Ground-Water Quality in Five Regions of the United States |year=1995 |author=Hamilton, Pixie A. |journal=Ground Water |volume=33 |pages=217–226 |last2=Helsel |first2=Dennis R. |issue=2 |bibcode=1995GrWat..33..217H |url=https://zenodo.org/record/1230722 |access-date=2020-08-29 |archive-date=2020-10-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201031082104/https://zenodo.org/record/1230722 |url-status=live }}</ref> which can often provide a ready supply of uncontaminated water and is especially important in arid regions,<ref>{{Cite journal |doi=10.1080/07900629948916 |title=Water Scarcity in the Twenty-first Century |year=1999 |author=Seckler, David |journal=International Journal of Water Resources Development |volume=15 |issue=1–2 |pages=29–42 |last2=Barker |first2=Randolph |last3=Amarasinghe |first3=Upali}}</ref> and to monitor the spread of contaminants in groundwater wells.<ref name="Hamilton, Pixie A. 1995 217"/><ref>{{Cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1745-6584.1988.tb00397.x |title=Arsenic in Ground Water of the Western United States |year=1988 |author=Welch, Alan H. |journal=Ground Water |volume=26 |pages=333–347 |last2=Lico |first2=Michael S. |last3=Hughes |first3=Jennifer L. |issue=3|bibcode=1988GrWat..26..333W }}</ref>

The study of the physical material of the Earth dates back at least to [[ancient Greece]] when [[Theophrastus]] (372–287 BCE) wrote the work ''[[Theophrastus#On stones|Peri Lithon]]'' (''On Stones''). During the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] period, [[Pliny the Elder]] wrote in detail of the many minerals and metals, then in practical use – even correctly noting the origin of [[amber]]. Additionally, in the 4th century BCE [[Aristotle]] made critical observations of the slow rate of geological change. He observed the composition of the land and formulated a theory where the Earth changes at a slow rate and that these changes cannot be observed during one person's lifetime. Aristotle developed one of the first evidence-based concepts connected to the geological realm regarding the rate at which the Earth physically changes.<ref>Moore, Ruth. ''The Earth We Live On''.

In his paper, he explained his theory that the Earth must be much older than had previously been supposed to allow enough time for mountains to be eroded and for [[sediment]]s to form new rocks at the bottom of the sea, which in turn were raised up to become dry land. Hutton published a two-volume version of his ideas in 1795.<ref>Gutenberg ebook links: ([https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12861 Vol. 1] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200914043214/http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12861 |date=2020-09-14 }}, [https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14179 Vol. 2] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200809183159/https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14179 |date=2020-08-09 }})</ref>

Followers of Hutton were known as ''[[Plutonism|Plutonists]]'' because they believed that some rocks were formed by ''vulcanism'', which is the deposition of lava from volcanoes, as opposed to the ''[[Neptunism|Neptunists]]'', led by [[Abraham Gottlob Werner|Abraham Werner]], who believed that all rocks had settled out of a large ocean whose level gradually dropped over time.

Almost every state in the Union was traversed and mapped by him, the [[Allegheny Mountains]] being crossed and recrossed some 50 times.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Greene, J.C. |author2=Burke, J.G. |year=1978|title= The Science of Minerals in the Age of Jefferson|journal= Transactions of the American Philosophical Society |series=New Series|volume= 68|issue= 4|pages=1–113 [39]|doi=10.2307/1006294|jstor=1006294 }}</ref> The results of his unaided labours were submitted to the [[American Philosophical Society]] in a memoir entitled ''Observations on the Geology of the United States explanatory of a Geological Map'', and published in the ''Society's Transactions'', together with the nation's first geological map.<ref>[http://www.davidrumsey.com/luna/servlet/detail/RUMSEY~8~1~959~60260:A-Map-of-the-United-States-of-Ameri?sort=Pub_Date%2CPub_List_No%2CSeries_No&qvq=q:Geology;sort:Pub_Date%2CPub_List_No%2CSeries_No;lc:RUMSEY~8~1&mi=2&trs=1282 Maclure's 1809 Geological Map] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140814020815/http://www.davidrumsey.com/luna/servlet/detail/RUMSEY~8~1~959~60260:A-Map-of-the-United-States-of-Ameri?sort=Pub_Date,Pub_List_No,Series_No&qvq=q:Geology;sort:Pub_Date,Pub_List_No,Series_No;lc:RUMSEY~8~1&mi=2&trs=1282 |date=2014-08-14 }}. davidrumsey.com</ref> This antedates [[William Smith (geologist)|William Smith]]'s geological map of England by six years, although it was constructed using a different classification of rocks.

[[Sir Charles Lyell]] (1797–1875) first published his famous book, ''[[Principles of Geology]]'',<ref>{{Cite book |isbn=978-0-226-49797-6 |author=Lyell, Charles |year=1991 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |title=Principles of geology}}</ref> in 1830. This book, which influenced the thought of [[Charles Darwin]], successfully promoted the doctrine of [[uniformitarianism]]. This theory states that slow geological processes have occurred throughout the [[History of Earth|Earth's history]] and are still occurring today. In contrast, [[catastrophism]] is the theory that Earth's features formed in single, catastrophic events and remained unchanged thereafter. Though Hutton believed in uniformitarianism, the idea was not widely accepted at the time.

Much of 19th-century geology revolved around the question of the [[Age of the Earth|Earth's exact age]]. Estimates varied from a few hundred thousand to billions of years.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi=10.1130/GSAT01701A.1 |title=John Perry's neglected critique of Kelvin's age for the Earth: A missed opportunity in geodynamics |year=2007 |author=England, Philip |journal=GSA Today |volume=17 |page=4 |last2=Molnar |first2=Peter |last3=Richter |first3=Frank|issue=1 |bibcode=2007GSAT...17R...4E |doi-access=free }}</ref> By the early 20th century, [[radiometric dating]] allowed the Earth's age to be estimated at two billion years. The awareness of this vast amount of time opened the door to new theories about the processes that shaped the planet.

Some of the most significant advances in 20th-century geology have been the development of the theory of [[plate tectonics]] in the 1960s and the refinement of estimates of the planet's age. Plate tectonics theory arose from two separate geological observations: [[seafloor spreading]] and [[continental drift]]. The theory revolutionized the [[Earth sciences]]. Today the Earth is known to be approximately 4.5 billion years old.<ref name="4.54 book" />
