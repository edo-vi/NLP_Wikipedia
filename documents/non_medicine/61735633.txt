A '''fact box''' is a simplified display format that presents [[Evidence-based medicine|evidence based]] data about the benefits and harms of [[Therapy|medical treatments]], [[Screening (medicine)|screenings]] or interventions.<ref name="McDowell_etal_2016">McDowell, M., Rebitschek, F.

==Fact box: Main features==

There are several key features of a fact box.<ref name="McDowell_etal_2016"></ref> First, a '''summary statement''' describes the benefits and harms of a medical treatment without giving an explicit recommendation about which option is optimal for the reader. To avoid any ambiguities in interpreting the content, '''explicit and exhaustive information''' about the target [[population]] (e.g. gender, age range), date or time span of data collection and all additional information that may have an influence on the understanding of the reported facts are presented. To inform the user about the '''most important benefits and harms''', these are stated explicitly, preferably as a list of statements or questions. Moreover, a fact box presents '''comparisons of outcomes''', usually between [[treatment and control groups]], which are based on research results (preferably [[Meta-analysis|meta-analyses]] or [[Systematic review|systematic reviews]], or [[randomized controlled trials]]). To promote a good understanding of the results, an '''[[Effect size|effect measure]]''' for each group should be provided in terms of frequencies, i.e. absolute numbers out of a given sample size of, e.g., 100 or 1000 cases. To report the '''current state of [[scientific evidence]]''', for continuous [[Measurement|measurements]] common [[descriptive statistics]] like [[mean]], [[Mean absolute difference|mean difference]] or [[median]] should be presented; in case of unquantifiable outcomes the evidence can be described in a statement. Finally, '''sources for all information''' have to be listed and a date when the material was '''assembled or updated''' needs to be provided.

==Fact box: Use and implementation==

Based on an early format known as the [[balance sheet]],<ref> Eddy, D.M. (1990). Comparing benefits and harms: the balance sheet. Journal of the American Medical Association, 263(18), 2493-2505 [[doi:10.1001/jama.1990.03440180103043]]</ref> this simple tabular format has been adopted by different health organizations, e.g. [[National Health and Medical Research Council]],<ref>National Health and Medical Research Council.

In the current format, fact boxes have been developed for use with lay audiences to communicate about prescription medications (e.g., the drugs facts box<ref name="Schwartz_etal_2009"></ref><ref>Schwartz, L.M., Woloshin, S., & Welch, H.G.
