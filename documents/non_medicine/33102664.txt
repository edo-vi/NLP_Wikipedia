'''Porcine adenovirus''' (aka pADV 1-5 or pADV A-C) is a virus in the family ''[[Adenoviridae]]''. It causes mild gastrointestinal diseases in [[pig]]s and is thought to contribute to multifactorial porcine respiratory diseases complexes.<ref>{{cite book |title=Veterinary Medicine : A Textbook of the Diseases of Cattle, Horses, Sheep, Pigs and Goats |isbn=978-0-7020-5246-0 |page=241 |edition=Edition 11|last1=Constable |first1=Peter D. |last2=Hinchcliff |first2=Kenneth W. |last3=Done |first3=Stanley H. |last4=Gruenberg |first4=Walter |date=22 December 2016 |publisher=Elsevier }}</ref> Several strains of the virus can be found worldwide, and transmission occurs [[Horizontal transmission|horizontally]] by the [[Fecalâ€“oral route|fecal-oral route]].

==Clinical signs==
Infection is often [[subclinical]], and when clinical signs are seen they are mild and short-lived.{{cn|date=October 2022}}

Gastrointestinal signs such as [[diarrhoea]], [[Anorexia (symptom)|anorexia]] and [[dehydration]] are most commonly seen in [[Domestic pig|piglets]]. Reproductive signs such as [[abortion]] can be seen in adult [[Suidae|sows]].{{cn|date=October 2022}}

Respiratory signs such as coughing can be seen if the infection is part of a multifactorial respiratory disease complex.{{cn|date=October 2022}}

==Diagnosis and treatment==
[[Histology]], [[virus isolation]], [[electron microscopy]], [[immunoperoxidase]] and [[Immunofluorescence|immunofluorescent staining]], [[immunodiffusion]], [[Complement fixation tests|complement fixation]], virus neutralisation and [[ELISA]] can all be used to confirm diagnosis.{{cn|date=October 2022}}

Generally no treatment is required.{{cn|date=October 2022}}
