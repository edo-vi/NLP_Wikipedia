A '''vaccination policy''' is a [[health policy]] adopted in order to prevent the spread of [[infectious disease]]. These policies are generally put into place by State or local governments, but may also be set by private facilities, such as workplaces or schools.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2018-09-25 |title=State Immunization Laws for Healthcare Workers and Patients {{!}} CDC |url=https://www2.cdc.gov/vaccines/statevaccsApp/ |access-date=2022-07-08 |website=2.cdc.gov |language=en-us |archive-date=9 July 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220709004537/https://www2.cdc.gov/vaccines/statevaccsApp/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=2021-10-11 |title=What Colleges Require the COVID-19 Vaccine? {{!}} BestColleges |url=https://www.bestcolleges.com/news/2021/10/11/list-of-colleges-that-require-covid-19-vaccine/ |access-date=2022-07-08 |website=Bestcolleges.com |language=en-US |archive-date=24 March 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220324003605/https://www.bestcolleges.com/news/2021/10/11/list-of-colleges-that-require-covid-19-vaccine/ |url-status=live }}</ref> Many policies have been developed and implemented since [[vaccine]]s were first made widely available.

The main purpose of implementing a vaccination policy is complete [[Eradication of infectious diseases|eradication]] of a disease, as was done with [[smallpox]]. This, however, can be a difficult feat to accomplish or even confirm. Many governmental public health agencies (such as the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] or [[European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control|ECDC]]) rely on vaccination policies to create a [[herd immunity]] within their populations. [[National Immunization Technical Advisory Group|Immunization advisory committees]] are usually responsible for providing those in leadership positions with information used to make [[Evidence-based medicine|evidence-based decisions]] regarding vaccines and other health policies.

Vaccination policies vary from country to country, with some mandating them and others strongly recommending them. Some places only require them for people utilizing government services, like welfare or public schools. A government or facility may pay for all or part of the costs of vaccinations, such as in a national [[vaccination schedule]],<ref>{{Cite web |title=Coronavirus immunisation programme |url=https://www.fhi.no/en/id/vaccines/coronavirus-immunisation-programme/ |access-date=2022-07-08 |website=Norwegian Institute of Public Health |language=en |archive-date=16 July 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230716024159/https://www.fhi.no/en/id/corona/coronavirus-immunisation-programme/ |url-status=live }}</ref> or job requirement.<ref>{{Cite web |last=CDC |date=2022-06-19 |title=COVID-19 Vaccination |url=https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/How-Do-I-Get-a-COVID-19-Vaccine.html |access-date=2022-07-08 |website=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |language=en-us |archive-date=9 July 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220709004547/https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/How-Do-I-Get-a-COVID-19-Vaccine.html |url-status=live }}</ref> Cost-benefit analyses of vaccinations have shown that there is an economic incentive to implement policies, as vaccinations save the State time and money by reducing the burden preventable diseases and epidemics have on healthcare facilities and funds.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Diseases & Vaccines {{!}} immunizecanada |url=https://immunize.ca/diseases-vaccines |access-date=2022-07-08 |website=immunize.ca |archive-date=6 July 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220706135241/https://immunize.ca/diseases-vaccines |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |author=Editorial Board |date=2016-02-16 |title=Vaccines save lives – and money |url=https://www.vaccinestoday.eu/stories/vaccines-save-lives-and-money/ |access-date=2022-07-09 |website=VaccinesToday |language=en-US |archive-date=3 July 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220703023915/https://www.vaccinestoday.eu/stories/vaccines-save-lives-and-money/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Vaccines Save Lives |url=https://www.ahip.org/news/articles/vaccines-save-lives |access-date=2022-07-09 |website=AHIP |language=en |archive-date=9 March 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230309064842/https://www.ahip.org/news/articles/vaccines-save-lives |url-status=live }}</ref>

==Goals==
===Individual and herd immunity===
[[File:Herd immunity.svg|thumb|<!--[[wp:caption]] "Not every image ..."-->]]
Vaccination policies aim to produce immunity to [[vaccine-preventable diseases|preventable diseases]]. Besides individual protection from getting ill, some vaccination policies also aim to provide the community as a whole with [[herd immunity]]. Herd immunity refers to the idea that the pathogen will have trouble spreading when a significant part of the population has immunity against it, reducing the effect an infectious disease has on society. This protects those unable to get the vaccine due to medical conditions, such as [[immune disorder]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncsl.org/research/health/immunizations-policy-issues-overview.aspx|title=Immunizations Policy Issues Overview|first=National Conference of State|last=Legislatures|website=Ncsl.org|access-date=22 July 2017|archive-date=2 April 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200402194725/http://www.ncsl.org/research/health/immunizations-policy-issues-overview.aspx|url-status=live}}</ref> However, for herd immunity to be effective in a population, a majority of those who are vaccine-eligible must be vaccinated.<ref name=pmid26691123>{{cite journal |last1=Hendrix |first1=Kristin S. |last2=Sturm |first2=Lynne A. |last3=Zimet |first3=Gregory D. |last4=Meslin |first4=Eric M. |title=Ethics and Childhood Vaccination Policy in the United States |journal=American Journal of Public Health |date=February 2016 |volume=106 |issue=2 |pages=273–278 |doi=10.2105/AJPH.2015.302952 |pmid=26691123 |pmc=4815604 }}</ref>

Compulsory vaccination is a difficult policy issue, requiring authorities to balance public health with individual liberty:
{{blockquote|Vaccination is unique among de facto mandatory requirements in the modern era, requiring individuals to accept the injection of medicine or medicinal agent into their bodies, and it has provoked a spirited opposition. This opposition began with the first vaccinations, has not ceased, and probably never will. From this reali{{not a typo|s}}ation arises a difficult issue: how should the mainstream medical authorities approach the anti-vaccination movement? A passive reaction could be construed as endangering the health of society, whereas a heavy-handed approach can threaten the values of individual liberty and freedom of expression that we cherish.<ref name="Wolfe RM, Sharp LK 430–2"/>}}

== Deliberate naturally acquired immunity through infection ==
In the United Kingdom, children are not vaccinated against [[chickenpox]] despite the availability of a [[Varicella vaccine|vaccine]] since the 1990s.

===Trust in vaccination===
Trust in vaccines and in the health system is an important element of public health programs that aim to deliver life-saving vaccines. Trust in vaccination and health care is an important indicator of government work and the effectiveness of the social policy. The success in overcoming diseases and in vaccination depends on the level of trust in vaccines and health care. The lack of trust in vaccines and immunization programs can lead to vaccine refusal, risking disease outbreaks, and challenging immunization goals in high- and low-income settings. Today, the medical and scientific communities obviously face a big challenge where vaccines are concerned, namely enhancing the trust with which the general public regards the entire endeavor. Indeed, earning the public's trust in public health is a big challenge. Accurately, studying the trust in vaccines, and understanding the factors that affect the reduction of trust, allows authorities to build an effective vaccine campaign and communication strategies to fight the disease. Trust is a key parameter to work with before and while undertaking any vaccine campaigns. The state is responsible for providing smart communication, and to inform a population about diseases, vaccines, and the risks of both. The WHO recommends that states work long-term, to build population resilience against vaccine myths and scares, to develop a strong campaign that is well prepared to respond to any event that may erode trust, and respond immediately to any event which may erode trust in health authorities.<ref name=vaccinationandtrust>{{cite web

==International Organizations==
In 2006, the World Health Organization and [[UNICEF]] created the Global Immunization Vision and Strategy (GIVS). This organization created a ten-year strategy with four main goals:<ref>{{cite web |title=Global Immunization Vision and Strategy |url=https://www.who.int/immunization/givs/en/ |website=Immunization, Vaccines and Biologicals |publisher=World Health Organization |date=1 December 2013 |access-date=24 April 2015 |archive-date=24 April 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150424112930/http://www.who.int/immunization/givs/en/ |url-status=dead }}</ref>
* to immunize more people against more diseases
* to introduce a range of newly available vaccines and technologies
* to integrate other critical health interventions with immunization
* to manage vaccination programmes within the context of global interdependence

The [[Global Vaccination Action Plan]] was created by the World Health Organization and endorsed by the [[World Health Assembly]] in 2012. The plan which is set from 2011 to 2020 is intended to "strengthen routine immunization to meet vaccination coverage targets; accelerate control of vaccine-preventable diseases with polio eradication as the first milestone; introduce new and improved vaccines and spur research and development for the next generation of vaccines and technologies."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.who.int/immunization/global_vaccine_action_plan/en/ |title=Global Vaccine Action Plan 2011 – 2020 |date=5 February 2015 |access-date=24 April 2015 |publisher=World Health Organization |website=Immunization, Vaccines and Biologicals |archive-date=24 April 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150424051613/http://www.who.int/immunization/global_vaccine_action_plan/en/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Argentina===
In December 2018, Argentina enacted a new vaccine policy requiring all persons who are medically able, both adults and children, to be vaccinated against specified diseases. Proof of vaccination is required to attend any level of school, file for a marriage license, and request any kind of government ID, including a passport or driver's license. The law requires the government to pay for all aspects of vaccinations and deems vaccination to be a national emergency; vaccines are exempt from internal and customs taxes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.infobae.com/salud/2018/12/17/todo-lo-que-tenes-que-saber-de-la-nueva-ley-de-vacunacion-en-argentina/|title=Todo lo que hay que saber de la nueva ley de vacunación en Argentina|publisher=Infobae|first=Víctor|last=Ingrassia|date=17 December 2018|language=es|access-date=19 January 2019|archive-date=20 January 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190120043027/https://www.infobae.com/salud/2018/12/17/todo-lo-que-tenes-que-saber-de-la-nueva-ley-de-vacunacion-en-argentina/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://noticias.perfil.com/2018/12/21/como-es-la-nueva-ley-de-vacunas/|title=Cómo es la nueva ley de vacunas|publisher=Noticias|first=Andrea|last=Gentil|date=21 December 2018|language=es|access-date=19 January 2019|archive-date=19 January 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190119230725/https://noticias.perfil.com/2018/12/21/como-es-la-nueva-ley-de-vacunas/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="auto1"/><ref name="auto2"/>

The rate of flu vaccination, for example, was 67.9% among schoolchildren in 1979 but dropped down to approximately 20% in 1998–1999. With the rapidly [[Aging of Japan|aging society issue]], the decline among schoolchildren hit the elderly generation. In 1998–1999 season, deadly flu outbreak spread widely in nursing homes for the elderly as well as inpatients wards.

In addition to legal and social risk concerns, an issue of the decision-making process underlies the vaccine gap. Unlike the [[Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices]] (ACIP) in the United States, a centralized permanent advisory committee for vaccination policy was not organized in Japan until 2009, when a deadly flu outbreak struck the nation. Since the committee kick-off, however, the vaccine gap has been gradually improved.<ref name=IPSS>{{cite journal  |url=http://www.ipss.go.jp/syoushika/bunken/data/pdf/kai192.pdf |title=特集:予防接種の国際比較 |trans-title=Global comparative study for vaccination |journal=海外社会保障研究 |volume=Autumn 2015 |issue=192 |publisher=[[National Institute of Population and Social Security Research]] (IPSS) |author1=加藤智章 (Tomoaki Kato, preface at p.4-) |author2=齋藤昭彦 (Akihiko Saito, about the United States at p.6-) |author3=中村安秀 (Yasuhide Nakamura, about developing countries at p.20-) |author4=松本勝明 (Katsuaki Matsumoto, about Germany at p.25-) |author5=福士由紀 (Yuki Fukushi, about China at p.30-) |year=2015 |access-date=26 February 2020 |archive-date=26 February 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200226022836/http://www.ipss.go.jp/syoushika/bunken/data/pdf/kai192.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=PhRMA/>

Latvia appears unique in that it compels health care providers to obtain the signatures of those who decline vaccination. Individuals have the right to refuse a vaccination, but if they do so, health providers have a duty to explain the health consequences.

Vaccines that are not mandatory are not publicly funded, so the cost for those must be borne by parents or employers, she adds. Funded vaccinations include tuberculosis, diphtheria, measles, hepatitis B, human papillomavirus for 12-year-old girls, and tick-borne encephalitis until age 18 in endemic areas and for orphans.

Beginning at age 14, minors can consent to vaccination in Latvia without parental permission.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://bnn-news.com/latvia-to-commence-covid-19-vaccination-of-12-to15-year-olds-2-june-225367 |title=Latvia to commence Covid-19 vaccination of 12 to15-year-olds 2 June |work=Baltic News Network |date=1 June 2021 |access-date=2 August 2021 |archive-date=2 August 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210802103601/https://bnn-news.com/latvia-to-commence-covid-19-vaccination-of-12-to15-year-olds-2-june-225367 |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Malaysia===
In [[Malaysia]], mass vaccination is practised in public schools. The vaccines may be administered by a [[school nurse]] or a team of other medical staff from outside the school. All the children in a given school year are vaccinated as a [[Cohort (statistics)|cohort]]. For example, children may receive the [[oral polio vaccine]] in Year One of primary school (about six or seven years of age), the [[Bacillus Calmette Guérin|BCG]] in Year Six, and the [[MMR vaccine|MMR]] in Form Three of secondary school. Therefore, most people have received their core vaccines by the time they finish secondary school.<ref>{{cite report | title = School Immunization Programme in Malaysia – 24 February to 4 March 2008 | url = https://www.who.int/immunization/programmes_systems/policies_strategies/Malaysia-school-immunization.pdf?ua=1 | first1 = Sigrun | last1 = Roesel | first2 = Kaushik | last2 = Banerjee | name-list-style = vanc | publisher = World Health Organization | date = | access-date = 5 October 2020 | archive-date = 17 June 2020 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20200617210018/https://www.who.int/immunization/programmes_systems/policies_strategies/Malaysia-school-immunization.pdf?ua=1 | url-status = live }}</ref>

===Slovenia===
According to a 2011 publication in ''[[CMAJ]]'':<ref name=walkinshaw2011/> Slovenia has one of the world's most aggressive and comprehensive vaccination programs. Its program is mandatory for nine designated diseases. Within the first three months of life, infants must be vaccinated for tuberculosis, tetanus, polio, pertussis, and Haemophilus influenza type B. Within 18 months, vaccines are required for measles, mumps, and rubella, and finally, before a child starts school, the child must be vaccinated for hepatitis B. While a medical exemption request can be submitted to a committee, such an application for reasons of religion or conscience would not be acceptable. Failure to comply results in a fine and compliance rates top 95%, Kraigher says, adding that for nonmandatory vaccines, such as the one for human papillomavirus, coverage is below 50%.

Mandatory vaccination against measles was introduced in 1968 and since 1978, all children receive two doses of vaccine with a compliance rate of more than 95%.<ref>{{cite conference |title=Mandatory measles vaccination – are healthcare workers really safe? |author1=Mrvic T |author2=Petrovec M |author3=Breskvar M |author4=Zupanc TL |author5=Logar M |conference=22nd European Congress of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases |date=31 March 2012 |access-date=24 April 2015 |location=London |url=http://registration.akm.ch/einsicht.php?XNABSTRACT_ID=145466&XNSPRACHE_ID=2&XNKONGRESS_ID=161&XNMASKEN_ID=900 |archive-date=21 October 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021150922/http://registration.akm.ch/einsicht.php?XNABSTRACT_ID=145466&XNSPRACHE_ID=2&XNKONGRESS_ID=161&XNMASKEN_ID=900 |url-status=live }}</ref> For TBE, the vaccination rate in 2007 was estimated to be 12.4% of the general population in 2007.

All fifty states in the U.S. mandate immunizations for children to enroll in public school, but various exemptions are available depending on the state.

The [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] (AAP) advises physicians to respect the refusal of parents to vaccinate their child after adequate discussion, unless the child is put at significant risk of harm (e.g., during an epidemic, or after a deep and contaminated puncture wound). Under such circumstances, the AAP states that parental refusal of immunization constitutes a form of [[medical neglect]] and should be reported to state [[child protective services]] agencies.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Diekema DS |title=Responding to parental refusals of immunization of children |journal=Pediatrics |volume=115 |issue=5 |pages=1428–31 |date=May 2005 |pmid=15867060 |doi=10.1542/peds.2005-0316 |doi-access=free}}</ref> Several states allow minors to legally consent to vaccination over parental objections under the [[mature minor doctrine]].

====Schools====
The United States has a long history of school vaccination requirements. The first school vaccination requirement was enacted in the 1850s in Massachusetts to prevent the spread of smallpox.<ref name=McAllister-Grum_2017>{{cite journal | vauthors = McAllister-Grum K | title = Pigments and Vaccines: Evaluating the Constitutionality of Targeting Melanin Groups for Mandatory Vaccination | journal = The Journal of Legal Medicine | volume = 37 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 217–247 | year = 2017 | pmid = 28910223 | doi = 10.1080/01947648.2017.1303288 | s2cid = 205505188}}</ref> The school vaccination requirement was put in place after the compulsory school attendance law caused a rapid increase in the number of children in public schools, increasing the risk of smallpox outbreaks. The early movement towards school vaccination laws began at the local level including counties, cities, and boards of education. By 1827, [[Boston]] had become the first city to mandate that all children entering public schools show proof of vaccination.<ref name=Hodge2001>{{cite journal | vauthors = Hodge JG, Gostin LO | title = School vaccination requirements: historical, social, and legal perspectives | journal = Kentucky Law Journal | volume = 90 | issue = 4 | pages = 831–90 | year = 2001 | pmid = 15868682}}</ref> In addition, in 1855 the [[Massachusetts General Court]] had established its own statewide vaccination requirements for all students entering school, this influenced other states to implement similar statewide vaccination laws in schools as seen in [[New York (state)|New York]] in 1862, [[Connecticut]] in 1872, [[Pennsylvania]] in 1895, and later the Midwest, South, and the Western United States. By 1963, 20 states had school vaccination laws.<ref name=Hodge2001 />

These vaccination laws resulted in political debates throughout the United States, as those opposed to vaccination sought to repeal local policies and state laws.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Tolley |first1=Kim |title=School Vaccination Wars |journal=History of Education Quarterly |date=May 2019 |volume=59 |issue=2 |pages=161–194 |doi=10.1017/heq.2019.3|doi-access=free }}</ref> An example of this political controversy occurred in 1893, in [[Chicago]], where less than ten percent of the children were vaccinated, despite the twelve-year-old state law.<ref name=Hodge2001 /> Resistance was seen at the local level of the school district as some local school boards and superintendents opposed the state vaccination laws, leading the state board health inspectors to examine vaccination policies in schools. Resistance proceeded during the mid-1900s and in 1977 a nationwide Childhood Immunization Initiative was developed with the goal of increasing vaccination rates among children to ninety percent by 1979. During the two-year period of observation, the initiative reviewed the immunization records of more than 28 million children and vaccinated children who had not received the recommended vaccines.<ref name=malone>{{cite journal|last=Malone|first=Kevin M|author2=Hinman, Alan R |title=The Public Health Imperative and Individual Rights|journal=Law in Public Health Practice|year=2003|pages=262–84}}</ref>

In 1922, the constitutionality of childhood vaccination was examined in the Supreme Court case ''[[Zucht v. King]]''. The court decided that a school could deny admission to children who failed to provide a certification of vaccination for the protection of the public health.<ref name=malone /> In 1987, there was a measles epidemic in [[Maricopa County, Arizona]], and ''[[Maricopa County Health Department v. Harmon]]'' examined the arguments of an individual's right to education over the state's need to protect against the spread of disease. The court decided that it is prudent to take action to combat the spread of disease by denying unvaccinated children a place in school until the risk for the spread of measles had passed.<ref name=malone />

Schools in the United States require an updated immunization record for all incoming and returning students. While all states require an immunization record, this does not mean all students must get vaccinated. Exemptions are determined at a state level. In the United States, exemptions take one of three forms: medical, in which a vaccine is contraindicated because of a component ingredient allergy or existing medical condition; religious; and personal philosophical opposition. As of 2019, 45 states allow religious exemptions, with some states requiring proof of religious membership. Until 2019, only [[Mississippi]], [[West Virginia]] and [[California]] did not permit religious exemptions.<ref name=calibill>{{cite web|url=https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/california-governor-signs-strict-school-vaccine-legislation/ar-AAcm68T?ocid=ansnewsap11|title=California governor signs strict school vaccine legislation|author=Horowitz, Julia|publisher=Associated Press|date=30 June 2015|access-date=30 June 2015|archive-date=3 July 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150703005903/http://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/california-governor-signs-strict-school-vaccine-legislation/ar-AAcm68T?ocid=ansnewsap11|url-status=live}}</ref> However, the [[2019 measles outbreak]] led to the repeal of religious exemptions in the state of New York and for the MMR vaccination in the state of Washington.
