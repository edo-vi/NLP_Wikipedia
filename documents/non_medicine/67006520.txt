== Overview ==
Orogenic gold deposits are hosted by [[shear zone]]s in [[Orogeny|orogenic belts]], specifically in metamorphosed [[Forearc|fore-arc]] and [[Back-arc region|back-arc]] regions and were formed during syn- to late [[Metamorphic facies|metamorphic]] stages of orogeny.<ref name="Richard J.

=== Historical term ===
[[Waldemar Lindgren]] made the first widely accepted classification of gold deposits and introduced the term “[[mesothermal]]” for mostly gold-only deposits in metamorphic terranes and [[greenstone belt]]s.<ref>{{citation|surname1=Waldemar Lindgren|title=Mineral deposits|publisher=McGraw-Hill Book Company, inc.|date=1913|language=German|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Bo4NAAAAYAAJ&dq=Mineral+Deposits&pg=PP1|access-date=2021-02-10
}}</ref> The term mesothermal refers to temperatures between 175 and 300&nbsp;°C and a formation depth of 1.2–3.6&nbsp;km. In 1993, the term orogenic gold deposits was introduced, as gold deposits of this type have a similar origin and gold mineralization is structurally controlled.

== Genetic models ==
Orogenic gold deposits formed in metamorphosed terranes of all ages that have little in common except for being sites of complexity and low mean stress.<ref name="J. Vearncombe, M. Zelic-2015" /> For this reason, a discussion of the gold deposit formation in a universal genetic model is most difficult and several models have been considered. The fundamental control of the chemical signature of orogenic gold fluids can most likely be found in the processes that take place in the source region.<ref name="Goldfarb 2005"/> Therefore, the discussion about genetic models of orogenic gold deposits concentrates on the possible source of gold-bearing fluids.

=== Mid-crustal fluid source ===
A model that fits most of the gold provinces and provides some of the major gold resources, entails a metamorphic fluid source. In this style of gold deposit, gold and other elements have been released into metamorphic fluids, from material accreted to a craton during [[subduction]]-related scenarios.<ref name="sciencedirect.com"/> Most likely, fluids have been produced under prograde [[Metamorphic facies|greenschist- to amphibolite-facies]] metamorphism (220–450&nbsp;°C and 1–5 Kbar).<ref name="Richard J.

=== Sub-crustal fluid source ===
The model of a sub-crustal source is similar to the middle-crustal model. In both cases fluids and metals formed from volcanic and sedimentary products in tectonic processes, but also show differences in the origin of the source and the processes involved.<ref name="Goldfarb 2–26"/> This model is associated with fluid ascent from devolatilization of a [[Subduction|subducting]] slab and overlying sediment wedge.<ref name="Goldfarb 2–26"/> Oceanic mantle, crust and overlying sediments were subducted, and rapidly heated, and H-O-C-rich vapours released fluids during heating, at temperatures below 650&nbsp;°C and depths of 100&nbsp;km.<ref name="Goldfarb 2–26"/>

[[Serpentinite|Serpentinization]] (slab mantle hydration) may play an important role for two reasons.

Although efforts have been made to define a specific deformation structure associated with the formation of orogenic gold deposits,<ref name="Richard J. Goldfarb, Timothy Baker, Benoît Dubé, David I.

Orogenic gold deposits show a spatial relationship to structural discontinuities, including faults, fractures, dilatation zones and shear zones.<ref name="J. Vearncombe, M.

The mineralised structures indicate syn- to post-mineralisation displacements, such as [[slickenside]]s formed under hydrothermal conditions.
