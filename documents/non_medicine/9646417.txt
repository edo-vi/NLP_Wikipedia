'''Sticky mouse''' is a [[House mouse|murine]] possessing a gene mutation in the enzyme [[alanyl-tRNA synthetase]] (AARS).<ref name="pmid16906138">{{cite journal |vauthors=Roy H, Ibba M |title=Molecular biology: sticky end in protein synthesis |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=443 |issue=7107 |pages=41–2 |date=September 2006 |pmid=16906138 |doi=10.1038/nature05002|s2cid=5998660 }}</ref> The sticky mouse, with this particular mutation, presents a good model in which to investigate mechanisms of [[Neurodegeneration|neuronal degeneration]]. Its most immediately obvious symptom is a sticky secretion on the mouse's fur (thus the name); however, it is accompanied by lack of muscle control, [[ataxia]], [[alopecia]], loss of [[Purkinje cell]]s in the [[cerebellum]], and eventually, death.

Sticky [[house mouse|mouse]] is one of several [[animal]] mutants that are known to have problems in [[mRNA]] translation and are used in studies.<ref name="pmid17680008">{{cite journal |vauthors=Scheper GC, van der Knaap MS, Proud CG |title=Translation matters: protein synthesis defects in inherited disease |journal=[[Nat.
