'''Consumers United for Evidence-based Healthcare''' ('''CUE''') is a coalition of health advocacy consumer groups interested in [[evidence-based medicine|evidence-based healthcare]].<ref name="CUE">{{cite web|title=Consumers United for Evidence-Based Healthcare (CUE)| publisher=US Cochrane Center| url=http://consumersunited.org| accessdate=1 March 2017}}</ref> It was formed in 2003.

CUE provides leadership to other efforts aimed at involving patients in the research process, strengthening the voice of consumers in healthcare research, which has been called for over two decades<ref name="Dickersin">{{cite book | last1 =Dickersin | first1 =K | last2 =Schapner | first2 =L | editor-last =Moss | editor-first =KL | title =Reinventing medical research | chapter =Man-Made Medicine: Women's Health, Public Policy, and Reform | publisher =Duke University Press Books | edition =1st | date =1996 | location =Durham, NC | isbn =978-0822318163 | url-access =registration | url =https://archive.org/details/manmademedicinew0000moss }}</ref> but which has not always been successfully implemented free of commercial influence.<ref name="Kreis">{{cite journal | last1 =Kreis| first1 = J| last2 =Puhan | first2=MA |last3=Schüemann |first3=HJ |last4=Dickersin |first4=K | title = Consumer involvement in systematic reviews of comparative effectiveness research| journal = Health Expectations | volume = 16|issue=4|pages = 323–337| date = 2013| pmid=22390732 | doi=10.1111/j.1369-7625.2011.00722.x | pmc=5060681}}</ref> By creating opportunities for networking and learning, similar to those available to health professionals, CUE members can be empowered and have an ongoing source of information and tools about health issues of concern. This would, at least in theory, give the member groups an edge in advocacy activities.

Since its establishment, CUE members have been asked to testify on national committees, contribute letters to the biomedical literature, sit on national professional society steering groups and advisory panels, and many other contributions.<ref>{{cite web |title=Institute of Medicine Presentation to Committee on Determination of Essential Health Benefits |year=2011 |publisher=Institute of Medicine |url=http://www.iom.edu/~/media/Files/Activity%20Files/HealthServices/EssentialHealthBenefits/2011-JAN-12/130%202%20Warren.pdf }}{{Dead link|date=July 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Johnson |first=Lorraine |last2=Warren |first2=Barbara |date=2011 |title=Evidence-Based Practice and Health Advocacy Organizations |journal=The Journal of the American Medical Association |publisher=JAMA |volume=13 |issue=306 |pages=1443–1445 |doi=10.1001/jama.2011.1405 |pmid=21972305 }}</ref>

CUE also hosts social networking through Facebook groups and Twitter and contributes its views and support to international projects such as [[AllTrials]].

==CUE Partnership Clearinghouse==
In keeping with its role as a consumer-scientist partnership, CUE maintains a clearinghouse function which matches consumers with healthcare professional organizations so that the consumer voice may be incorporated into important healthcare decisions. Past partnerships have matched consumer representatives into research implementation processes such as clinical guidelines panels, grant-writing, peer review, and conference workshops.<ref name="Clearinghouse">{{cite web|title=CUE Partnership Clearinghouse| publisher=US Cochrane Center| url=http://consumersunited.org/opportunities-for-consumer-engagement/cue-partnership-clearinghouse| accessdate=1 March 2017}}</ref>

Through the CUE Clearinghouse, health professional organizations can request consumer representatives for their research/research implementation projects and consumers can respond directly to those requests. Since 2007, CUE has fostered over 75 partnerships between consumers and policymaking organizations, including 12 in 2014 alone.
 
To prepare all stakeholders for a panel with meaningful consumer engagement, CUE has created a series of short videos based on real-life interactions between professionals and patients participating on advisory panels. These videos demonstrate real-life scenarios and situations that professional guideline developers and consumer advocates serving on advisory panels are likely to encounter. They focus on specific steps in the advisory panel process such as preparing for a panel as a consumer, effectively moderating the panel as a Chair, and how to ensure that diverse opinions are heard, understood, and respected during advisory panel meetings.<ref name="Advisory">{{cite web|title=Resources for Serving on an Advisory Panel| publisher=US Cochrane Center| url=http://consumersunited.org/engagement| accessdate=4 October 2019}}</ref>
