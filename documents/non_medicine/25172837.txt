{{Race}}
Issues related to '''race and sports''' have been examined by [[scholar]]s for a long time.<ref name=autogenerated3>Lomax 2008, p. ix.</ref> Among these issues are racial [[discrimination]] in [[sport]]s as well as the observation that there are overrepresentations and underrepresentations of different [[Race (classification of human beings)|races]] in different sports.

Olympic 100&nbsp;m medallists in the early phase of the Modern Olympic Games were principally [[white people|white]], [[Western world|Western]] sprinters of European descent, largely reflecting the euro-centric make up of the nations that took part and the ideological environment of racial segregation at the time. As the Olympic competition began to attract wider international participation, athletes with African heritage began to reach and eventually dominate the 100&nbsp;m Olympic podium, particularly [[African-American]]s and [[Afro-Caribbean]]s.<ref name=Sears>Sears, Edward Seldon (2001).

[[Eddie Tolan]] became the first non-white winner of the event in 1932 and this signified the start of a prolonged period of success by black male sprinters; since 1932 only five men's Olympic champions in the event have not had significant African heritage. The women's event was dominated by runners of European descent until [[Wilma Rudolph]] won the title in 1960. Soviet and German women returned to the podium in the period from 1972 to 1980, but since then African-American and Jamaican women have won the great majority of 100&nbsp;m medals.<ref name=Sears/> Dominance in the men's event has been particularly pronounced from 1984 to 2016, during which time in a span of almost 40 years all the men's Olympic 100&nbsp;m finalists have been of African heritage.<ref>[[Matthew Syed|Syed, Matthew]] (2012-08-09).

In the [[Athletics at the 2020 Summer Olympics – Men's 100 metres|2020]] Olympics, Chinese sprinter [[Su Bingtian]] ran 9.83 in his semi-final heat and became the first athlete without African heritage to run sub-9.90 or sub-9.85 and the first athlete without African heritage to reach the final since [[Athletics at the 1980 Summer Olympics – Men's 100 metres|1980]] within the span of 40 years, setting the fastest [[60 metres]] split record en route.<ref name="Vazel">{{cite web|url=https://www.hmmrmedia.com/2021/10/tokyo-sprint-analysis/|title=Analyzing the Olympic 100-meter sprints|publisher=Analyzing the Olympic 100-meter sprints|date=2021-11-02|author=Pierre-Jean Vazel}}</ref> 9.83 is also the second fastest semi-final time and made him the fifth fastest man in the history of [[100 metres at the Olympics]] behind Usain Bolt, Yohan Blake, Justin Gatlin and Marcel Jacobs.

=== Endurance running ===
Many [[Nilotic peoples|Nilotic]] groups also excel in [[long distance running|long]] and [[middle distance running]]. [[Jon Entine]] has argued that this sporting prowess stems from their exceptional running economy.<ref>{{cite web|last=Entine|first=Jon|title=TABOO: Why Black Athletes Dominate Sports and Why We Are Afraid to Talk About It|url=http://www.jonentine.com/reviews/quokka_02.htm|publisher=Quokka|access-date=21 November 2013}}</ref> This in turn is a function of slim body morphology and slender legs,<ref name="saltin">Bengt Saltin: The Kenya project – Final report.

A study by Pitsiladis et al. (2006) questioning 404 elite distance runners from [[Kenya]] found that 76% of the international-class respondents hailed from the [[Kalenjin people|Kalenjin]] ethnic group and that 79% spoke a [[Nilotic languages|Nilotic language]].<ref name="Dcoeker">{{cite journal|first1=Vincent O. |last1=Onywera |first2=Robert A. |last2=Scott |first3=Michael K. |last3=Boit |first4=Yannis |last4=Pitsiladis| title=Demographic characteristics of elite Kenyan endurance runners|journal=Journal of Sports Sciences |year=2006 |volume=24 |issue=4 |pages=415–422 |doi=10.1080/02640410500189033 |pmid=16492605 |s2cid=16303504 |url=http://www.ku.ac.ke/images/stories/docs/publications/enviromental_human/Demographic-characteristics.pdf|access-date=20 June 2012}}</ref>

[[Joseph L. Graves]] argues that Kenyan athletes from the [[African Great Lakes]] region who have done well in long distance running all have come from high-altitude areas, whereas those from low-altitude areas do not perform particularly well. He also argues that [[Korea]]ns and [[Ecuador]]ians from high-altitude areas compete well with Kenyans in long-distance races. According to Graves, this suggests that it is the fact of having trained in a high altitude, combined with possible local level physiological adaptations to high-altitude environments that is behind the success in long distance running, not race.<ref name="PBS" />

Graves also argues that while it is superficially true that most of the world record-holders in the 100-meter dash are of West African heritage, they also all have partial genetic heritage from Europe and Native America, they have also all trained outside of West Africa, and West African nations have not trained any top-level runners. Graves says these factors make it impossible to say to which degree the success is best attributed to genetic or to environmental factors.<ref name="PBS">{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/race/000_About/002_04-background-01-06.htm |title=Interview With Joseph Graves, Jr. |year=2003 |work=Race – The Power of Illusion |publisher=Public Broadcasting Service |access-date=April 7, 2011 }}</ref> But later Graves found it possible: "Endurance runners are more likely to come from East Africa and sprinters from West Africa. That’s a fact. Genes play a major role in this.”<ref>{{Cite web |last=Entine |first=Jon |title=The DNA Olympics -- Jamaicans Win Sprinting 'Genetic Lottery' -- and Why We Should All Care |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonentine/2012/08/12/the-dna-olympics-jamaicans-win-sprinting-genetic-lottery-and-why-we-should-all-care/ |access-date=2023-07-13 |website=Forbes |language=en}}</ref>

=== Views in the United States ===
Various individuals, including scholars and [[sportswriter]]s, have commented on the apparent over-representations and under-representations of different races in different sports. [[African American]]s accounted for 75% of players in the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) near the end of 2008.<ref name=autogenerated4>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ncasports.org/Articles/2008_RGRC.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724084016/http://www.ncasports.org/Articles/2008_RGRC.pdf|url-status=dead|title=2008_RGRC.indd|archivedate=July 24, 2011}}</ref> According to the latest [[National Consortium for Academics and Sports]] equality report card, 65% of [[National Football League]] players were African Americans. However, in 2008, about 8.5% of [[Major League Baseball]] players were African American (who make up about 13% of the US population), and 29.1% were Hispanics of any race (compared with about 16% of the US population).<ref name=autogenerated4 /> In 2020, less than 5% of the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) players are black or of mixed black heritage.<ref name=":3">{{Cite web|last=Doyle|first=Terrence|date=2020-10-19|title=The NHL Says 'Hockey Is For Everyone.'

NCAA sports have mirrored the trends present in American professional sports. During the 2005–2006 season, black males comprised 46.9 percent of NCAA Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) and 58.9 percent of NCAA Division I basketball.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hawkins|first=Billy|title=The New Plantation: Black Athletes, College Sports, and Predominantly White NCAA Institutions|url=https://archive.org/details/newplantationbla00hawk|url-access=limited|year=2010|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/newplantationbla00hawk/page/n109 95]|isbn=9780230615175}}</ref> The NCAA statistics show a strong correlation between percentage of black athletes within a sport and the revenue generated by that sport. For example, University of North Carolina's 2007–2008 men's basketball team (the team was 59% black relative to the 3.7% black population of the institution as a whole) generated $17,215,199 in revenue, which comprised 30 percent of the school's athletic revenue for the year.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hawkins|first=Billy|title=The New Plantation: Black Athletes, College Sports, and Predominantly White NCAA Institutions|url=https://archive.org/details/newplantationbla00hawk|url-access=limited|year=2010|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/newplantationbla00hawk/page/n126 112]|isbn=9780230615175}}</ref> Given NCAA rules prohibiting the payment of players, some have come to see the structure of NCAA athletics as exploitative of college athletes. Some believe that since black athletes comprise a high percentage of athletes in high revenue college sports (FBS football and Division I Men's basketball), they are therefore the biggest losers in this arrangement.  Billy Hawkins argues that "the control over the Black male's body and profiting off its physical expenditure is in the hands of White males."<ref>{{cite book|last=Hawkins|first=Billy|title=The New Plantation: Black Athletes, College Sports, and Predominantly White NCAA Institutions|url=https://archive.org/details/newplantationbla00hawk|url-access=limited|year=2010|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/newplantationbla00hawk/page/n157 143]|isbn=9780230615175}}</ref> His position refers to a very high percentage of Division I universities controlled by white administrations that prosper greatly from the free labor produced by the revenue sports that are heavily populated by black athletes. This claim is substantiated by statistics, such as the 2005–2006 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament in which games started, and minutes played for black athletes were over double that of their white counterparts, with 68.7 percent of scoring in the tournament coming from black players.<ref name="Hawkins 2010">{{cite book|last=Hawkins|first=Billy|title=The New Plantation: Black Athletes, College Sports, and Predominantly White NCAA Institutions|year=2010|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=New York}}</ref>

Despite the frequency of such speculation, suggestions of biological differences in athletic ability between racial groups are considered unscientific.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Saini|first=Angela|date=23 July 2019|title=Sports and IQ: the persistence of race 'science' in competition|journal=Nature|volume=571|issue=7766|pages=474–475|doi=10.1038/d41586-019-02244-w|bibcode=2019Natur.571..474S|s2cid=198191524|doi-access=free}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Wiggins|first=David K.|title=More Than a Game: A History of the African American Experience in Sport|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|year=2018|isbn=978-1-5381-1498-8|pages=151}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=2003|title=Interview with Robert Graves Jr.|url=https://www.pbs.org/race/000_About/002_04-background-01-06.htm|website=PBS.org}}</ref>

==== "Black athletic superiority" ====
"Black athletic superiority" is the theory that [[black people]] possess certain [[Phenotypic trait|traits]] that are acquired through [[heredity|genetic]] and/or environmental factors that allow them to excel over other [[Race (classification of human beings)|races]] in [[Athletic sports|athletic competition]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Smith |first1=Earl |title=Race, Sport and the American Dream |year=2014 |publisher=CAP |isbn=978-1-61163-487-7 }}</ref> Whites are more likely to hold these views; however, some blacks and other racial groups do as well.<ref>Sheldon 2007, p. 33.</ref><ref>Wiggins 1997, p.197.</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Buffington|first=Daniel|author2=Todd Fraley |title=Skill in Black And White: Negotiating Media Images of Race in a Sporting Context.|journal=Journal of Communication Inquiry|volume=32|issue=3|year=2008|pages=292–310|doi=10.1177/0196859908316330|s2cid=146772218}}</ref> A 1991 poll in the United States indicated that half of the respondents agreed with the belief that "blacks have more natural physical ability".<!--Who conducted the poll? for what purpose?  What other questions were there?--><ref>Hoberman 1997, p. 146</ref>

Various hypotheses regarding racial differences of [[black people|black]] and [[white people]] and their possible effect on sports performance have been put forth since the later part of the nineteenth century by professionals in many various fields.<ref>Wiggins 1997, p. 177.</ref> In the United States, attention to the subject faded over the first two decades of the twentieth century as black athletes were eliminated from white organized sport and segregated to compete among themselves on their own amateur and professional teams.<ref name=autogenerated6>Wiggins 1997, p. 179.</ref> Interest in the subject was renewed after the [[1932 Summer Olympics]] in [[Los Angeles]] and [[Jesse Owens]]'s record-breaking performances at the 1935 Big Ten Track Championships.<ref name=autogenerated6 /> Regarding Jesse Owens's impressive four-gold medal performance in the following 1936 Olympics, the then U.S head coach remarked that "The Negro excels. It was not long ago that his ability to sprint and jump was a life-and-death matter to him in the jungle. His muscles are pliable, and his easy going disposition is a valuable aid to the mental and physical relaxation that a runner and jumper must have."<ref name="dx.doi.org">{{Cite journal|date=2003|title=The Debate on Race and Sports Crosses the Pond|journal=The Journal of Blacks in Higher Education|issue=39|pages=65–66|doi=10.2307/3134375|issn=1077-3711|jstor=3134375}}</ref>

In 1971, African-American [[sociology|sociologist]] [[Harry Edwards (sociologist)|Harry Edwards]] wrote: "The myth of the black male's racially determined, inherent physical and athletic superiority over the white male, rivals the myth of black sexual superiority in antiquity."<ref>{{cite book |last1=Edwards |first1=Harry |author-link1=Harry Edwards (sociologist) |editor1-first=Eric |editor1-last=Dunning |editor1-link=Eric Dunning |editor2-first=Dominic |editor2-last= Malcom |title=Sport |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z_4m0FbGbxcC |access-date=April 4, 2011 |volume=3 (Sport and Power Relations) |year=2003 |orig-year=2003 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-26292-7 |pages=5–18 |chapter=The Sources of the Black Athlete's Superiority |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z_4m0FbGbxcC&pg=PA5 }}</ref> Later in 2003, the JBHE Foundation published an article in ''The Journal of Blacks in Higher Education'', where they pushed back against this idea of a "black gene" leading to black superiority in athletics, a concept referred to here as "Racist Theory". The JBHE contended that "If there is a 'black gene' that leads to athletic prowess, why then do African Americans, 90 percent of whom have at least one white ancestor, outperform blacks from African nations in every sport except long distance running?"<ref name="dx.doi.org"/>

The idea among Chinese people that "genetic differences" cause Asian athletes to be "slower at sprinting" than their American, African or European rivals is "widely accepted". The ''[[People's Daily]]'', a Chinese newspaper, wrote that Chinese are "suited" to sports that draw upon "agility and technique", such as [[table tennis]], [[badminton]], [[Diving (sport)|diving]], and [[gymnastics]]. The newspaper said that Chinese people have "congenital shortcomings" and "genetic differences" that meant that they are disadvantaged at "purely athletic events" when competing against "black and white athletes". The success of [[Hurdling|hurdler]] [[Liu Xiang (hurdler)|Liu Xiang]] was explained by the hurdles event requiring technique which fit with the [[stereotype]] that Chinese are disciplined and intelligent.<ref name="Yardley" /> However, the recent successes of Chinese lightweight and middleweight weightlifters contradicts conventional belief, as [[Olympic weightlifting|weightlifting]] is one of the sports that demonstrates raw strength and explosive power best. Chinese and Korean professional weightlifters are especially overrepresented in [[olympic weightlifting]], dominating international competitions such as weightlifting at the [[Summer Olympic Games|Summer Olympics]] and the [[International Weightlifting Federation]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=China's Dominance {{!}} A Study in Sport: Olympic Weightlifting|url=https://sites.psu.edu/oly85/2016/09/23/chinas-dominance/|access-date=2020-09-17|website=sites.psu.edu}}</ref>{{Better source needed|reason=NYT article does not give any source to the People's Daily article.|date=April 2023}}

Li Aidong, a researcher with the China Institute of Sports Science, said that sports coaches believed that Chinese athletes could have success in [[long jumping]], [[high jumping]] and [[race walking]]. However, Li doubted that Chinese could compete in "pure [[sprint (running)|sprinting]]", although there did not exist any "credible scientific studies" which supported the idea that "Asians" were disadvantaged in "sprinting".<ref name="Yardley">Yardley, J.

== Explanations for participation and performance disparities ==

=== Physiological factors ===
{{Expand section|discussion of any actual evidence or scientific research testing this idea|date=February 2023}}
A 1994 examination of 32 English sport/exercise science textbooks found that seven suggested that there are biophysical differences due to race that might explain differences in sports performance, one expressed caution with the idea, and the other 24 did not mention the issue.<ref>[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb6401/is_n1_v17/ai_n28638110/ "The presentation of human biological diversity in sport and exercise science textbooks: the example of "race.""], Christopher J.

=== Socioeconomic factors ===
In ''Stuck in the Shallow End: Education, Race, and Computing'', [[UCLA]] researcher Jane Margolis outlines the history of segregation in swimming in the United States to show how people of colour have been affected up to the present day by inadequate access to swimming facilities and [[Swimming lessons|lessons]].<ref name="Margolis">{{cite book |last1=Margolis |first1=Jane |title=Stuck in the Shallow End: Education, Race, and Computing |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WOI9rGJSFCcC |access-date=April 4, 2011 |year=2008 |publisher=MIT Press Books |isbn=978-0-262-13504-7 |pages=17–26 |chapter=An Unlikely Metaphor: The Color Line in Swimming and Computer Science |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WOI9rGJSFCcC&pg=PA17 }}</ref> Margolis asserts that physiological differences between ethnic groups are relatively minor and says: "In most cases of segregation, stereotypes and belief systems about different ethnic gender groups' genetic make-up and physical abilities (and inabilities) emerge to rationalize unequal access and resulting disparities."<ref name="Margolis" /> According to Margolis, views regarding "buoyancy problems" of [[African Americans]] are merely part of [[folklore]] which have been passed down from generation to generation.<ref name="Margolis" />  Joan Ferrante, a professor of sociology at [[Northern Kentucky University]], suggests that geographic location, financial resources, and the influence of parents, peers, and role models are involved in channeling individuals of certain races towards particular sports and away from others.<ref name="Ferrante">{{cite book |last1=Ferrante |first1=Joan |author-link1=Joan Ferrante |title=Seeing Sociology:An Introduction |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0vEbS8oBYSQC |year=2011 |publisher=Cengage Learning |isbn=978-0-495-60485-3 |pages=284–285 |chapter=Race and ethnicity: Flaws in Racist Arguments |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0vEbS8oBYSQC&q=sport&pg=PA284 }}</ref>

=== Haplogroup inheritance ===
Elite athletic capacity has also been correlated with differing patterns of haplogroup inheritance. Moran et al. (2004) observed that among Y-DNA (paternal) clades borne by elite endurance athletes in Ethiopia, the [[Haplogroup E-P2|E*]], [[Haplogroup E-P2|E3*]], [[Haplogroup K (Y-DNA)|K*(xP)]],<ref name="Moran-a">{{cite journal|last=Moran |first=Colin N.|display-authors=etal|title=Y chromosome haplogroups of elite Ethiopian endurance runners|journal=Human Genetics|date=2004|volume=115|issue=6|pages=492–7|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/8214295|access-date=6 February 2017|doi=10.1007/s00439-004-1202-y|pmid=15503146|s2cid=13960753}}</ref> and [[Haplogroup J (Y-DNA)|J*(xJ2)]]<ref>{{cite journal|last=Moran|first=Colin N.|display-authors=etal|title=Y chromosome haplogroups of elite Ethiopian endurance runners|journal=Human Genetics|date=2004|volume=115|issue=6|page=494 (Fig. 1)|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/8214295|access-date=6 February 2017|doi=10.1007/s00439-004-1202-y|pmid=15503146|s2cid=13960753}}</ref> are positively correlated with elite athletic endurance performance, whereas the haplogroup [[Haplogroup E-M215 (Y-DNA)|E3b1]] is significantly less frequent among the elite endurance athletes.<ref name="Moran-a"/>

Citing haplogroup data from various previous studies, Ahmetov and Fedotovskaya (2012) report that the [[Human mitochondrial DNA haplogroup|mtDNA]] (maternal) haplogroups [[Haplogroup I (mtDNA)|I]], [[Haplogroup H (mtDNA)|H]], [[Haplogroup L0 (mtDNA)|L0]], [[Haplogroup M (mtDNA)|M*]], [[Haplogroup G (mtDNA)|G1]], [[Haplogroup N (mtDNA)|N9]], and [[Haplogroup V (mtDNA)|V]] have been positively correlated with elite athletic endurance performance, whereas the mtDNA haplogroups [[Haplogroup L3 (mtDNA)|L3*]], [[Haplogroup B (mtDNA)|B]], [[Haplogroup K (mtDNA)|K]], [[Haplogroup J (mtDNA)|J2]], and [[Haplogroup T (mtDNA)|T]] are negatively correlated with athletic endurance performance.

== Racial prejudices, discrimination, segregation, and integration ==
{{Globalize|section|USA|2name=the United States|date=September 2016}}

The [[baseball color line]], which included separate [[Negro league baseball]], was one example of [[racial segregation in the United States]].

In the United States, a study found that a form of racial discrimination exists in NBA basketball, as white players received higher salaries than do blacks related to actual performance. <!--When?  How many?  Criteria?--> Funk says this may be due to viewer discrimination. Viewership increases when there is greater participation by white players, which means higher advertising incomes. This explains much of the salary gap.<ref name=Funk2001>{{cite journal

Researchers have looked at other evidence for sports consumer discrimination. One method is comparing the price of sports memorabilia, such as baseball cards. Another is looking at fan voting for all-star teams. Still another is looking at willingness to attend sporting events. The evidence is mixed, with some studies finding bias against blacks and others not. A bias, if it exists, may be diminishing and possibly disappearing, according to a study on fan voting for baseball all-star teams.<ref name=Funk2001 />

=== Major League Baseball ===
{{Main|Baseball color line}}

[[Jackie Robinson]] was the first African American to play a major league game on April 15, 1947. Jackie loved the sport of baseball but that wasn't his only goal to make the majors. He wanted to make a way for more African Americans to join the league. However, with struggles of people being racist in the stands, players spouting off racial slang words to other players or fans, etc. Jackie wasn't discouraged to the hate as he was not only one of the best African Americans to play the game but one of the best in the history of baseball.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.history.com/news/jackie-robinson-color-barrier-baseball|title=Jackie Robinson's Battles for Equality On and Off the Baseball Field|last=Stezano|first=Martin|website=HISTORY|date=16 April 2019 |language=en|access-date=2019-12-05}}</ref>

The under-representation of Blacks in U.S. baseball ended during the early years of the [[civil rights movement]]. The representation of different races in Major League Baseball has been increasing since 1947 according to Mark Armour and Daniel R Levitt of the Society for American Baseball Research. According to their research, African American representation reached its peak in 1984 when it reached 18.4%. However, the African American representation has been steadily decreasing since that point. As of 2016, the African American representation was down to 6.7%.

According to Armour and Levitt, the Latino representation has been steadily increasing since 1947. That year, the representation was only at 0.7%. Since that time, the Latino representation in baseball has increased substantially. As of 2016, the Latino representation was at 27.4%.

Asian American representation in baseball has been much less abundant throughout the game's history according to Armour and Levitt. Their representation in the Major League did not get over 1% until 1999 when their representation was at 1.2%. While the representation is increasing, it is doing so significantly slower than the other races. As of 2016 Asian American representation was only at 2.1%, a small increase from 1999.

According to Armour and Levitt, Whites make up the largest portion of the different races represented in the Major League. However, their representation has been steadily declining as the African American, Asian, and Latino representation has been steadily on the rise. The Society for American Baseball research shows that white representation was at 98.3% in 1947. Since then, representation has decreased to 63.7% in 2016.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Dettman|first=David|date=2017-03-20|title=SABR's Guide to Doing Baseball Research |url=http://sabr.org/how-to |journal=Reference Reviews|volume=31|issue=3|pages=28|doi=10.1108/rr-10-2016-0248|issn=0950-4125}}</ref>

=== National Basketball Association ===
{{Main|Race and ethnicity in the NBA}}
Although [[Japanese-American]] [[Wataru Misaka]] broke the [[National Basketball Association]]'s color barrier in the 1947–48 season when he played for the [[New York Knicks]], 1950 is recognized as the year the NBA integrated. That year [[African-American]] players joined several teams; they included [[Chuck Cooper (basketball)|Chuck Cooper]] with the [[Boston Celtics]], [[Nathaniel "Sweetwater" Clifton|Nat "Sweetwater" Clifton]] with the [[New York Knicks]], and [[Earl Lloyd]] with the [[Washington Bullets]].

In another example from an interview with [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] Hall of Famer [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]] he states "For people of color, professional sports has always been a mirror of America's attitude toward race: as long as Black players were [[Baseball color line|restricted from taking the field]], then the rest of Black Americans would never truly be considered equal, meaning they would not be given equal educational or employment opportunities."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/aug/28/notes-from-an-ungrateful-athlete-why-race-and-sports-matter-in-america|title=Kareem Abdul-Jabbar: what sports have taught me about race in America|last=Abdul-Jabbar|first=Kareem|date=2018-08-28|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-12-03|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> Jabbar played in the NBA for 20 seasons dating back to 1969.

=== National Football League ===
{{see also|Black players in American professional football|Racial issues faced by black quarterbacks}}
Black players participated in the [[National Football League]] from its inception in 1920; however, there were no African-American players from 1933 to 1946. There is a great deal of speculation as to why this "gentleman's agreement", as it came to be called, was implemented during this era. Some argue that it was purely because of the Great Depression. Jobs were difficult to come by, and thus race relations became increasingly strained as African-Americans, and other minorities, became perceived as "threats". Finally, in 1946, the Los Angeles Rams broke this unofficial "agreement" and drafted Kenny Washington along with Woody Strode in the same year. The final NFL team to break this agreement was the Washington Redskins, who signed Bobby Mitchell in 1962.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Media Industries and Sport Scandals: Deadspin, Sports Illustrated, ESPN, and the Manti Te'o Hoax|last1=Burroughs|first1=Benjamin|last2=Vogan|first2=Travis|date=2015|publisher=Human Kinetics|isbn=978-1-5264-3812-6|location=London|doi = 10.4135/9781526438126}}</ref>

=== National Hockey League ===
{{Main|Race and ethnicity in the NHL}}
On November 16, 1926, Native American [[Taffy Abel]] joined the New York Rangers, breaking the NHL color barrier and making history as the first ever Native American to play in the [[National Hockey League]] since its founding in 1917. On January 18, 1958, [[Willie O'Ree]] joined the Boston Bruins in a game against the Montreal Canadiens,  making history as the first ever black person to play in the [[National Hockey League]]. <ref>{{Cite web|title=Hockey is for Everyone - Black Players|url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/page.htm?id=51822|access-date=2021-02-22|website=www.nhl.com|language=en}}</ref> Some 16 years later, [[Mike Marson]] became the second black player to join the league with his expansion to the Washington Capitals.<ref name=":4">{{Cite web|date=2021-02-19|title=Black History Month: Colored Hockey League Was First Organized League|url=https://thehockeywriters.com/colored-hockey-league-black-history-month/|access-date=2021-02-22|website=The Hockey Writers|language=en-us}}</ref> Decades later, a 2020 analysis revealed that [[Person of color|people of color]] still comprise less than 5% of players in the National Hockey League and that out of 377 head coaches hired over 102 years, only one has been black.<ref name=":3" />

Though black people are evidently under-represented in the National Hockey League, this is not at all reflective of their involvement in the sport and its development. In 1895–22 years before the establishment of the National Hockey League—the [[Colored Hockey League]] took form in Nova Scotia, Canada.<ref name=":5">{{Cite web|title=IIHF - Celebrating the Colored Hockey League|url=https://www.iihf.com/en/news/19969/celebrating-the-colored-hockey-league|access-date=2021-02-22|website=IIHF International Ice Hockey Federation|language=en}}</ref> This was hockey's first ever organized league, and at its peak contained hundreds of players throughout more than a dozen teams.<ref name=":4" /><ref>{{Cite web|title=Color of Hockey: Canada Post stamp celebrates Black History Month|url=https://www.nhl.com/news/canada-post-honors-maritimes-colored-hockey-championship/c-314288360|access-date=2021-02-22|website=NHL.com|language=en-US}}</ref> The season ran from late January to early March as they were only allowed access to the ice rinks when the white-only leagues finished their seasons, leaving the Colored Hockey League with the worst of the ice conditions and subsequently with a much shorter season.<ref name=":5" /> Political and racial tensions forced the league to disintegrate in 1905 as they were no longer allowed to use arenas at all, regardless of the time of year. In 1921, the league re-formed on a smaller scale with just three teams but struggled to gain and keep traction. By the mid-1930s, the National Hockey League had become hugely popular while the Colored Hockey League had disappeared altogether.

Despite the many barriers imposed on the Colored Hockey League, they were reportedly just as competitive as the white-only leagues while demonstrating a faster and more aggressive style of play and making revolutionary contributions to the sport.<ref name=":5" /> The illustrious [[slapshot]], for example, was invented by Colored Hockey League star Eddie Martin and later popularized by white players in the National Hockey League. Additionally, Henry "Braces" Franklyn was the first goalie to go down on to the ice to make saves; this 'butterfly style' was also popularized many years later by white players and remains a staple of the modern game.<ref name=":4" />

=== Professional Golfers Association ===
In 1961, the "Caucasians only" clause was struck from the [[Professional Golfers' Association of America]] constitution.

Throughout the game's history, golf has not included many African-American players, and they were often denied the opportunity to golf. However, many found a way to play the game anyway. According to an article by the African-American Registry titled African-Americans and Golf, a Brief History, "the Professional Golf Association of America (PGA) fought hard and until 1961, successfully maintained its all-white status. Black golfers (then) created their own organization of touring professionals."<ref name="1945- 2009">{{Cite book|title=African American history : an introduction|last=Turner-Sadler|first=Joanne|date=2009|publisher=Peter Lang|isbn=978-1-4331-0743-6|edition= Rev.|location=New York|oclc=422755031}}</ref>

Tiger Woods has had a major impact on the game of golf, especially among minorities. The article, African-Americans and Golf, a Brief History, states "With the ascent of Tiger Woods and his golf game comes an increased interest and participation from young minorities in the game. He himself envisions this impacting in the next ten years as they come of age and develop physically as well." Woods hopes minority participation will continue to increase in the future.<ref name="1945- 2009"/>

The research surrounding descriptions employed about White and Black athletes in the media and how the stereotypes of Black athletes has affected Tiger Woods in a majority white sport, because Tiger Woods was the only Black golfer on the PGA tour, he received different comments related to Black stereotypes that the other golfers on the tour did not.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Billings|first=Andrew C.|date=January 2003|title=Portraying Tiger Woods: Characterizations of a 'Black' Athlete in a 'White' Sport.|journal=Howard Journal of Communications|volume=14|pages=29–37|doi=10.1080/10646170304274|s2cid=145692385}}</ref>

African American participation in golf has been increasing. In a journal titled African American Culture and Physical Skill Development Programs: The Effect on Golf after Tiger Woods, it says "Smith (1997) reported data from a National Golf Foundation (NDF) study in the United States indicating there are 676,000 African-American golfers (2.7% of the 24.7 million golfers)."<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Roberson|first=Venita|date=July 2003|title=African American Culture and Physical Skill Development Programs|journal=Journal of Black Studies|volume=33|issue=6|pages=801–816|doi=10.1177/0021934703033006005|s2cid=142984352|issn=0021-9347}}</ref>

As African-American participation increased, Asian participation in professional golf has also increased. According to an article by Golfweek titled Record Number of Asian Golfers Compete for Masters Glory, there were 10 golfers which was a tournament record.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Romine|first=Brentley|date=April 2018|title=Record Number of Asian Golfers Compete for Masters Glory|url=https://golfweek.usatoday.com/2018/04/05/record-number-of-asian-golfers-compete-for-masters-glory/|journal=Golfweek}}</ref>

According to the article Where are all the black golfers? Nearly two decades after Tiger Woods' arrival, golf still struggles to attract minorities, As of 2013 there were 25.7 million golfers: this was composed of 20.3 million whites, 3.1 million Hispanics, 1.3 million African-Americans, and 1 million Asian-Americans. The lack of diversity is still very apparent in golf today.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Rosselli |first1=Anthony |last2=Singer |first2=John N. |date=2017 |title=Challenges Faced by African American Golfers Pursuing Professional Careers |url=https://go.gale.com/ps/i.do?p=AONE&sw=w&issn=15591646&v=2.1&it=r&id=GALE%7CA518212792&sid=googleScholar&linkaccess=abs |journal=Journal of African American Studies |language=English |volume=21 |issue=4 |pages=605–621|doi=10.1007/s12111-017-9386-0 |s2cid=148862726 }}</ref>

=== Positions of power: coaching and administration ===
Referring to quarterbacks, head coaches, and athletic directors, [[Kenneth L. Shropshire]] of the [[Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania]] has described the number of African Americans in "positions of power" as "woefully low".<ref name=autogenerated3 /> In 2000, 78% of players in the NBA were Black, but only 33% of NBA officials were minorities.<ref name=autogenerated5>Duncan 2009, p. 200.</ref>  The lack of minorities in positions of leadership has been attributed to racial stereotypes as well "[[old boy network]]s" and white administrators [[business networking|networking]] within their own race.<ref name=autogenerated5 />  In 2003, the NFL implemented the [[Rooney Rule]], requiring teams searching for a new [[head coach]] to interview at least one minority candidate.<ref name=autogenerated5 />

With an inadequate number of minorities in executive positions in the NFL, the NFL decided to revise the Rooney Rule to include teams to interview minorities for general manager positions. There has been backlash on how effective this rule has been and if there needs to be more revisions to this rule. As of 2022, there are only six minority head coaches in the NFL: [[Lovie Smith]], [[Mike Tomlin]], [[Ron Rivera]], [[Robert Saleh]], [[Todd Bowles]], and [[Mike McDaniel]]. Because of racial discrimination, which AAP News & Journal defines as, "a form of social inequality that includes experiences resulting from legal and nonlegal systems of discrimination",<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Brownlow|first1=Janeese|last2=Walker|first2=Doren|last3=Settles-Reaves|first3=Beverlyn|last4=Sanders-Phillips|first4=Kathy|date=2009-11-01|title=Social Inequality and Racial Discrimination: Risk Factors for Health Disparities in Children of Color|url=https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/124/Supplement_3/S176|journal=Pediatrics|language=en|volume=124|issue=Supplement 3|pages=S176–S186|doi=10.1542/peds.2009-1100E|issn=0031-4005|pmid=19861468|doi-access=free}}</ref> it has resulted in unequal outcomes and a power struggle. A vast majority of the representation of minority coaches are held at positional or assistant coaches. With a lot of people [minorities] competing for head coaching positions with only a limited supply, it allows the very few minority head coaches to get handsomely salaries while the rest get average or low pay. Not only are finances an issue, the talent that is being presented is ultimately looked over because minorities coaches are not being hired and the NFL is meeting their status quo, of at least interviewing minorities for head coaching and general manager positions.

The power dynamics between the owners and players in the NFL has created racial inequality between the two groups. 30 owners are white while only two owners are of color (one is from Pakistan and one is Asian American). Richard Roth, sports attorney who has represented Peyton Manning, claimed, "22 of the teams in the NFL have been owned by the same person or family for at least 20 years".<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://money.cnn.com/2018/05/18/news/nfl-nba-mlb-owners-diversity/index.html|title=These are the only two owners of color in the NFL|last=Garcia|first=Ahiza|date=2018-05-18|website=CNNMoney|access-date=2019-04-08}}</ref> Dr. Richard Lapchick, director of the Institute for Diversity and Ethics in Sports, claimed, "Who owners invite into their fraternity-and its overwhelmingly a fraternity-is self-selective".<ref name=":0" /> Owners of teams must be very wealthy as teams "Cost upwards of $1B".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/05/nfl-owners-teams-football.html|title=NFL team ownership explained|last=Geeter|first=Darren|date=2018-10-07|website=www.cnbc.com|access-date=2019-04-08}}</ref> Due to [[wealth inequality in the United States]], there are few black billionaires who could be potential candidates.

Many of the racial problems shown in sports are present because of the lack of diversity in ownership. The predominant presence of white male owners in sports drives a wedge between members of the organization. The narrative portrayed by ownership in sports paints the same picture of slave and owner from 400 years ago. NBA player [[Draymond Green]] ignited debates on the relationship between team ownership and players. In 2017, Green stated that the NBA should really consider the term "owner" and its usage dating back to chattel slavery, considering the majority of NBA players are black and nearly all team ownership is white.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/16/sports/basketball/slavery-anniversary-basketball-owners.html|title=Is Slavery's Legacy in the Power Dynamics of Sports?|last=Streeter|first=Kurt|date=2019-08-16|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-11-28|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> This has been a fact virtually the entire history of sports organizations.

Aside from a lack of black owners, owners make hundreds of times what the players make. This is similar to the NFL disparity between owners and the players. According to a report by the Green Bay Packers, the NFL earned $7,808,000 from TV deals, and split it among its 32 teams evenly. This means that each NFL owner "made $244m last year in 2016".<ref name=":1" /> By contrast, the "average NFL player made $2.1m in 2015". The owners of these teams are making hundreds of times what the players are. This is similar to the difference in pay between CEOs and average workers of corporations. Professor Pfeffer, a social inequality professor at the University of Michigan, claimed, "CEOs make more than 350 times what the average worker makes".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/kurtbadenhausen/2016/12/15/average-player-salaries-in-major-american-sports-leagues/|title=The Average Player Salary And Highest-Paid In NBA, MLB, NHL, NFL And MLS|last=Badenhausen|first=Kurt|website=Forbes|language=en|access-date=2019-04-08}}</ref> The work of the owners is not hundreds of times more valuable than that of the players. However, it is the power dynamics and politics of the league structure that allow owners to make so much more.

Similar to the discrepancy between participation and leadership of blacks in American professional sports leagues, NCAA sports also have had a low percentage of administrators and coaches relative to the number of athletes. For example, during the 2005–2006 academic year, high revenue NCAA sports (basketball and football) had 51 percent black student athletes, whereas only 17 percent of head coaches in the same high revenue sports were black<ref>{{cite book|last=Hawkins|first=Billy|title=The New Plantation: Black Athletes, College Sports, and Predominantly White NCAA Institutions|url=https://archive.org/details/newplantationbla00hawk|url-access=limited|year=2010|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/newplantationbla00hawk/page/n155 141]–42|isbn=9780230615175}}</ref> Also, in the same 2005–2006 year, only 5.5 percent of athletic directors at Division I "PWIs" (Primarily White Institutions), were black.<ref name="Hawkins 2010 141">{{cite book|last=Hawkins|first=Billy|title=The New Plantation: Black Athletes, College Sports, and Predominantly White NCAA Institutions|url=https://archive.org/details/newplantationbla00hawk|url-access=limited|year=2010|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/newplantationbla00hawk/page/n155 141]|isbn=9780230615175}}</ref> Terry Bowden, a notable white Division I football coach, suggests that the reason many university presidents will not hire black coaches is "because they are worried about how alumni and donors will react."<ref name="Hawkins 2010 141" /> Bowden also refers to the "untapped talent"<ref name="Hawkins 2010" /> existing within the ranks of assistant coaches in Division I football.

In terms of administrative positions, they have been concentrated largely in the hands of whites.

The use of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] names and imagery for [[mascot|sport mascots]] or in franchise memorabilia is an issue of ongoing discussion and controversy in American sports, as some Native American representatives have objected to such use without explicit negotiation and permission.<ref>Duncan 2009, p. 202.</ref>

=== Controversy within The Atlanta Hawks ===
The Atlanta Hawks has had multiple cases where racial discrimination has become an issue with the organization. In 2012 Bruce Levenson, majority ownership holder in the Atlanta Hawks NBA franchise, gave an evaluation in an email to other administration on the progress of the Atlanta Hawks game operations. In the email, Levenson states originally that game operations was not a concern but is now due to the lack of a season ticket base caused by the demographics of attendants at games and those involved with game operations. Levenson claims he was told because white males around 35–55 years of age and corporations are not the target of all aspects of game operations season tickets would not sell. When pressed for answers no one would not give Levenson any further assistance figuring out the issue. It was then he noticed 70% black attendees at games, black cheerleaders at the games, the music was hip-hop, customers at the arena bars were 90% black, few fathers and sons, and the concerts after games were either hip-hop or gospel.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Gill Jr|first1=Emmett L. |last2=Christensen|first2=M.

Despite the email being sent to staff in 2012 it was not revealed until in an investigation of a second incident that included racist remarks in regards to Luol Deng (a British NBA player born in what is now [[South Sudan]]). In 2014 Danny Ferry was the President of the Atlanta Hawks franchise. In a scouting report on Luol Deng he stated that Deng displayed good traits on the outside but despite seems like a good person he's an African. Ferry goes on to compare Deng to "African store front that looks great but there's black market section in the back".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sbnation.com/2014/9/12/6141197/luol-deng-african-hawks-danny-ferry-racist|title='African' comment was used in Deng scouting report|last=Prada|first=Mike|date=2014-09-12|website=SBNation.com|language=en|access-date=2019-11-24}}</ref>

These problematic statements by both Danny Ferry and Bruce Levenson became the driving force behind the sell of the Atlanta Hawks.The Atlanta Hawks would be bought for approximately $730 – 850 million by Tony Ressler. Due to being overshadowed by a racial incident between Donald Sterling and the Los Angeles Clippers, the Hawks organization did not receive much publicity.

=== Promoting racial harmony and breaking stereotypes ===
Racial differences in the NFL are also evident between player positions. According to an Undefeated article, all positions have remained strongly overrepresented by African American players in the period between 1999 and 2014, with African Americans outnumbering white Americans in several positions. However, this effect has been less pronounced for the center and quarterback positions: in 1999, the percentage of white players in the center position was 75% compared to 20% for African Americans, while the percentage of white players in the quarterback position was 81% compared to 18% for African American;<ref name="Reid">{{Cite web|url=https://andscape.com/features/the-nfls-racial-divide/|title=The NFL's racial divide|last=Reid|first=Jason|date=2017-04-26|website=[[Andscape]]|language=en-US|access-date=2019-04-08}}</ref> though white Americans outnumbered African Americans in these positions, the percentages nonetheless showed significant overrepresentation of African Americans (~13% of the total population of the US) among both center and quarterback players compared to white Americans (~82% of the total population).<ref>{{cite web |title=Population Profile of the United States (US Census Bureau) |url=https://www.census.gov/prod/2001pubs/p23-205.pdf |access-date=11 March 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210216104820/https://www.census.gov/prod/2001pubs/p23-205.pdf |archive-date=16 February 2021 |page=12}}</ref> In 2014, the center position showed more proportionate representation―with 81% being white and 16% African American―while the number of white quarterback players had decreased slightly within the same time frame (coinciding with a 1% increase in black quarterbacks).<ref name="Reid"/> A study by the University of Colorado examining racial stereotypes towards NFL quarterbacks found that "black participants stereotyped both races more strongly...suggesting that black players may not believe they are cut out to be a professional quarterback".<ref name=":03">{{Cite web|url=https://www.colorado.edu/today/2017/08/21/racial-stereotypes-influence-perception-nfl-quarterbacks|title=Racial stereotypes influence perception of NFL quarterbacks|date=2017-08-21|website=CU Boulder Today|language=en|access-date=2019-04-08}}</ref> The study goes on to say that, "the terms physical strength and natural ability were more associated with the black quarterbacks while leadership and intelligence was more associated with white quarterbacks".<ref name=":03" /> These biases are thought to reflect how football players are viewed by the general populace, and ostensibly have an impact on perceptions among adolescents as well.

According to William Jeynes, a professor of education at [[California State University, Long Beach]], the gathering at the [[Thanksgiving (United States)|first Thanksgiving in the United States]] was an attempt to create racial harmony through games and sporting contests that included [[running]], [[shooting]] and [[wrestling]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Jeynes |first1=William |title=American Educational History: School, Society, and the Common Good |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FL2WYw0ve-0C |access-date=April 13, 2011 |year=2007 |publisher=Sage Publications |isbn=978-1-4129-1421-5 |page=9 |chapter=The Colonial Experience, 1607–1776: Puritans' and Pilgrims' Relationship with Native Americans |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FL2WYw0ve-0C&pg=PA9 }}</ref> [[Huping Ling]], a professor of history at [[Truman State University]], has asserted that the participation of Chinese students in sports helped break local stereotypes in the St. Louis area during the 1920s.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ling |first1=Huping |author-link1=Huping Ling |title=Chinese St. Louis: From Enclave to Cultural Community |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d48Fos9tv58C |year=2004 |publisher=Temple University Press |isbn=978-1-59213-039-9 |page=112 |chapter=Dwindling "Hop Alley"; 1920s – 1966 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d48Fos9tv58C&pg=PA112 }}</ref> This history of racial tension in the competition between whites and minority groups shows an attempt to prove the humanity, equality, and even occasionally their superiority on the playing field. By doing so, groups of minorities hoped that sports would serve as a source for racial pride that would eventually lead to upward social mobility. However, as early as 1984, criticism has been levied against these ideas. Sports sociologist Harry Edwards openly criticized African Americans as being "co-conspirators" in their own children's exploitation by the white dominated sports establishment. Edwards asserted that stereotypes such as the “dumb jocks” were not born but rather socially created and fuelled by low expectations, their communities, and educational institutions that overly encourage athletic persists.<ref>https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/10.5323/jafriamerhist.96.4.0441.pdf?refreqid=excelsior%3A52465c8a169dfd46ea447529a629809e&ab_segments=&origin=&initiator=&acceptTC=1</ref> Despite the perception of a white dominated sports establishment, research has shown that there is greater emphasis on sports as a potential career path in the African American community compared to the White community.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Beamon|first=Krystal K.|date=2009-08-27|title=Are Sports Overemphasized in the Socialization Process of African American Males?

Many people believe Kaepernick is a hero for raising awareness for important social issues. However, his actions caused a massive backlash by fans and the media who decried him for acting anti American and disrespecting American troops. Furthermore, players from other teams began to kneel instead of stand with the national anthem. When questioned by the media, he claimed, "I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color." He continued, "If they take football away, my endorsements from me, I know that I stood up for what is right."<ref name=":2" /> According to NFL policy, "There is no rule saying players must stand during the national anthem".<ref>{{Cite web|last=Geeter|first=Darren|date=2018-10-07|title=NFL team ownership explained|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/05/nfl-owners-teams-football.html|access-date=2019-04-08|website=www.cnbc.com}}</ref>

== Issues in sports commentating ==
Racial remarks have been made about athletes of color throughout history. Radio host Don Imus described the Rutgers University women's basketball team as "nappy-headed hos" on his radio program "Imus in the Morning" in 2007. Later on he proclaimed that the match-up between Rutgers and their opponents looked like a showdown of the "jigaboos versus the wannabes."<ref>{{cite news |last1=Trock |first1=Gary |title=Don Imus Is Dead, Twitter Hasn't Forgotten 'Nappy Headed Hos' Controversy |url=https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/don-imus-dead-twitter-hasnt-004615072.html |work=Yahoo! |date=27 December 2019 }}</ref>

In 1988 sports commentator [[Jimmy Snyder (sports commentator)|Jimmy "the Greek" Snyder]]<ref name=":7">{{Cite web|last=Lawrence|first=Andrew|date=2018-10-02|title=How the 'natural talent' myth is used as a weapon against black athletes|url=http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/oct/02/athletes-racism-language-sports-cam-newton|access-date=2021-05-03|website=The Guardian|language=en}}</ref> proclaimed his theory on why Black Americans are more athletic than White Americans: "The black is a better athlete to begin with because he's been bred to be that way, because of his high thighs and big thighs that goes up into his back, and they can jump higher and run faster because of their bigger thighs and he's bred to be the better athlete because this goes back all the way to the Civil War when during the slave trade … the slave owner would breed his big black to his big woman so that he could have a big black kid …"

Snyder would later express regret for his comments shortly after they aired, telling ''[[The Washington Post]]'' that "I thought I was being instructive, when in fact, I was destructive".<ref name=":7" />

Snyder was later fired by CBS.{{citation needed|date=May 2021}}

== Portrayals in film ==
While there are discrepancies in "based on a true story" sports movies, the movies are still representing the harsh realities of race and sports well. The US-set films ''[[Hoosiers (film)|Hoosiers]]'' and ''[[Rudy (film)|Rudy]]'' have been described as memorializing the "golden age of sports" as a time of white prevalence and dominance,<ref>King 2006, p.189</ref> while ''[[Glory Road (film)|Glory Road]]'' showed [[Don Haskins|a white coach]] [[1965–66 Texas Western Miners basketball team|helping to dissolve]] the color barrier in college basketball.

Another movie that received critical acclaim was ''42''. This movie was the Jackie Robinson story, a young man who was the first black player in the MLB. This movie focused on the journey Robinson took throughout his first year in the major leagues, going through the ups and downs. There were some moments that critics felt like producers could have given more depth to different characters, but overall the film represented that time in America and sports well.<ref>{{Cite web |last1=McCarthy |first1=Todd |date=2013-04-09 |title=42: Film Review |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/42-film-review-434880/ |access-date=2022-10-26 |website=The Hollywood Reporter |language=en-US}}</ref>

''[[Invictus (film)|Invictus]]'' deals with the subject of the [[1995 Rugby World Cup]] in post-apartheid South Africa.

Some movies about black athletes don't focus completely on the aspect of race. The 2001 movie ''Ali'', a film about great boxer Muhammed Ali, was another story about the journey through his life, but only briefly focused on racial aspects. There were mentions of some of his career being after the assassinations of Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr, but most of the film reflected on Ali and his personal journey that had little to do with the color of his skin.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Mitchell |first=Elvis |date=2001-12-25 |title=FILM REVIEW; Master of the Boast, King of the Ring, Vision of the Future |language=en-US |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/25/movies/film-review-master-of-the-boast-king-of-the-ring-vision-of-the-future.html |access-date=2022-10-26 |issn=0362-4331}}</ref> In 2022 a film was announced about the [[1956 Sugar Bowl]], which included the first black player to play in a college bowl game in the deep south.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Milliken |first1=Paul |title=Football pioneer reflects on 1956 Sugar Bowl controversy |url=https://www.fox5atlanta.com/news/football-pioneer-reflects-on-1956-sugar-bowl-controversy |website=FOX 5 Atlanta |date=5 July 2022}}</ref>

In the recent years, the influence of [[Polynesians|Polynesian]] players on the NRL [[National Rugby League]] has grown, with figures from the 2011 season showing that 35% of NRL players and over 45% of NRL Under-20s players are of Polynesian background. (By way of comparison, less than 3% of the Australian population identified themselves as Polynesian in the 2021 Australian census).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/rugby-league/league-news/crunch-time-for-juniors-weighty-issue-20110319-1c1ba.html |title=Crunch time for juniors' weighty issue |publisher=Smh.com.au |access-date=1 July 2013}}</ref> This increase in Polynesian players has been blamed for the decline of Indigenous players, dropping from 21% in the 1990s to 11% for the 2009 season.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/lhqnews/broy-mastersb/2009/04/23/1240079798304.html |title=League's Polynesian powerplay muscles in on indigenous numbers – LHQNews |publisher=Smh.com.au |date= 24 April 2009|access-date=1 July 2013}}</ref>

In [[South Africa]], black representation on the cricket and rugby [[national sports team]]s is ensured via the introduction of quotas.<ref>Giulianotti 2005, p.69.</ref>

== United States ==
Discussions of race and sports in the United States, where the two subjects have always been intertwined in [[American history]], have focused to a great extent on African Americans.<ref name=autogenerated1>Gems 2009, p. 238.</ref> Depending on the type of sport and performance level, African Americans are reported to be over- or under-represented.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> African Americans compose the highest percentage of the minority groups active at the professional level, but are among those who show the lowest participation overall.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> And though the list of African Americans in professional sports remains high, it only represents a small fraction of aspiring black athletes. The Journal of African American History’s (JAAH) Special Issue on African American participation in sports in the 19th and 20th centuries demonstrates that African Americans have often used sports to challenge the social subjugation of their communities and stigma of the society. <ref>https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/10.5323/jafriamerhist.96.4.0441.pdf?refreqid=excelsior%3A52465c8a169dfd46ea447529a629809e&ab_segments=&origin=&initiator=&acceptTC=1</ref>

In 2013, while 2.8% of full-time degree-pursuing undergraduates were black men, the group comprised 57% of college football teams,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://time.com/4110443/college-football-race-problem/ |title=College Football big problem with race |access-date=November 13, 2016 |author=Diane Roberts |date=November 12, 2015 |publisher=Time magazine}}</ref> and 64% of men's basketball players, according to Shaun R.

A 2001 study indicated that black high school students play harder than white students, because the former were more likely to perceive sports as a venue to success. The study denies that racial characteristics, per se, are a factor in success in sports.<ref name=smith>{{Cite web |url=http://www.science.smith.edu/exer_sci/ESS200/Raceh/Raceh.htm |title=Race and sport |access-date=November 13, 2016|publisher=Smith College}}</ref> Despite such evidence, pseudo-scientific conceptions of race continue to play a role in the way many in the United States understand African-American contributions to sports.<ref>https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/10.5323/jafriamerhist.96.4.0441.pdf?refreqid=excelsior%3A52465c8a169dfd46ea447529a629809e&ab_segments=&origin=&initiator=&acceptTC=1</ref>


For all races and sports, from 3.3% (basketball) to 11.3% (ice hockey) are successful in making the transition from high school varsity to an NCAA team.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.ncaa.org/about/resources/research/probability-competing-beyond-high-school |title=Probability of Competing Beyond High School |access-date=November 13, 2016  |publisher=NCAA|date=2013-12-17 }}</ref> From .8% (men's ice hockey) to 9.4% (baseball) successfully transition from NCAA to professional teams.

Unlike black athletes, blacks as a group have not perceived sports as an important venue to prosperity.
There are higher participation rates by blacks as well as higher numbers of people in non-athletic endeavor, such as policy, teaching, physicians, lawyers, engineers, and architects.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.theroot.com/articles/history/2014/09/why_are_there_so_many_black_athletes/ |title=Why Are There So Many Black Athletes? |access-date=November 13, 2016 |author=Henry Louis Gates Jr. |date=September 1, 2014 |publisher=theroot.com  }}</ref>

Athletics have been increasingly subsidized by tuition. Only one in eight of the 202 [[NCAA Division I|Division I]] colleges actually netted more money than they spent on athletics between the years 2005 and 2010. At the few money making schools, [[American football|football]] and sometimes basketball sales support the school's other athletic programs. The amount spent on an athlete in one of the six highest-profile football conferences, on average, is six times more than the amount spent to educate the non-athlete. Spending per student varied from $10,012 to $19,225; cost per athlete varied from $41,796 to $163,930.<ref>{{Cite news | first=Mary Beth | last=Marklein | title=Athletics get more dollars than academics | url=http://www.floridatoday.com/usatoday/article/1837721| newspaper=[[Florida Today]] | location=[[Melbourne, Florida]] | pages= 4A | date=January 16, 2013 }}</ref><!---soft copy is missing "box" (present in hard copy) which has exact figures but otherwise supports this material--->
