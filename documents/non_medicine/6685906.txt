Poly-MVA is promoted with claims that it can treat a variety of human diseases, including [[cancer]] and [[HIV/AIDS]].<ref name=acs/> The promotional effort is supported by customer testimonials, but there is no [[evidence-based medicine|medical evidence]] that Poly-MVA confers any health benefit and some concern it may inhibit the effectiveness of mainstream cancer treatments if used at the same time.<ref name=acs/><ref name=mskcc/>
