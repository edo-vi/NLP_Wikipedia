An '''illustrated song''' is a type of [[performance art]] that combines either live or recorded music with [[Projector|projected]] images. It was a popular form of entertainment in the early 20th century in the United States.<ref name="The Sounds of Early Cinema ch. 14">{{cite book | title=That Most American of Attractions, The Illustrated Song| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wADgG_d-PSAC&pg=PA143| last=Abel| first=Richard|author2=Rick Altman| year=2001| pages=143–153| publisher=Indiana University Press| isbn=0-253-33988-X}}</ref><ref name="Ripley's retrospective on illustrated songs">{{cite journal| author=John W.

Live performers (usually both a pianist and a vocalist) and music recordings were both used by different venues ([[vaudeville]] houses first and later in [[Nickelodeon (movie theater)|nickelodeons]]) to accompany still images projected from glass [[Reversal film|slides]]. This allowed the images to be painted in color by hand.  A single song was usually accompanied by 12 to 16 different images that sequentially "illustrated" the lyrics.  Projection booths used either [[stereopticon]]s with two [[Magic lantern (projector)|projectors]] or machines that combined projection of both slides and [[film|moving pictures]].<ref name="Americanizing the Movies and Movie-Mad Audiences, 1910-1914">{{cite book | title=A "Forgotten" Part of the Program: Illustrated Songs| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AlR2kKRn11AC&q=A+%E2%80%98Forgotten%E2%80%99+Part+of+the+Program%3A+Illustrated+Songs&pg=PT145| last=Abel| first=Richard| year=2006| pages=127–134| publisher=University of California Press| isbn=978-0-520-24742-0}}</ref>  Illustrated songs often preceded [[silent film]]s and/or took place during [[Reel#Motion picture terminology|reel changes]], but some venues relied principally on illustrated songs alone.  At least ten thousand small theaters nationwide featured illustrated songs.<ref name="music video 1900 style on PBS Kids Go!">{{Cite web|url=http://pbskids.org/wayback/tech1900/music/index.html|title=Music Video 1900 Style|publisher=PBS|year=2004|access-date=2009-12-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100104220832/http://pbskids.org/wayback/tech1900/music/index.html|archive-date=2010-01-04|url-status=dead}}</ref> Illustrated songs were seen as a valuable promotional tool for marketing [[sheet music]]. Audience participation was encouraged, and repeat performances also helped encourage sheet music sales.<ref name="The Sounds of Early Cinema ch. 14" />

Several film stars began their careers as models who illustrated lyrics through a series of song slides.  These stars included [[Roscoe Arbuckle]], [[Fanny Brice]], [[Eddie Cantor]], [[George Jessel (actor)|George Jessel]], [[Alice Joyce]], [[Florence Lawrence]], and [[Norma Talmadge]].<ref name="Norma Talmadge's Debut as Slide Model">{{Cite web|url=http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~pringle/silent/ssotm/Nov97/|title=Norma Talmadge - Silent Star of November, 1997|publisher=Monash University|year=1997|author=Kally Mavromatis|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081227115123/http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~pringle/silent/ssotm/Nov97/|archivedate=2008-12-27}}</ref>
