* [[2007 New England Patriots videotaping controversy]] (2007) – the [[New England Patriots]] were disciplined for videotaping the opposing team's coach's signals.

* [[New Orleans Saints bounty scandal]] (2012) – the NFL discovered that the [[New Orleans Saints]] had operated a secret slush fund from [[2009 New Orleans Saints season|2009]] to [[2011 New Orleans Saints season|2011]] that paid "bounties" to defensive players for big plays during games, most controversially for injuring opponents. The scheme was allegedly organized by a number of players plus defensive coordinator [[Gregg Williams]], with the acquiescence of head coach [[Sean Payton]]. Shortly after the investigation came to light, Williams was accused of running similar schemes while he was defensive coordinator of the [[Tennessee Titans|Houston Oilers/Tennessee Titans]] and [[Washington Redskins]], as well as the head coach of the [[Buffalo Bills]]. The league suspended Williams indefinitely and Payton for one year and suspended the Saints' general manager and another assistant for parts of the [[2012 NFL season|2012 season]]. [[Jonathan Vilma]], a Saints player who had a major role in the scheme and reportedly offered a $10,000 bounty on [[Brett Favre]], was suspended for the entire season and three other players were suspended for parts of the season. However, in September 2012, an arbitrator overturned the suspensions of the players involved in the affair. Williams' suspension ultimately lasted one year.

After the match, they told the referee they would not play against an Azerbaijani team and later that evening left Moscow on an airplane. The [[Russian Football Union]] gave Shakhtar Donetsk a technical victory 3–0 so they could play in the half-final instead of Pyunik, but Shakhtar Donetsk declined the offer stating that "[W]e would really want to play in the half-final, but we don't want to get there by any other way then sport". Eventually, because no one could play against Neftchi in the half-final, Neftchi were right away promoted to the final, where they defeated the [[Lithuania]]n club [[FBK Kaunas|Kaunas]] 4–2.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsru.com/sport/19jan2006/scandal.html|title=Новости NEWSru.com :: Скандал на Кубке Содружества: чемпионы Армении отказались играть с азербайджанцами|work=newsru.com|date=19 January 2006}}</ref>

The NCAA announced the results of its investigation in June 2017, announcing major sanctions that included a 10-year [[show-cause penalty]] for McGee and the potential loss of the team's [[2012–13 Louisville Cardinals men's basketball team|2013 national title]].

== Gliding scandals ==

* During the 2020 [[World Gliding Championships#Women's World Gliding Championships|Women's World Gliding Championships]] at [[Keepit Dam|Lake Keepit]], [[Australia]], the home team captain Terry Cubley (Executive Officer of the [[Gliding Federation of Australia|GFA]]) was charged with unsporting behaviour for hacking the official tracking system to bypass the mandatory 15 minute delay and forward real time competitors' positions to his team, granting a tactical advantage. An investigation revealed that Matt Gage had been closely involved with the developers of the tracking system, and was aware of an undocumented back door that allowed the team captain (Terry Cubley) to bypass the 15 minute delay. This real-time information was relayed by the team captain over the radio to the Australian pilots. This was the first time in the sport's history that an entire team had been penalised for unsporting behaviour, with the Competition Director applying a penalty of 25 points per pilot per day. Controversially the pilots involved were spared disqualification only receiving a relatively trivial points reduction (compared to a competing pilot who was disqualified for infringing airspace earlier in the competition). Following a subsequent GFA investigation two of the Australian Team admitted to cheating and the GFA made a formal apology to the FAI and the wider gliding community. Terry Cubley was removed from his role as Vice President of the [[FAI Gliding Commission|IGC]], but chose to remain as Executive Officer of the GFA . The pilots involved chose to appeal against this decision, resulting in the longest and most comprehensive investigation in the FAIs history. The final judgement <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fai.org/sites/default/files/iat_wwgc2019_report_and_decision.pdf|title=FAI tribunal results|website=www.fai.org|access-date=6 December 2021}}</ref> described the actions of the pilots as ‘reprehensible’, increased the penalty to disqualification and removed their flights from the competition record. The Appeal Tribunal also recommended the FAI to take further disciplinary action against those involved. Following the Tribunals verdict Lisa Turner (the Australian pilots’ representative to the tribunal) issued a press release re-iterating their denial of cheating, accused the tribunal of bias against the Australian team and announced a further appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport [[Court of Arbitration for Sport|CAS]].
