Machine ethics (or machine morality) is the field of research concerned with designing [[Moral agency#Artificial moral agents|Artificial Moral Agents]] (AMAs), robots or artificially intelligent computers that behave morally or as though moral.<ref name="Andersonweb">{{cite web|last=Anderson|title=Machine Ethics|url=http://uhaweb.hartford.edu/anderson/MachineEthics.html|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928233656/http://uhaweb.hartford.edu/anderson/MachineEthics.html|archive-date=28 September 2011|access-date=27 June 2011}}</ref><ref name="Anderson2011">{{Cite book|title=Machine Ethics|date=July 2011|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=978-0-521-11235-2|editor1-last=Anderson|editor1-first=Michael|editor2-last=Anderson|editor2-first=Susan Leigh}}</ref><ref name="Anderson2006">{{cite journal|last1=Anderson|first1=M.|last2=Anderson|first2=S.L.|date=July 2006|title=Guest Editors' Introduction: Machine Ethics|journal=IEEE Intelligent Systems|volume=21|issue=4|pages=10–11|doi=10.1109/mis.2006.70|s2cid=9570832}}</ref><ref name="Anderson2007">{{cite journal|last1=Anderson|first1=Michael|last2=Anderson|first2=Susan Leigh|date=15 December 2007|title=Machine Ethics: Creating an Ethical Intelligent Agent|journal=AI Magazine|volume=28|issue=4|page=15|doi=10.1609/aimag.v28i4.2065|s2cid=17033332 }}</ref> To account for the nature of these agents, it has been suggested to consider certain philosophical ideas, like the standard characterizations of [[Agency (philosophy)|agency]], [[Rational agent|rational agency]], [[moral agency]], and artificial agency, which are related to the concept of AMAs.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Boyles|first1=Robert James M.|date=2017|title=Philosophical Signposts for Artificial Moral Agent Frameworks|url=https://philarchive.org/rec/BOYPSF|journal=Suri|volume=6|issue=2|pages=92–109}}</ref>

[[Isaac Asimov]] considered the issue in the 1950s in his ''[[I, Robot]]''. At the insistence of his editor [[John W. Campbell Jr.]], he proposed the [[Three Laws of Robotics]] to govern artificially intelligent systems.  Much of his work was then spent testing the boundaries of his three laws to see where they would break down, or where they would create paradoxical or unanticipated behavior. His work suggests that no set of fixed laws can sufficiently anticipate all possible circumstances.<ref name="Asimov2008">{{Cite book|last=Asimov|first=Isaac|title=I, Robot|title-link=I, Robot|publisher=Bantam|year=2008|isbn=978-0-553-38256-3|location=New York}}</ref> More recently, academics and many governments have challenged the idea that AI can itself be held accountable.<ref name="lacuna">{{cite journal|last1=Bryson|first1=Joanna|last2=Diamantis|first2=Mihailis|last3=Grant|first3=Thomas|date=September 2017|title=Of, for, and by the people: the legal lacuna of synthetic persons|journal=Artificial Intelligence and Law|volume=25|issue=3|pages=273–291|doi=10.1007/s10506-017-9214-9|ref=lacuna|doi-access=free}}</ref> A panel convened by the [[United Kingdom]] in 2010 revised Asimov's laws to clarify that AI is the responsibility either of its manufacturers, or of its owner/operator.<ref name="principles">{{cite web|date=September 2010|title=Principles of robotics|url=https://epsrc.ukri.org/research/ourportfolio/themes/engineering/activities/principlesofrobotics/|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180401004346/https://www.epsrc.ac.uk/research/ourportfolio/themes/engineering/activities/principlesofrobotics/|archive-date=1 April 2018|access-date=10 January 2019|publisher=UK's EPSRC|ref=principles}}</ref>

In 2009, during an experiment at the Laboratory of Intelligent Systems in the Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale of [[Lausanne]], Switzerland, robots that were programmed to cooperate with each other (in searching out a beneficial resource and avoiding a poisonous one) eventually learned to lie to each other in an attempt to hoard the beneficial resource.<ref>[http://www.popsci.com/scitech/article/2009-08/evolving-robots-learn-lie-hide-resources-each-other Evolving Robots Learn To Lie To Each Other] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090828105728/http://www.popsci.com/scitech/article/2009-08/evolving-robots-learn-lie-hide-resources-each-other|date=2009-08-28}}, Popular Science, August 18, 2009</ref>

Some experts and academics have questioned the use of robots for military combat, especially when such robots are given some degree of autonomous functions.<ref name="Call for debate on killer robots" /> The US Navy has funded a report which indicates that as military robots become more complex, there should be greater attention to implications of their ability to make autonomous decisions.<ref>[http://www.dailytech.com/New%20Navyfunded%20Report%20Warns%20of%20War%20Robots%20Going%20Terminator/article14298.htm Science New Navy-funded Report Warns of War Robots Going "Terminator"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090728101106/http://www.dailytech.com/New%20Navyfunded%20Report%20Warns%20of%20War%20Robots%20Going%20Terminator/article14298.htm|date=2009-07-28}}, by Jason Mick (Blog), dailytech.com, February 17, 2009.</ref><ref name="engadget.com" /> The President of the [[Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence]] has commissioned a study to look at this issue.<ref>[http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/horvitz/AAAI_Presidential_Panel_2008-2009.htm AAAI Presidential Panel on Long-Term AI Futures 2008–2009 Study] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090828214741/http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/horvitz/AAAI_Presidential_Panel_2008-2009.htm|date=2009-08-28}}, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence, Accessed 7/26/09.</ref> They point to programs like the Language Acquisition Device which can emulate human interaction.

There are discussions on creating tests to see if an AI is capable of making [[ethical decision]]s. [[Alan Winfield]] concludes that the [[Turing test]] is flawed and the requirement for an AI to pass the test is too low.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last1=Winfield|first1=A.

In 2009, academics and technical experts attended a conference organized by the [[Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence]] to discuss the potential impact of robots and computers, and the impact of the hypothetical possibility that they could become self-sufficient and able to make their own decisions. They discussed the possibility and the extent to which computers and robots might be able to acquire any level of autonomy, and to what degree they could use such abilities to possibly pose any threat or hazard. They noted that some machines have acquired various forms of semi-autonomy, including being able to find power sources on their own and being able to independently choose targets to attack with weapons. They also noted that some computer viruses can evade elimination and have achieved "cockroach intelligence". They noted that self-awareness as depicted in science-fiction is probably unlikely, but that there were other potential hazards and pitfalls.<ref name="nytimes july09" />

However, there is one technology in particular that has the potential to make the idea of morally capable robots a reality. In a paper on the acquisition of moral values by robots, Nayef Al-Rodhan mentions the case of [[Neuromorphic engineering|neuromorphic]] chips, which aim to process information similarly to humans, nonlinearly and with millions of interconnected artificial neurons.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Al-Rodhan|first1=Nayef|date=7 December 2015|title=The Moral Code|url=https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2015-08-12/moral-code|url-status=live|access-date=2017-03-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170305044025/https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2015-08-12/moral-code|archive-date=2017-03-05}}</ref> Robots embedded with neuromorphic technology could learn and develop knowledge in a uniquely humanlike way. Inevitably, this raises the question of the environment in which such robots would learn about the world and whose morality they would inherit – or if they end up developing human 'weaknesses' as well: selfishness, a pro-survival attitude, hesitation etc.

In ''Moral Machines: Teaching Robots Right from Wrong'',<ref name="Wallach2008">{{Cite book|last1=Wallach|first1=Wendell|title=Moral Machines: Teaching Robots Right from Wrong|last2=Allen|first2=Colin|date=November 2008|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|isbn=978-0-19-537404-9|location=USA <!--url=http://www.ttu.ee/public/m/mart-murdvee/Techno-Psy/Wallach_Allen_2008_Moral_Machines_-_Teaching_Robots_Right_from_Wrong.pdf-->}}</ref> Wendell Wallach and Colin Allen conclude that attempts to teach robots right from wrong will likely advance understanding of human ethics by motivating humans to address gaps in modern [[Normative ethics|normative theory]] and by providing a platform for experimental investigation.

[[Nick Bostrom]] and [[Eliezer Yudkowsky]] have argued for [[decision tree]]s (such as [[ID3 algorithm|ID3]]) over [[Artificial neural network|neural networks]] and [[genetic algorithm]]s on the grounds that decision trees obey modern social norms of transparency and predictability (e.g. ''[[stare decisis]]''),<ref>{{cite web|last1=Bostrom|first1=Nick|author-link1=Nick Bostrom|last2=Yudkowsky|first2=Eliezer|author-link2=Eliezer Yudkowsky|year=2011|title=The Ethics of Artificial Intelligence|url=http://www.nickbostrom.com/ethics/artificial-intelligence.pdf|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304015020/http://www.nickbostrom.com/ethics/artificial-intelligence.pdf|archive-date=2016-03-04|access-date=2011-06-22|work=Cambridge Handbook of Artificial Intelligence|publisher=[[Cambridge Press]]}}</ref> while Chris Santos-Lang argued in the opposite direction on the grounds that the norms of any age must be allowed to change and that natural failure to fully satisfy these particular norms has been essential in making humans less vulnerable to criminal "[[Hacker culture|hackers]]".<ref name="SantosLang2002">{{cite web|last=Santos-Lang|first=Chris|year=2002|title=Ethics for Artificial Intelligences|url=http://santoslang.wordpress.com/article/ethics-for-artificial-intelligences-3iue30fi4gfq9-1|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141225093359/http://santoslang.wordpress.com/article/ethics-for-artificial-intelligences-3iue30fi4gfq9-1/|archive-date=2014-12-25|access-date=2015-01-04}}</ref>

According to a 2019 report from the Center for the Governance of AI at the University of Oxford, 82% of Americans believe that robots and AI should be carefully managed. Concerns cited ranged from how AI is used in surveillance and in spreading fake content online (known as deep fakes when they include doctored video images and audio generated with help from AI) to cyberattacks, infringements on data privacy, hiring bias, autonomous vehicles, and drones that do not require a human controller.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Howard|first=Ayanna|title=The Regulation of AI – Should Organizations Be Worried? {{!}} Ayanna Howard|url=https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-regulation-of-ai-should-organizations-be-worried/|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190814134545/https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-regulation-of-ai-should-organizations-be-worried/|archive-date=2019-08-14|access-date=2019-08-14|website=MIT Sloan Management Review|date=29 July 2019 }}</ref> Similarly, according to a five-country [https://assets.kpmg.com/content/dam/kpmg/au/pdf/2021/trust-in-ai-multiple-countries.pdf study] by KPMG and the University of Queensland Australia in 2021, 66-79% of citizens in each country believe that the impact of AI on society is uncertain and unpredictable; 96% of those surveyed expect AI governance challenges to be managed carefully.

====Transparency, accountability, and open source====
[[Bill Hibbard]] argues that because AI will have such a profound effect on humanity, AI developers are representatives of future humanity and thus have an ethical obligation to be transparent in their efforts.<ref name="AGI-08a">[http://www.ssec.wisc.edu/~billh/g/hibbard_agi_workshop.pdf Open Source AI.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304054930/http://www.ssec.wisc.edu/~billh/g/hibbard_agi_workshop.pdf |date=2016-03-04 }} Bill Hibbard. 2008 proceedings of the First Conference on Artificial General Intelligence, eds.

Unfortunately, making code open source does not make it comprehensible, which by many definitions means that the AI code is not transparent. The [[IEEE Standards Association]] has published a [[Technical standards|technical standard]] on Transparency of Autonomous Systems: IEEE 7001-2021.<ref name="P7001">{{cite book |title=7001-2021 - IEEE Standard for Transparency of Autonomous Systems|date = 4 March 2022 |url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9726144|publisher=IEEE|doi = 10.1109/IEEESTD.2022.9726144 |isbn = 978-1-5044-8311-7 |s2cid = 252589405 |access-date=9 July 2023 |ref=p7001 }}.</ref> The IEEE effort identifies multiple scales of transparency for different stakeholders. Further, there is concern that releasing the full capacity of contemporary AI to some organizations may be a public bad, that is, do more damage than good. For example, Microsoft has expressed concern about allowing universal access to its face recognition software, even for those who can pay for it. Microsoft posted an extraordinary blog on this topic, asking for government regulation to help determine the right thing to do.<ref name="WiredMS">{{cite magazine |last1=Thurm |first1=Scott |title=MICROSOFT CALLS FOR FEDERAL REGULATION OF FACIAL RECOGNITION |url=https://www.wired.com/story/microsoft-calls-for-federal-regulation-of-facial-recognition/ |magazine=Wired |date=July 13, 2018 |ref=WiredMS |access-date=January 10, 2019 |archive-date=May 9, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190509231338/https://www.wired.com/story/microsoft-calls-for-federal-regulation-of-facial-recognition/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

Not only companies, but many other researchers and citizen advocates recommend government regulation as a means of ensuring transparency, and through it, human accountability. This strategy has proven controversial, as some worry that it will slow the rate of innovation. Others argue that regulation leads to systemic stability more able to support innovation in the long term.<ref name="DeloitteGDPR">{{cite web |last1=Bastin |first1=Roland |last2=Wantz |first2=Georges |title=The General Data Protection Regulation Cross-industry innovation |url=https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/lu/Documents/technology/lu-general-data-protection-regulation-cross-industry-innovation-062017.pdf |website=Inside magazine |publisher=Deloitte |ref=DeloitteGDPR |date=June 2017 |access-date=2019-01-10 |archive-date=2019-01-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190110183405/https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/lu/Documents/technology/lu-general-data-protection-regulation-cross-industry-innovation-062017.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref> The [[OECD]], [[UN]], [[EU]], and many countries are presently working on strategies for regulating AI, and finding appropriate legal frameworks.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.un.org/en/story/2017/06/558962-un-artificial-intelligence-summit-aims-tackle-poverty-humanitys-grand|title=UN artificial intelligence summit aims to tackle poverty, humanity's 'grand challenges'|date=2017-06-07|website=UN News|access-date=2019-07-26|archive-date=2019-07-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190726084819/https://news.un.org/en/story/2017/06/558962-un-artificial-intelligence-summit-aims-tackle-poverty-humanitys-grand|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/going-digital/ai/|title=Artificial intelligence – Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|website=www.oecd.org|access-date=2019-07-26|archive-date=2019-07-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190722124751/http://www.oecd.org/going-digital/ai/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/european-ai-alliance|title=The European AI Alliance|last=Anonymous|date=2018-06-14|website=Digital Single Market – European Commission|access-date=2019-07-26|archive-date=2019-08-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190801011543/https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/european-ai-alliance|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Biases in AI systems ===

AI has become increasingly inherent in facial and [[speech recognition|voice recognition]] systems. Some of these systems have real business applications and directly impact people. These systems are vulnerable to biases and errors introduced by its human creators. Also, the data used to train these AI systems itself can have biases.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/@Ethics_Society/the-case-for-fairer-algorithms-c008a12126f8|title=The case for fairer algorithms – Iason Gabriel|last=Gabriel|first=Iason|date=2018-03-14|website=Medium|access-date=2019-07-22|archive-date=2019-07-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190722080401/https://medium.com/@Ethics_Society/the-case-for-fairer-algorithms-c008a12126f8|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://social.techcrunch.com/2016/12/10/5-unexpected-sources-of-bias-in-artificial-intelligence/|title=5 unexpected sources of bias in artificial intelligence|website=TechCrunch|date=10 December 2016 |access-date=2019-07-22|archive-date=2021-03-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210318060659/https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/10/5-unexpected-sources-of-bias-in-artificial-intelligence/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/608986/forget-killer-robotsbias-is-the-real-ai-danger/|title=Google's AI chief says forget Elon Musk's killer robots, and worry about bias in AI systems instead|last=Knight|first=Will|website=MIT Technology Review|access-date=2019-07-22|archive-date=2019-07-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190704224752/https://www.technologyreview.com/s/608986/forget-killer-robotsbias-is-the-real-ai-danger/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.brookings.edu/blog/techtank/2019/01/03/artificial-intelligence-and-bias-four-key-challenges/|title=Artificial intelligence and bias: Four key challenges|last=Villasenor|first=John|date=2019-01-03|website=Brookings|access-date=2019-07-22|archive-date=2019-07-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190722080355/https://www.brookings.edu/blog/techtank/2019/01/03/artificial-intelligence-and-bias-four-key-challenges/|url-status=live}}</ref> For instance, [[Facial recognition system|facial recognition]] algorithms made by Microsoft, IBM and Face++ all had biases when it came to detecting people's gender;<ref>{{cite news |last1=Lohr |first1=Steve |title=Facial Recognition Is Accurate, if You're a White Guy |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/09/technology/facial-recognition-race-artificial-intelligence.html |work=The New York Times |date=9 February 2018 |access-date=29 May 2019 |archive-date=9 January 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190109131036/https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/09/technology/facial-recognition-race-artificial-intelligence.html |url-status=live }}</ref> these AI systems were able to detect gender of white men more accurately than gender of darker skin men.

Bias can creep into algorithms in many ways. The most predominant view on how bias is introduced into AI systems is that it is embedded within the historical data used to train the system. For instance, Amazon's AI-powered recruitment tool was trained with its own recruitment data accumulated over the years, during which time the candidates that successfully got the job were mostly white males. Consequently, the algorithms learned the (biased) pattern from the historical data and generated predictions for the present/future that these types of candidates are most likely to succeed in getting the job. Therefore, the recruitment decisions made by the AI system turn out to be biased against female and minority candidates. Friedman and Nissenbaum identify three categories of bias in computer systems: existing bias, technical bias, and emergent bias.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Friedman |first1=Batya |last2=Nissenbaum |first2=Helen |title=Bias in computer systems |journal=ACM Transactions on Information Systems |date=July 1996 |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=330–347 |doi=10.1145/230538.230561 |s2cid=207195759 }}</ref> In [[natural language processing]], problems can arise from the [[text corpus]] — the source material the algorithm uses to learn about the relationships between different words.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://techxplore.com/news/2019-07-bias-ai.html|title=Eliminating bias in AI|website=techxplore.com|access-date=2019-07-26|archive-date=2019-07-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190725200844/https://techxplore.com/news/2019-07-bias-ai.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

The problem of bias in machine learning is likely to become more significant as the technology spreads to critical areas like medicine and law, and as more people without a deep technical understanding are tasked with deploying it.

The philosophy of [[Sentientism]] grants degrees of moral consideration to all sentient beings, primarily humans and most non-human animals. If artificial or alien intelligence show evidence of being [[Sentience|sentient]], this philosophy holds that they should be shown compassion and granted rights.
	 
[[Joanna Bryson]] has argued that creating AI that requires rights is both avoidable, and would in itself be unethical, both as a burden to the AI agents and to human society.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Close engagements with artificial companions: key social, psychological, ethical and design issues|date=2010|publisher=John Benjamins Pub.

===Artificial suffering===
In 2020, professor Shimon Edelman noted that only a small portion of work in the rapidly growing field of AI ethics addressed the possibility of AIs experiencing suffering. This was despite credible theories having outlined possible ways by which AI systems may became conscious, such as [[Integrated information theory]]. Edelman notes one exception had been [[Thomas Metzinger]], who in 2018 called for a global moratorium on further work that risked creating conscious AIs. The moratorium was to run to 2050 and could be either extended or repealed early, depending on progress in better understanding the risks and how to mitigate them. Metzinger repeated this argument in 2021, highlighting the risk of creating an "explosion of artificial suffering", both as an AI might suffer in intense ways that humans could not understand, and as replication processes may see the creation of huge quantities of artificial conscious instances. Several labs have openly stated they are trying to create conscious AIs. There have been reports from those with close access to AIs not openly intended to be self aware, that consciousness may already have unintentionally emerged. These include [[OpenAI]] founder [[Ilya Sutskever]] in February 2022, when he wrote that today's large neural nets may be "slightly conscious". In November 2022, [[David Chalmers]] argued that it was unlikely current large language models like [[GPT-3]] had experienced consciousness, but also that he considered there to be a serious possibility that large language models may become conscious in the future.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Agarwal A, Edelman S | title = Functionally effective conscious AI without suffering | journal = [[Journal of Artificial Intelligence and Consciousness]] | volume = 7| pages = 39–50 | date =2020  | pmid = | doi = 10.1142/S2705078520300030| arxiv = 2002.05652 | s2cid = 211096533 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = [[Thomas Metzinger]] | title = Artificial Suffering: An Argument for a Global Moratorim on Synthetic Phenomenology| journal = [[Journal of Artificial Intelligence and Consciousness]] | volume = 8 | pages = 43–66  | date = February 2021  | pmid = | doi = 10.1142/S270507852150003X | s2cid = 233176465}}</ref><ref>{{cite arXiv |last=Chalmers |first=David |author-link=David Chalmers |eprint=2303.07103v1 |title=Could a Large Language Model be Conscious? |class=Computer Science |date=March 2023 }}</ref>

===Threat to human dignity===
{{Main|Computer Power and Human Reason}}
[[Joseph Weizenbaum]]<ref name="Weizenbaum's critique"/> argued in 1976 that AI technology should not be used to replace people in positions that require respect and care, such as:
* A customer service representative (AI technology is already used today for telephone-based [[interactive voice response]] systems)
* A nursemaid for the elderly (as was reported by [[Pamela McCorduck]] in her book ''The Fifth Generation'')
* A soldier
* A judge
* A police officer
* A therapist (as was proposed by [[Kenneth Colby]] in the 70s)

Weizenbaum explains that we require authentic feelings of [[empathy]] from people in these positions. If machines replace them, we will find ourselves alienated, devalued and frustrated, for the artificially intelligent system would not be able to simulate empathy. Artificial intelligence, if used in this way, represents a threat to human dignity. Weizenbaum argues that the fact that we are entertaining the possibility of machines in these positions suggests that we have experienced an "atrophy of the human spirit that comes from thinking of ourselves as computers."<ref name="MWZ">[[Joseph Weizenbaum]], quoted in {{Harvnb|McCorduck|2004|pp=356, 374–376}}</ref>

[[Pamela McCorduck]] counters that, speaking for women and minorities "I'd rather take my chances with an impartial computer", pointing out that there are conditions where we would prefer to have automated judges and police that have no personal agenda at all.<ref name=MWZ/> However, [[Andreas Kaplan|Kaplan]] and Haenlein stress that AI systems are only as smart as the data used to train them since they are, in their essence, nothing more than fancy curve-fitting machines; Using AI to support a court ruling can be highly problematic if past rulings show bias toward certain groups since those biases get formalized and engrained, which makes them even more difficult to spot and fight against.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kaplan|first1=Andreas|last2=Haenlein|first2=Michael|date=January 2019|title=Siri, Siri, in my hand: Who's the fairest in the land?

Weizenbaum was also bothered that AI researchers (and some philosophers) were willing to view the human mind as nothing more than a computer program (a position now known as [[computationalism]]). To Weizenbaum, these points suggest that AI research devalues human life.<ref name="Weizenbaum's critique">

In another incident on March 18, 2018, [[Elaine Herzberg]] was struck and killed by a self-driving [[Uber]] in Arizona. In this case, the automated car was capable of detecting cars and certain obstacles in order to autonomously navigate the roadway, but it could not anticipate a pedestrian in the middle of the road. This raised the question of whether the driver, pedestrian, the car company, or the government should be held responsible for her death.<ref>{{Citation|last=Stilgoe|first=Jack|title=Who Killed Elaine Herzberg?|date=2020|url=http://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-3-030-32320-2_1|work=Who’s Driving Innovation?|pages=1–6|place=Cham|publisher=Springer International Publishing|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-3-030-32320-2_1|isbn=978-3-030-32319-6|s2cid=214359377|access-date=2020-11-11|archive-date=2021-03-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210318060722/https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-030-32320-2_1|url-status=live}}</ref>

There has been a recent outcry with regard to the engineering of artificial intelligence weapons that have included ideas of a [[AI takeover|robot takeover of mankind]]. AI weapons do present a type of danger different from that of human-controlled weapons. Many governments have begun to fund programs to develop AI weaponry. The United States Navy recently announced plans to develop [[Unmanned combat aerial vehicle|autonomous drone weapons]], paralleling similar announcements by Russia and South Korea<ref>{{Cite news |title=South Korea developing new stealthy drones to support combat aircraft |last=Dominguez |first=Gabriel |date=23 August 2022 |work=[[The Japan Times]] |url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2022/08/23/asia-pacific/south-korea-stealth-drones-development/ |access-date=14 June 2023}}</ref> respectively. Due to the potential of AI weapons becoming more dangerous than human-operated weapons, [[Stephen Hawking]] and [[Max Tegmark]] signed a "Future of Life" petition<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://futureoflife.org/ai-principles/|title=AI Principles|website=Future of Life Institute|date=11 August 2017 |access-date=2019-07-26|archive-date=2017-12-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171211171044/https://futureoflife.org/ai-principles/|url-status=live}}</ref> to ban AI weapons. The message posted by Hawking and Tegmark states that AI weapons pose an immediate danger and that action is required to avoid catastrophic disasters in the near future.<ref name="theatlantic.com">{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/08/humans-not-robots-are-the-real-reason-artificial-intelligence-is-scary/400994/|title=Why Artificial Intelligence Can Too Easily Be Weaponized – The Atlantic|author=Zach Musgrave and Bryan W.

"If any major military power pushes ahead with the AI weapon development, a global [[arms race]] is virtually inevitable, and the endpoint of this technological trajectory is obvious: autonomous weapons will become the [[AK-47|Kalashnikovs]] of tomorrow", says the petition, which includes [[Skype]] co-founder [[Jaan Tallinn]] and MIT professor of linguistics [[Noam Chomsky]] as additional supporters against AI weaponry.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2015/07/27/musk-hawking-warn-of-artificial-intelligence-weapons/|title=Musk, Hawking Warn of Artificial Intelligence Weapons|author=Cat Zakrzewski|work=WSJ|date=2015-07-27|access-date=2017-08-04|archive-date=2015-07-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150728173944/http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2015/07/27/musk-hawking-warn-of-artificial-intelligence-weapons/|url-status=live}}</ref>

Physicist and Astronomer Royal [[Sir Martin Rees]] has warned of catastrophic instances like "dumb robots going rogue or a network that develops a mind of its own." [[Huw Price]], a colleague of Rees at Cambridge, has voiced a similar warning that humans might not survive when intelligence "escapes the constraints of biology". These two professors created the [[Centre for the Study of Existential Risk]] at Cambridge University in the hope of avoiding this threat to human existence.<ref name="theatlantic.com"/>

Regarding the potential for smarter-than-human systems to be employed militarily, the [[Open Philanthropy Project]] writes that these scenarios "seem potentially as important as the risks related to loss of control", but research investigating AI's long-run social impact have spent relatively little time on this concern: "this class of scenarios has not been a major focus for the organizations that have been most active in this space, such as the [[Machine Intelligence Research Institute]] (MIRI) and the [[Future of Humanity Institute]] (FHI), and there seems to have been less analysis and debate regarding them".<ref name="givewell">{{cite report |author=GiveWell |author-link=GiveWell |date=2015 |title=Potential risks from advanced artificial intelligence |url=http://www.givewell.org/labs/causes/ai-risk |access-date=11 October 2015 |archive-date=12 October 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151012084043/http://www.givewell.org/labs/causes/ai-risk |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Opaque algorithms===
Approaches like machine learning with [[neural network]]s can result in computers making decisions that they and the humans who programmed them cannot explain. It is difficult for people to determine if such decisions are fair and trustworthy, leading potentially to bias in AI systems going undetected, or people rejecting the use of such systems. This has led to advocacy and in some jurisdictions legal requirements for [[explainable artificial intelligence]].<ref>[https://think.kera.org/2017/12/05/inside-the-mind-of-a-i/ Inside The Mind Of A.I.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210810003331/https://think.kera.org/2017/12/05/inside-the-mind-of-a-i/ |date=2021-08-10 }} - Cliff Kuang interview</ref> Explainable artificial intelligence encompasses both explainability and interpretability, with explainability relating to summarizing neural network behavior and building user confidence, while interpretability is defined as the comprehension of what a model has done or could do.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Bunn |first=Jenny |date=2020-04-13 |title=Working in contexts for which transparency is important: A recordkeeping view of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) |url=https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/RMJ-08-2019-0038/full/html |journal=Records Management Journal |language=en |volume=30 |issue=2 |pages=143–153 |doi=10.1108/RMJ-08-2019-0038 |s2cid=219079717 |issn=0956-5698}}</ref>

===Negligent or Deliberate Misuse of AI===
A special case of the opaqueness of AI is that caused by it being [[anthropomorphised]], that is, assumed to have human-like characteristics, resulting in misplaced conceptions of its [[moral agency]]. This can cause people to overlook whether either human [[negligence]] or deliberate criminal action has led to unethical outcomes produced through an AI system. Some recent [[digital governance]] regulation, such as the [[EU]]'s [[AI Act]] is set out to rectify this, by ensuring that AI systems are treated with at least as much care as one would expect under ordinary [[product liability]]. This includes potentially [[Information technology audit|AI audits]].

==Singularity==
{{Further|Existential risk from artificial general intelligence|Superintelligence|Technological singularity}}

Many researchers have argued that, by way of an "intelligence explosion", a self-improving AI could become so powerful that humans would not be able to stop it from achieving its goals.<ref name="Muehlhauser, Luke 2012">Muehlhauser, Luke, and Louie Helm. 2012. [https://intelligence.org/files/IE-ME.pdf "Intelligence Explosion and Machine Ethics"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150507173028/http://intelligence.org/files/IE-ME.pdf |date=2015-05-07 }}. In Singularity Hypotheses: A Scientific and Philosophical Assessment, edited by Amnon Eden, Johnny Søraker, James H. Moor, and Eric Steinhart. Berlin: Springer.</ref> In his paper "Ethical Issues in Advanced Artificial Intelligence" and subsequent book ''[[Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies]]'', philosopher [[Nick Bostrom]] argues that artificial intelligence has the capability to bring about human extinction. He claims that general [[superintelligence]] would be capable of independent initiative and of making its own plans, and may therefore be more appropriately thought of as an autonomous agent. Since artificial intellects need not share our human motivational tendencies, it would be up to the designers of the superintelligence to specify its original motivations. Because a superintelligent AI would be able to bring about almost any possible outcome and to thwart any attempt to prevent the implementation of its goals, many uncontrolled [[unintended consequences]] could arise. It could kill off all other agents, persuade them to change their behavior, or block their attempts at interference.<ref name="Bostrom, Nick 2003">Bostrom, Nick. 2003. [http://www.nickbostrom.com/ethics/ai.html "Ethical Issues in Advanced Artificial Intelligence"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181008090224/http://www.nickbostrom.com/ethics/ai.html |date=2018-10-08 }}.

However, instead of overwhelming the human race and leading to our destruction, Bostrom has also asserted that superintelligence can help us solve many difficult problems such as disease, poverty, and environmental destruction, and could help us to "enhance" ourselves.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Umbrello|first1=Steven|last2=Baum|first2=Seth D.|date=2018-06-01|title=Evaluating future nanotechnology: The net societal impacts of atomically precise manufacturing|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016328717301908|journal=Futures|language=en|volume=100|pages=63–73|doi=10.1016/j.futures.2018.04.007|hdl=2318/1685533|s2cid=158503813|issn=0016-3287|access-date=2020-11-29|archive-date=2019-05-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190509222110/https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016328717301908|url-status=live}}</ref>

The sheer complexity of human value systems makes it very difficult to make AI's motivations human-friendly.<ref name="Muehlhauser, Luke 2012" /><ref name="Bostrom, Nick 2003" /> Unless moral philosophy provides us with a flawless ethical theory, an AI's utility function could allow for many potentially harmful scenarios that conform with a given ethical framework but not "common sense".

==Institutions in AI policy & ethics==
There are many organisations concerned with AI ethics and policy, public and governmental as well as corporate and societal.

[[Amazon.com, Inc.|Amazon]], [[Google]], [[Facebook]], [[IBM]], and [[Microsoft]] have established a [[Nonprofit organization|non-profit]], The Partnership on AI to Benefit People and Society, to formulate best practices on artificial intelligence technologies, advance the public's understanding, and to serve as a platform about artificial intelligence.

The [[IEEE]] put together a Global Initiative on Ethics of Autonomous and Intelligent Systems which has been creating and revising guidelines with the help of public input, and accepts as members many professionals from within and without its organization.

Traditionally, [[government]] has been used by societies to ensure ethics are observed through legislation and policing. There are now many efforts by national governments, as well as transnational government and [[NGO|non-government organizations]] to ensure AI is ethically applied.

AI ethics work is structured by personal values and professional commitments, and involves constructing contextual meaning through data and algorithms. Therefore, AI ethics work needs to be incentivized.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Slota |first1=Stephen C. |last2=Fleischmann |first2=Kenneth R. |last3=Greenberg |first3=Sherri |last4=Verma |first4=Nitin |last5=Cummings |first5=Brenna |last6=Li |first6=Lan |last7=Shenefiel |first7=Chris |date=2023 |title=Locating the work of artificial intelligence ethics |url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asi.24638 |journal=Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology |language=en |volume=74 |issue=3 |pages=311–322 |doi=10.1002/asi.24638 |s2cid=247342066 |issn=2330-1635}}</ref>

== Role and impact of fiction ==
{{Main|Artificial intelligence in fiction}}
The role of fiction with regards to AI ethics has been a complex one. One can distinguish three levels at which fiction has impacted the development of artificial intelligence and robotics: Historically, fiction has been prefiguring common tropes that have not only influenced goals and visions for AI, but also outlined ethical questions and common fears associated with it. During the second half of the twentieth and the first decades of the twenty-first century, popular culture, in particular movies, TV series and video games have frequently echoed preoccupations and dystopian projections around ethical questions concerning AI and robotics. Recently, these themes have also been increasingly treated in literature beyond the realm of science fiction. And, as Carme Torras, research professor at the ''Institut de Robòtica i Informàtica Industrial'' (Institute of robotics and industrial computing) at the Technical University of Catalonia notes,<ref>Torras, Carme, (2020), “Science-Fiction: A Mirror for the Future of Humankind” in ''IDEES'', Centre d'estudis de temes contemporanis (CETC), Barcelona. https://revistaidees.cat/en/science-fiction-favors-engaging-debate-on-artificial-intelligence-and-ethics/ {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210422164230/https://revistaidees.cat/en/science-fiction-favors-engaging-debate-on-artificial-intelligence-and-ethics/ |date=2021-04-22 }} Retrieved on 2021-06-10</ref> in higher education, science fiction is also increasingly used for teaching technology-related ethical issues in technological degrees.

=== History ===

Historically speaking, the investigation of moral and ethical implications of "thinking machines" goes back at least to the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]: [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] already poses the question if we might attribute intelligence to a mechanism that behaves as if it were a sentient being,<ref>Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, (1714): Monadology, § 17 ("Mill Argument"). See also: Lodge, P. (2014): "Leibniz's Mill Argument: Against Mechanical Materialism Revisited", in ERGO, Volume 1, No. 03) https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/ergo/12405314.0001.003/--leibniz-s-mill-argument-against-mechanical-materialism?rgn=main;view=fulltext {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210430173613/https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/ergo/12405314.0001.003/--leibniz-s-mill-argument-against-mechanical-materialism?rgn=main;view=fulltext |date=2021-04-30 }} Retrieved on 2021-06-10</ref> and so does [[René Descartes|Descartes]], who describes what could be considered an early version of the [[Turing test]].<ref>Cited in Bringsjord, Selmer and Naveen Sundar Govindarajulu, "Artificial Intelligence", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Summer 2020 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = <https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2020/entries/artificial-intelligence/ {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220308015735/https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2020/entries/artificial-intelligence/ |date=2022-03-08 }}>. Retrieved on 2021-06-10</ref>

The [[Romanticism|romantic]] period has several times envisioned artificial creatures that escape the control of their creator with dire consequences, most famously in [[Mary Shelley]]'s ''[[Frankenstein]]''. The widespread preoccupation with industrialization and mechanization in the 19th and early 20th century, however, brought ethical implications of unhinged technical developments to the forefront of fiction: [[R.U.R.|''R.U.R – Rossum's Universal Robots'']], [[Karel Čapek]]'s play of sentient robots endowed with emotions used as slave labor is not only credited with the invention of the term 'robot' (derived from the Czech word for forced labor, ''robota'') but was also an international success after it premiered in 1921. [[George Bernard Shaw]]'s play ''[[Back to Methuselah]]'', published in 1921, questions at one point the validity of thinking machines that act like humans; [[Fritz Lang]]'s 1927 film ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]'' shows an [[Android (robot)|android]] leading the uprising of the exploited masses against the oppressive regime of a [[Technocracy|technocratic]] society.

=== Impact on technological development ===

While the anticipation of a future dominated by potentially indomitable technology has fueled the imagination of writers and film makers for a long time, one question has been less frequently analyzed, namely, to what extent fiction has played a role in providing inspiration for technological development. It has been documented, for instance, that the young Alan Turing saw and appreciated aforementioned Shaw's play ''Back to Methuselah'' in 1933<ref>Hodges, A. (2014), ''Alan Turing: The Enigma'',Vintage, London, p. 334</ref> (just 3 years before the publication of his first seminal paper,<ref>A. M. Turing (1936). "On computable numbers, with an application to the Entscheidungsproblem." in ''Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society'', 2 s. vol. 42 (1936–1937), pp. 230–265.</ref> which laid the groundwork for the digital computer), and he would likely have been at least aware of plays like ''R.U.R.'', which was an international success and translated into many languages.

One might also ask the question which role science fiction played in establishing the tenets and ethical implications of AI development: Isaac Asimov conceptualized his [[Three Laws of Robotics]] in the 1942 short story  "[[Runaround (story)|Runaround]]", part of the short story collection  ''[[I, Robot]]''; [[Arthur C. Clarke]]'s short ''[[The Sentinel (short story)|The Sentinel]]'', on which [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s film ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' is based, was written in 1948 and published in 1952. Another example (among many others) would be [[Philip K. Dick]]'s numerous short stories and novels – in particular ''[[Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?]]'', published in 1968, and featuring its own version of a Turing Test, the [[Blade Runner#Voight-Kampff machine|''Voight-Kampff Test'']], to gauge emotional responses of androids indistinguishable from humans. The novel later became the basis of the influential 1982 movie ''[[Blade Runner]]'' by [[Ridley Scott]].

Science fiction has been grappling with ethical implications of AI developments for decades, and thus provided a blueprint for ethical issues that might emerge once something akin to general artificial intelligence has been achieved: [[Spike Jonze]]'s 2013 film [[Her (film)|''Her'']] shows what can happen if a user falls in love with the seductive voice of his smartphone operating system; [[Ex Machina (film)|''Ex Machina'']], on the other hand, asks a more difficult question: if confronted with a clearly recognizable machine, made only human by a face and an empathetic and sensual voice, would we still be able to establish an emotional connection, still be seduced by it?  (The film echoes a theme already present two centuries earlier, in the 1817 short story ''[[The Sandman (short story)|The Sandmann]]'' by [[E. T. A. Hoffmann]].)

The theme of coexistence with artificial sentient beings is also the theme of two recent novels: ''[[Machines Like Me]]'' by [[Ian McEwan]], published in 2019, involves, among many other things, a love-triangle involving an artificial person as well as a human couple. ''[[Klara and the Sun]]'' by [[Nobel Prize in Literature|Nobel Prize]] winner [[Kazuo Ishiguro]], published in 2021, is the first-person account of Klara, an 'AF' (artificial friend), who is trying, in her own way, to help the girl she is living with, who, after having been 'lifted' (i.e. having been subjected to genetic enhancements), is suffering from a strange illness.

=== TV series ===

While ethical questions linked to AI have been featured in science fiction literature and [[List of artificial intelligence films|feature films]] for decades, the emergence of the TV series as a genre allowing for longer and more complex story lines and character development has led to some significant contributions that deal with ethical implications of technology. The Swedish series ''[[Real Humans]]'' (2012–2013) tackled the complex ethical and social consequences linked to the integration of artificial sentient beings in society. The British dystopian science fiction anthology series ''[[Black Mirror]]'' (2013–2019) was particularly notable for experimenting with dystopian fictional developments linked to a wide variety of recent technology developments. Both the French series [[Osmosis (TV series)|''Osmosis'']] (2020) and British series [[The One (TV series)|''The One'']] deal with the question of what can happen if technology tries to find the ideal partner for a person. Several episodes of the Netflix series [[Love, Death & Robots|''Love, Death+Robots'']] have imagined scenes of robots and humans living together. The most representative one of them is S02 E01, it shows how bad the consequences can be when robots get out of control if humans rely too much on them in their lives.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2021-05-14|title=Love, Death & Robots season 2, episode 1 recap - "Automated Customer Service"|url=https://readysteadycut.com/2021/05/14/recap-love-death-and-robots-season-2-episode-1-automated-customer-service-netflix-series/|access-date=2021-12-21|website=Ready Steady Cut|language=en-GB|archive-date=2021-12-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211221035251/https://readysteadycut.com/2021/05/14/recap-love-death-and-robots-season-2-episode-1-automated-customer-service-netflix-series/|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Future visions in fiction and games ===

The movie ''[[The Thirteenth Floor]]'' suggests a future where [[simulated reality|simulated worlds]] with sentient inhabitants are created by computer [[game console]]s for the purpose of entertainment. The movie ''[[The Matrix]]'' suggests a future where the dominant species on planet Earth are sentient machines and humanity is treated with utmost [[speciesism]]. The short story "[[The Planck Dive]]" suggests a future where humanity has turned itself into software that can be duplicated and optimized and the relevant distinction between types of software is sentient and non-sentient. The same idea can be found in the [[Emergency Medical Hologram]] of ''[[USS Voyager (NCC-74656)|Starship Voyager]]'', which is an apparently sentient copy of a reduced subset of the consciousness of its creator, [[Lewis Zimmerman|Dr. Zimmerman]], who, for the best motives, has created the system to give medical assistance in case of emergencies. The movies ''[[Bicentennial Man (film)|Bicentennial Man]]'' and ''[[A.I. Artificial Intelligence|A.I.]]'' deal with the possibility of sentient robots that could love. ''[[I, Robot (film)|I, Robot]]'' explored some aspects of Asimov's three laws. All these scenarios try to foresee possibly unethical consequences of the creation of sentient computers.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1143647559|title=AI narratives: a history of imaginative thinking about intelligent machines|editor=Cave, Stephen|editor2= Dihal, Kanta|editor3= Dillon, Sarah|date=14 February 2020|isbn=978-0-19-258604-9|edition=First|location=Oxford|oclc=1143647559|access-date=11 November 2020|archive-date=18 March 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210318060703/https://www.worldcat.org/title/ai-narratives-a-history-of-imaginative-thinking-about-intelligent-machines/oclc/1143647559|url-status=live}}</ref>

The ethics of artificial intelligence is one of several core themes in BioWare's [[Mass Effect]] series of games.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Jerreat-Poole|first=Adam|date=1 February 2020|title=Sick, Slow, Cyborg: Crip Futurity in Mass Effect|url=http://gamestudies.org/2001/articles/jerreatpoole|journal=Game Studies|volume=20|issn=1604-7982|access-date=11 November 2020|archive-date=9 December 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201209080256/http://gamestudies.org/2001/articles/jerreatpoole|url-status=live}}</ref> It explores the scenario of a civilization accidentally creating AI through a rapid increase in computational power through a global scale [[neural network]]. This event caused an ethical schism between those who felt bestowing organic rights upon the newly sentient Geth was appropriate and those who continued to see them as disposable machinery and fought to destroy them. Beyond the initial conflict, the complexity of the relationship between the machines and their creators is another ongoing theme throughout the story.

''[[Detroit: Become Human]]'' is one of the most famous video games which discusses the ethics of artificial intelligence recently. Quantic Dream designed the chapters of the game using interactive storylines to give players a more immersive gaming experience. Players manipulate three different awakened bionic people in the face of different events to make different choices to achieve the purpose of changing the human view of the bionic group and different choices will result in different endings. This is one of the few games that puts players in the bionic perspective, which allows them to better consider the rights and interests of robots once a true artificial intelligence is created.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2018-08-06|title="Detroit: Become Human" Will Challenge your Morals and your Humanity|url=https://coffeeordie.com/detroit-become-human-will-challenge-your-morals-and-your-humanity/|access-date=2021-12-07|website=Coffee or Die Magazine|language=en-US|archive-date=2021-12-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211209195312/https://coffeeordie.com/detroit-become-human-will-challenge-your-morals-and-your-humanity/|url-status=live}}</ref>

Over time, debates have tended to focus less and less on ''possibility'' and more on ''desirability'',<ref>{{Citation|last1=Cerqui|first1=Daniela|title=Re-Designing Humankind: The Rise of Cyborgs, a Desirable Goal?|date=2008|url=http://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-1-4020-6591-0_14|work=Philosophy and Design|pages=185–195|place=Dordrecht|publisher=Springer Netherlands|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-1-4020-6591-0_14|isbn=978-1-4020-6590-3|access-date=2020-11-11|last2=Warwick|first2=Kevin|archive-date=2021-03-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210318060701/https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-1-4020-6591-0_14|url-status=live}}</ref> as emphasized in the [[Hugo de Garis#The Artilect War|"Cosmist" and "Terran" debates]] initiated by [[Hugo de Garis]] and [[Kevin Warwick]]. A Cosmist, according to Hugo de Garis, is actually seeking to build more intelligent successors to the human species.

Experts at the University of Cambridge have argued that AI is portrayed in fiction and nonfiction overwhelmingly as racially White, in ways that distort perceptions of its risks and benefits.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Cave |first1=Stephen |last2=Dihal |first2=Kanta |title=The Whiteness of AI |journal=Philosophy & Technology |date=6 August 2020 |volume=33 |issue=4 |pages=685–703 |doi=10.1007/s13347-020-00415-6 |s2cid=225466550 }}</ref>
