'''Mien shiang''' ({{zh|c={{linktext|面|相}}|p=miànxiàng}} meaning face ({{transl|zh|mien}}) reading ({{transl|zh|shiang}})) is a [[physiognomic]] and [[fortune-telling]] practice in [[Chinese culture]] and [[traditional Chinese medicine]] which purports to determine aspects of person's character, personality, and (future) health by analyzing their face according to the five phases (''"[[Wuxing (Chinese philosophy)|wu xing]]"''). The five phases (namely [[Wood (wuxing)|wood]], [[Fire (wuxing)|fire]], [[Earth (wuxing)|earth]], [[Metal (wuxing)|metal]], and [[Water (wuxing)|water]]) are metaphors devised by ancient [[Chinese philosophy|Chinese philosopher]]s to explain the relationship, interaction, and ongoing change of everything in the universe.<ref name="mien" /> In recent times the art of face reading has become more popular and schools that teach {{transl|zh|mien shiang}} more wide spread.{{cn|date=December 2021}}

==Historical records==
There are early written records of {{transl|zh|mien shiang}}. In [[Book of Rites]], it writes, "Those who look up are arrogant; Those who look down are worried; Those who look sideways are sly". After [[Gou Jian]] ({{lang|zh|勾践}}) of [[Yue (state)|Yue]] ({{circa|470 BCE}}) settled the [[Wu (state)|State of Wu]], [[Fan Li]] ({{lang|zh|范蠡}}) (536–488 BCE) knew that Gou Jian had a "long neck and sharp upper lips", which meant they could face hardship together but not enjoy peace together.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Records of the Grand Historian of China |script-title=zh:史记‧越王勾践世家}}</ref> Fan Li later fled with [[Xi Shi]] ({{lang|zh|西施}}) to the [[Qi (state)|State of Qi]] and changed their names to lead a new life. Another historical example in which Mien Shiang was used was [[Wang Anshi]] ({{lang|zh|王安石}}) of [[Song Dynasty]]. Wang's eyes resembled those of ox, and his head shaped like those of tigers.<ref>{{Cite book|title=History of Song |script-title=zh:宋史·萧注传}}</ref> It was said{{by whom|date=December 2021}} that if Wang could stare straight at the sun, he had a face with good fortune ({{lang|zh|贵相}}).{{cn|date=December 2021}}
