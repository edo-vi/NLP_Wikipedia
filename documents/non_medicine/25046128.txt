"'''Century of humiliation'''" or  "'''hundred years of national humiliation'''" is a term used in China to describe the period of intervention and subjugation of the [[Qing dynasty]] and the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] by [[Western world|Western powers]] and [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] from 1839 to the 1940s.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1976-5118.2010.01039.x | volume=25 | issue=1 | title=The "Century of Humiliation," Then and Now: Chinese Perceptions of the International Order | year=2010 | journal=Pacific Focus | pages=1–33 | last1 = Adcock Kaufman | first1 = Alison}}</ref>

The use of "humiliation" arose in the atmosphere of rising [[Chinese nationalism]] opposing the [[Twenty-One Demands]] made by the [[Japanese government]] in 1915 and grew with protests against China's treatment in the [[Treaty of Versailles]] in 1919. The [[Kuomintang]] (Chinese Nationalist Party) and [[Chinese Communist Party]] popularized the characterization in the 1920s, protesting the [[Unequal Treaties]] and loss of territory. In the 1930s and 1940s, it became common to refer to "A Century of Humiliation." {{sfnb|Callahan|2008|p=210}} Although the formal treaty provisions were ended, the idea remains a central concept in Chinese nationalism, widely used in both political and popular culture.{{sfnb|Gries|2004|p= 45}}

In that period, China suffered major internal fragmentation, lost almost all of the wars that it fought, and was often forced to give major concessions to the [[great powers]] in [[unequal treaty|unequal treaties]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://app1.chinadaily.com.cn/star/2003/1120/cu18-1.html|title=Poisoned path to openness|first=Lan|last=Nike|publisher=[[Shanghai Star]]|date=2003-11-20|access-date=2010-08-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100323033925/http://app1.chinadaily.com.cn/star/2003/1120/cu18-1.html|archive-date=2010-03-23|url-status=dead}}</ref> In many cases, China was forced to pay large amounts of [[war reparations|reparations]], open up ports for trade, [[list of former foreign enclaves in China|lease or cede territories]] (such as [[Outer Manchuria]], parts of [[Manchuria]] ([[Northwest China]]) and [[Sakhalin]] to the [[Russian Empire]], [[Kiautschou Bay concession|Jiaozhou Bay]] to the [[German Empire]], Hong Kong and [[British Weihaiwei|Weihai]] to the British Empire, [[Portuguese Macau|Macau]] to the [[Portuguese Empire]], [[Leased Territory of Guangzhouwan|Zhanjiang]] to [[French Indochina|France]], and [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|Taiwan]] and [[Kwantung Leased Territory|Dalian]] to Japan), and make various other concessions of sovereignty to foreign "[[sphere of influence|spheres of influence]]" after military defeats.

===End of humiliation===
Already during the conclusion of the [[Boxer Protocol]] in 1901, some of the Western powers believed they had acted in excess and that the Protocol was too humiliating.{{Citation needed|date=March 2023}} As a result, U.S. Secretary of State [[John Hay]] formulated the [[Open Door Policy]], which prevented the colonial powers from directly carving up China into ''[[de jure]]'' colonies, and guaranteed universal trade access to markets in China. Intended to weaken Germany, Japan, and Russia, it was only somewhat enforced and was gradually broken by the following [[Warlord Era|warlord era]] and Japanese interventions.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Cullinane|first=Michael Patrick|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gjRWDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA25|title=Open Door Era: United States Foreign Policy in the Twentieth Century|date=2017-01-17|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|isbn=978-1-4744-0132-6|pages=25–26, 178|language=en}}</ref> The semi-contradictory nature of the Open Door policy was noted early, as although it preserved the territorial integrity of China from foreign powers, it also led to trade exploitation by the same countries. With the [[Root–Takahira Agreement]] in 1908, the U.S. and Japan upheld the Open Door Policy, but other factors (such as immigration restrictions, and the assignment of the Boxer Indemnity to a managed [[Boxer Indemnity Scholarship]] instead of being directly returned to the [[Qing dynasty|Qing government]]) led to a continuation in humiliation from the Chinese perspective.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Moore|first=Gregory|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-GnHCQAAQBAJ|title=Defining and Defending the Open Door Policy: Theodore Roosevelt and China, 1901–1909|date=2015-05-27|publisher=Lexington Books|isbn=978-0-7391-9996-1|pages=xiii, xiv, xv|language=en}}</ref> In the Republic of China mainland era, the 1922 [[Nine-Power Treaty]] was also a major attempt to reaffirm Chinese sovereignty, though it failed to check Japan's expansionism and had a limited effect on extraterritoriality.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Unoki |first=Ko |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hi3uCwAAQBAJ |title=International Relations and the Origins of the Pacific War |date=2016-04-08 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-1-137-57202-8 |pages=108 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last=Jianlang |first=Wang |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e5PRDgAAQBAJ |title=Unequal Treaties and China (2-Volume Set) |date=2015-11-27 |publisher=Enrich Professional Publishing Limited |isbn=978-1-62320-119-7 |pages=139 |language=en}}</ref> [[Open Door Policy|Open Door]] was ultimately dissolved in [[World War II|WWII]] when Japan [[Japanese invasion of Manchuria|invaded]] China.

Extraterritorial jurisdiction and other privileges were [[Sino-British Treaty for the Relinquishment of Extra-Territorial Rights in China|abandoned by the United Kingdom]] and [[Sino-American Treaty for the Relinquishment of Extraterritorial Rights in China|the United States]] in 1943. During [[World War II]], [[Vichy France]] retained control over French concessions in [[China]] but was coerced into handing them over to the collaborationist [[Wang Jingwei regime]]. The postwar Sino-French Accord of February 1946 affirmed Chinese sovereignty over the concessions.

Chiang Kai-shek declared the end of the Century of Humiliation in 1943 with the abrogation of all the unequal treaties and Mao Zedong declared its end in the [[aftermath of World War II]], with Chiang promoting his wartime resistance to Japanese rule and China's place among the [[Four Policemen|Big Four]] in the victorious [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] in 1945, and Mao declared it with the [[Chinese Revolution (1949)|establishment]] of the [[People's Republic of China]] in 1949.

Chinese politicians and writers, however, have continued to portray later events as the true end of humiliation. Its end was declared in the [[People's Volunteer Army|repulsion of UN forces during the Korean War]], the 1997 [[transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong|reunification with Hong Kong]], the 1999 [[transfer of sovereignty over Macau|reunification with Macau]], and even the hosting of the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] in Beijing.

In 2021, coinciding with the [[United States–China talks in Alaska]], the [[Government of China|Chinese government]] began referring to the period as 120 years of humiliation, a reference to the 1901 [[Boxer Protocol]] in which the Qing were forced to pay large reparations to members of the [[Eight-Nation Alliance]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Ross Smith |first1=Nicholas |last2=Fallon |first2=Tracey |title=How the CCP Uses History |url=https://thediplomat.com/2021/07/how-the-ccp-uses-history/ |website=thediplomat.com |publisher=The Diplomat |access-date=7 July 2021}}</ref>

==Commentary and criticism==

[[File:Destroying Chinese war junks, by E. Duncan (1843).jpg|thumb|A British steamship destroying Chinese war [[Junk (ship)|junks]] at the [[Second Battle of Chuenpi]] during the [[First Opium War]], 7 January 1841]]
Historians have judged the Qing dynasty's vulnerability and weakness to foreign imperialism in the 19th century to be based mainly on its maritime naval weakness, but it achieved military success against Westerners on land. The historian [[Edward L. Dreyer]] stated, "China's nineteenth-century humiliations were strongly related to her weakness and failure at sea. At the start of the First Opium War, China had no unified navy and not a sense of how vulnerable she was to attack from the sea. British navy forces sailed and steamed wherever they wanted to go. In the [[Second Opium War]] (1856–60), the Chinese had no way to prevent the Anglo-French navy expedition of 1860 from sailing into the Gulf of Zhili and landing as near as possible to Beijing. Meanwhile, new but not exactly modern Chinese armies suppressed the midcentury [[List of rebellions in China|rebellions]], [[Treaty of Saint Petersburg (1881)|bluffed Russia into a peaceful settlement of disputed frontiers in Central Asia]], and [[Battle of Bang Bo (Zhennan Pass)|defeated the French forces on land in the Sino-French War (1884–85)]]. But the defeat at sea, and the resulting threat to steamship traffic to Taiwan, forced China to conclude peace on unfavorable terms."<ref>{{cite thesis |last=PO  |first=Chung-yam |date=28 June 2013 |publisher=Ruprecht-Karls-Universität Heidelberg |title=Conceptualizing the Blue Frontier: The Great Qing and the Maritime World in the Long Eighteenth Century |page=11 |url=http://archiv.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/volltextserver/18877/1/PhD_Dissertation_CyPO.pdf }}</ref><ref>Edward L.

The historian Jane E. Elliott criticized the allegation that China refused to modernize or was unable to defeat Western armies as simplistic by noting that China embarked on a massive military modernization in the late 1800s after several defeats, bought weapons from Western countries, and manufactured its own at arsenals, such as the [[Hanyang Arsenal]] during the [[Boxer Rebellion]]. In addition, Elliott questioned the claim that Chinese society was traumatized by the Western victories, as many Chinese peasants (then 90% of the population) lived outside the concessions and continued about their daily lives uninterrupted and without any feeling of "humiliation".<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wWvl9O4Gn1UC&q=chinese+fire+power+pinned+down+enemy|title=Some did it for civilisation, some did it for their country: a revised view of the boxer war|author=Jane E.
