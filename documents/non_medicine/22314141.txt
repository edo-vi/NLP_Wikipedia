'''Equine chorionic gonadotropin''' (acronym given as '''eCG''' but not to be confused with [[ECG]]) is a [[gonadotropin|gonadotropic]] [[hormone]] produced in the [[chorion]] of pregnant [[mare]]s. Previously referred to as pregnant mare's [[Blood serum|serum]] gonadotropin ('''PMSG'''), the hormone is commonly used in concert with [[progestogen]] to induce [[ovulation]] in [[livestock]] prior to [[artificial insemination]].

Pregnant mares secrete the hormone from their [[endometrial cup]]s between 40 and 130 days into their [[gestation]], and once collected, it has been used to artificially induce [[estrus]] in female [[sheep]], [[goat]]s, [[cattle]], and [[swine]]. Despite being less pure than [[pituitary]] extracts from sheep, goats or swine, PMSG tends to be used because of its longer circulatory [[half-life]]. In equids PMSG has only LH like activity, but in other species it has activity like both [[follicle-stimulating hormone]] (FSH) and [[luteinizing hormone]] (LH).

Equine CG, like all glycoprotein hormones, is composed of two dissimilar subunits named alpha and beta. The alpha subunit is common to all glycoprotein hormones (LH, FSH, TSH, CG). The beta subunits are hormone-specific and are responsible for [[receptor binding]] specificity, although CG binds to the same [[Luteinizing hormone/choriogonadotropin receptor]] as LH. In the [[equidae|equids]] (horses, donkeys, zebras), the [[placental]] CGs and pituitary LH are expressed from the same gene and thus have the same protein sequence, differing only by their carbohydrate side-chains (particularly in their respective beta subunits).

==Criticism==
The Swiss-based Animal Welfare Foundation has criticized how eCG is obtained from horse blood collected by inhumane practices in Uruguayan, Argentinian, and Icelandic horse farms, as documented in undercover videos shot there. <ref>{{cite news |title=Wie Pharmakonzerne mit Pferdeblut Geschäfte machen |language=German |trans-title=How pharmaceutical concerns do business with horse blood |author=Boris Herrmann and Silvia Liebrich |url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/wirtschaft/handel-grausamer-bluttransfer-1.2668283 |newspaper=[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]] |date=29 September 2015 |accessdate=9 April 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Pferdeblut in der Schweinezucht |language=German |trans-title=Horse blood in pig breeding |author=Laura-Nadin Naue |url=http://www.mdr.de/kultur/stutenblut-schweinzucht-100.html |publisher=[[Mitteldeutscher Rundfunk]] |date=31 January 2017 |accessdate=9 April 2017}}</ref><ref>
