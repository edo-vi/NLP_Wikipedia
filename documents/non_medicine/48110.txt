'''Tonya Maxene Price''' (née '''Harding'''; born November 12, 1970) is an American former [[figure skating|figure skater]], retired boxer and reality television personality.

Born in [[Portland, Oregon]], Harding was raised by her mother, who enrolled her in ice skating lessons at 3 years old. Harding spent much of her early life training, eventually dropping out of high school to devote her time to the sport. After climbing the ranks in the [[U.S. Figure Skating Championships]] between 1986 and 1989, Harding won the 1989 [[Skate America]] competition. She became the 1991 and 1994 U.S. champion before being stripped of her 1994 title, and [[1991 World Figure Skating Championships|1991 World silver medalist]]. In 1991, she became the first American woman and the second woman in history (after [[Midori Ito]]) to successfully land a triple [[Axel jump|Axel]] in an international competition. Harding is a two-time Olympian and a two-time Skate America Champion.

In January 1994, Harding became embroiled in controversy when her ex-husband, Jeff Gillooly, orchestrated [[Assault of Nancy Kerrigan|an attack]] on her fellow U.S. skating rival [[Nancy Kerrigan]].  On March 16, 1994, Harding accepted a [[plea bargain]] in which she pleaded guilty to [[obstruction of justice|conspiracy to hinder prosecution]]. As a result of her involvement in the aftermath of the assault on Kerrigan, the [[U.S. Figure Skating|United States Figure Skating Association]] banned her for life on June 30, 1994.

From 2003 to 2004, Harding competed as a [[Women's boxing|professional boxer]]. Her life has been the subject of many books, films, documentaries, and academic studies. In 2014, two [[television documentaries]] were made about Harding's life and skating career (''Nancy & Tonya'' and ''The Price of Gold''), inspiring [[Steven Rogers (screenwriter)|Steven Rogers]] to write the film ''[[I, Tonya|I,&nbsp;Tonya]]'' in 2017, in which Harding was portrayed by Australian actress [[Margot Robbie]]. In 2018, she was a contestant on [[Dancing with the Stars (American season 26)|season 26]] of ''[[Dancing with the Stars (American TV series)|Dancing with the Stars]]'', finishing in third place. In 2019, she won [[Worst Cooks in America#Season 16: Celebrity Edition 5|season 16]] of ''[[Worst Cooks in America|Worst Cooks in America: Celebrity Edition]]''.

== Skating career ==
Harding trained as a figure skater throughout her youth with coach Diane Rawlinson. In the mid-1980s, she began working her way up the competitive skating ladder. She placed sixth at the 1986 U.S. Figure Skating Championships, fifth in 1987 and 1988, and third in 1989. After competing in the February [[1989 U.S. Figure Skating Championships|1989 Nationals Championship]], Harding began training with Dody Teachman as her coach.<ref name="Hersh">{{cite news |first=Phil|last=Hersh |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1992-03-04/sports/9201200938_1_diane-rawlinson-dody-teachman-tonya-harding|title=Skater Changes Coaches, Again |work=Chicago Tribune|date=March 4, 1992|access-date=August 5, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180805233735/http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1992-03-04/sports/9201200938_1_diane-rawlinson-dody-teachman-tonya-harding|archive-date=August 5, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> She then won the October [[1989 Skate America]] competition, and was considered a strong contender at the February [[1990 U.S. Figure Skating Championships]]. However, she was experiencing the [[influenza|flu]] and [[asthma]] and had a poor [[Free skating|free skate]]. After the original program, she dropped from second place and finished seventh overall.{{sfn|Prouse|Harding|2008|pages=96–98}}
Harding's breakthrough year came in 1991 when, at the [[1991 United States Figure Skating Championships|U.S. Championships]], she completed her first [[triple Axel]] in competition on February 16 – the first American woman to execute the jump.<ref name=nyt910312>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/03/12/sports/figure-skating-a-triple-axel-with-rippling-effects.html |title=A Triple Axel With Rippling Effects |first=Michael |last=Janofsky |work=The New York Times |date=March 12, 1991 |access-date=December 22, 2017 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20171226224921/http://www.nytimes.com/1991/03/12/sports/figure-skating-a-triple-axel-with-rippling-effects.html |archive-date=December 26, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> She landed seven triple jumps in the long program including the triple Axel.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Lubarsky|first=Jared |date=March 10, 1991|title=Power Skating|work=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/03/10/magazine/power-skating.html |access-date=June 16, 2019|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20190616191555/https://www.nytimes.com/1991/03/10/magazine/power-skating.html |archive-date=June 16, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>  She won the 1991 U.S. Ladies' Singles title with the event's first 6.0 technical merit score since [[Janet Lynn]]'s 1973 performance at the U.S. Championships.<ref name="nytimes.com">{{cite news |title=Harding Takes Singles Title|first=Micheal|last=Janofsky |work=[[The New York Times]]|date=February 17, 1991 |access-date=August 5, 2018 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/02/17/sports/figure-skating-harding-takes-singles-title.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180805234206/https://www.nytimes.com/1991/02/17/sports/figure-skating-harding-takes-singles-title.html|archive-date=August 5, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> She won the long program when seven of the nine judges gave her first place, and won the competition.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|last=Brennan|first=Christine|date=February 17, 1991 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/sports/1991/02/17/hardings-7-triples-nail-us-title-put-skating-world-in-whirl/3e847b63-6d16-4c13-b197-9fed67677fdf/?noredirect=on|title=Harding's Seven Triples Nail U.S. Title, Put Skating World in a Whirl|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|access-date=June 16, 2019}}</ref> She scored eight 5.9s and one 6.0 for technical merit and six 5.9s, one 5.8 and two 5.7s for composition and style.<ref name=":0" /> At the March 1991 World Championships, an international event, she again completed the triple Axel.

At the September [[1991 Skate America]] competition, Harding recorded three more firsts:
* The first ever woman to complete a triple Axel in the short program
* The first woman ever to successfully execute two triple Axels in a single competition
* The first ever to complete a triple Axel in combination (with the double [[toe loop]])

Despite these record-breaking performances, after 1991, Harding was never again able to successfully complete the triple Axel in competition; her competitive results began to decline.

The aftermath of the attack was recorded on a news camera and broadcast around the world. The assailant was Shane Stant, contracted to break her right knee; he turned himself in to the [[FBI]] in Phoenix on January 14.<ref name="anatomy of plot"/> Stant and his uncle, Derrick Smith, were hired for this assault by Harding's ex-husband, Jeff Gillooly, and her bodyguard Shawn Eckardt.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://sportsworld.nbcsports.com/nancy-tonya/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180707093538/https://sportsworld.nbcsports.com/nancy-tonya/ |archive-date=July 7, 2018 |work=NBC SportsWorld |title=Nancy & Tonya |year=2014 |type=documentary}} Tonya telling a reporter "Shawn is my bodyguard" while he walks beside her on January 10, 1994 - time code ca 0:29:14</ref> After failing to find Kerrigan in Massachusetts, Stant had taken a 20-hour bus trip to Detroit.<ref name="Traveling">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/23/sports/figure-skating-traveling-far-and-lying-low-to-get-nancy-kerrigan.html|title=Traveling Far and Lying Low to Get Nancy Kerrigan|work=[[The New York Times]]|first=Joseph B. |last=Treaster |date=January 23, 1994|access-date=July 9, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180710071440/https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/23/sports/figure-skating-traveling-far-and-lying-low-to-get-nancy-kerrigan.html |archive-date=July 10, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Nancy Kerrigan was walking behind a curtain when Stant rushed behind her. Using both hands, he swung a 21-inch (53&nbsp;cm) [[ASP, Inc.|ASP]] [[telescopic baton]] at her right leg, striking above her knee. The attack was intended to seriously injure Kerrigan so that she could not compete in the Nationals (Kerrigan was the defending [[1993 U.S. Figure Skating Championships|1993 Champion]]) nor the Winter Olympics. Kerrigan's leg was not broken but severely bruised, forcing her to withdraw from the Championships and forgo competing to retain the U.S. Ladies' title.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/07/sports/figure-skating-kerrigan-attacked-after-practice-assailant-flees.html|title=Kerrigan Attacked After Practice; Assailant Flees|work=[[The New York Times]]|first=Jere|last=Longman|date=January 7, 1994 |access-date=July 11, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180711055918/https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/07/sports/figure-skating-kerrigan-attacked-after-practice-assailant-flees.html|archive-date=July 11, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> On January 8, Harding won the U.S. title; she and Kerrigan were then both selected for the [[United States at the 1994 Winter Olympics|1994 Olympic team]].<ref name="Traveling"/>

On January 11, Harding was interviewed for [[KOIN|KOIN-TV]] in [[Portland, Oregon]]. Harding was asked whether someone she knew could have planned the attack. Harding replied, "I have definitely thought about it." Gillooly stood in her view behind the camera during the interview. The interview ended with Harding saying, "No one controls my life but me...if there's something in there that I don't like, I'm going to change it."<ref>{{cite news |last1=Bruscas |first1=Angelo |last2=Clever |first2=Dick |date=January 13, 1994 |title=Husband, bodyguard implicated in attack – Police 'close' to arrest in Kerrigan case |newspaper=Santa Cruz Sentinel |volume=137 |number=12 |format=TIFF |url=https://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&d=SCS19940113.1.12&srpos=32&e=-------en--20--21-byDA-txt-txIN-%22tonya+harding%22-------1 |access-date=August 12, 2018 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180813075316/https://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&d=SCS19940113.1.12&srpos=32&e=-------en--20--21-byDA-txt-txIN-%22tonya+harding%22-------1 |archive-date=August 13, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Haight |first1=Abby |last2=Vader |first2=J.E. |year=1994 |title=Fire on Ice |page=99 |publisher=Crown |isbn=9780525575313 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4R06DwAAQBAJ&pg=PT103 |url-access=subscription |via=Google Books |access-date=August 12, 2018 |quote=[Harding said] I just wish people would see that, you know, I'm out there trying just as much as everybody else is, and it's just really sad.

On March 21, 1994, a Portland grand jury issued an indictment stating there was evidence Harding participated in the attack plot. The indictment concluded more than two months of investigation and witness testimonies from Diane Rawlinson; Harding's choreographer Erika Bakacs; freelance figure skating writer Vera Marano; and Eckardt's college instructor and classmates.<ref>{{cite news |first=Christine |last=Brennan |date=January 21, 1994 |title=Bodyguard says Harding knew of plot |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/sports/longterm/olympics1998/history/timeline/articles/time_012194.htm |access-date=July 31, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180127225704/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/sports/longterm/olympics1998/history/timeline/articles/time_012194.htm |archive-date=January 27, 2018}}</ref><ref name="oregonlive.com"/><ref name="Bruscas"/><ref name="pleads guilty">{{cite news|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1994-02-02/news/mn-18226_1_2-year-prison-term|title=Ex-Spouse Pleads Guilty & Implicates Harding|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|first=John|last=Balzar|date=February 2, 1994|access-date=July 7, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180526042504/http://articles.latimes.com/1994-02-02/news/mn-18226_1_2-year-prison-term|archive-date=May 26, 2018}}</ref> It stated there was evidence Harding fraudulently used USFSA-provided skating monies to finance the assault.

On June 29, the USFSA disciplinary panel met for nine hours over two days to consider Harding's alleged role in the attack.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/30/sports/sports-people-figure-skating-harding-punishment-under-consideration.html |title=Harding Punishment Under Consideration |date=June 30, 1994 |newspaper=New York Times |url-status=live |access-date=August 11, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180812054143/https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/30/sports/sports-people-figure-skating-harding-punishment-under-consideration.html |archive-date=August 12, 2018}}</ref> On June 30, chairman William Hybl stated,
: "By a [[Burden of proof (law)|preponderance of the evidence]], the panel did conclude that she had prior knowledge and was involved prior to the incident. This is based on [[Civil procedure in the United States|civil standards]], not [[United States criminal procedure|criminal standards]] ... bank records, phone records – the way they came together to establish a case."
The panel decided that pertinent FBI reports, court documents, and Harding's March 16 plea agreement presented
: "a clear disregard for fairness, good sportsmanship, and ethical behaviour."<ref name="USFSA decision"/>
Harding did not attend or participate in the two-day hearing.

Kerrigan said that she hoped Harding could learn from past mistakes and "find happiness".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/sports/1998/02/08/for-openers-many-eyes-were-closed/2f226bf6-6cb3-422c-9ffe-d1c55790b5b6/|title=For Openers, Many Eyes were Closed|first=Leonard|last=Shapiro |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|date=February 8, 1998|access-date=July 5, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180805233553/https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/sports/1998/02/08/for-openers-many-eyes-were-closed/2f226bf6-6cb3-422c-9ffe-d1c55790b5b6/|archive-date=August 5, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Harding said she was grateful to personally express remorse to Kerrigan again.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/fl-xpm-1998-02-06-9802060057-story.html|title=Harding's Apology Rejected |first=Sharon |last=Robb |work=[[Sun-Sentinel]] |date=February 6, 1998 |access-date=July 5, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180705150853/http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1998-02-06/sports/9802060057_1_harding-and-kerrigan-harding-s-ex-husband-nancy-kerrigan |archive-date=July 5, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>

In Harding's 2008 biography, ''The Tonya Tapes'' (transcribed by Lynda D. Prouse from recorded interviews), she stated that she wanted to call the FBI in 1994 to reveal what she knew, but decided not to when Gillooly allegedly threatened her with death following a gunpoint [[gang rape]] by him and two other men she did not know. Gillooly responded with surprise that "groundless claims" against him could be published and specifically contended her gang rape accusation to be "utterly ridiculous".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.today.com/news/tonya-harding-reveals-her-side-roller-coaster-life-1C9015579 |title=Tonya Harding reveals her side of 'roller-coaster life'|date=May 15, 2008|first=Mike|last=Celizic |website=[[Today (American TV program)|Today.com]]|access-date=July 4, 2018|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170901024350/https://www.today.com/news/tonya-harding-reveals-her-side-roller-coaster-life-1C9015579|archive-date=September 1, 2017}}</ref> In 2013, ''[[Deadspin]]'' sought Gillooly for an interview and he again defended himself against the gunpoint gang rape allegation.

He noted how she was subjected to a "litany of vaguely [[pejorative]] or mocking expressions" associated with "low class" cultural attributes, sometimes due to Harding's personal interests and hobbies. Stoloff theorized that Harding represented an American social class that required interpretation ("the class [[Other (philosophy)|Other]]") as he referenced the [[Anthropology|anthropological]] tone of [[Susan Orlean]]'s 1994 essay "Figures in a Mall," written for ''[[The New Yorker]]''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Stoloff|first=Sam|editor1-last=Birrell|editor1-first=Susan|editor2-last=McDonald|editor2-first=Mary G.|year=2000|pages=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781555534295/page/234 234]–250|title=Reading Sport: Critical Essays on Power and Representation|orig-year=1995|chapter=Tonya Harding, Nancy Kerrigan, & the Bodily Figuration of Social Class|url-access=subscription|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781555534295|oclc=43036842|isbn=1555534309|publisher=Northeastern University Press|location=Boston, Massachusetts|access-date=August 17, 2018}}</ref><ref name="Orlean" />

In writer [[Sarah Marshall (writer)|Sarah Marshall]]'s 2014 essay entitled "Remote Control: Tonya Harding, Nancy Kerrigan, and the Spectacles of Female Power and Pain", she noted the pervasive role of the media in the 1994 scandal: "Somehow, in the scandal's aftermath, the form of the Tonya-bash was able to alchemize even the most chilling details of Tonya's life into tabloid gold." Marshall also examined the role of Harding's "[[tomboy]]" persona in the context of figure skating. She theorized that Harding was rejected by the figure skating [[ethos]] because she did not conform – as Marshall believed many figure skaters, including Nancy Kerrigan, did – to appearing as "beautiful without being sexual, strong without being intimidating, and vulnerable without being weak."<ref name= believermag.com>{{cite magazine |last=Marshall |first=Sarah |url=https://believermag.com/remote-control/ |title=Remote Control: Tonya Harding, Nancy Kerrigan, and the Spectacles of Female Power & Pain |magazine=[[The Believer (magazine)|The Believer]] |date=January 1, 2014 |access-date=December 23, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180805052053/https://believermag.com/remote-control/ |archive-date=August 5, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>
