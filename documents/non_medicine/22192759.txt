==Research==

===AVI-TAC===
The mission of the Accelerated Vaccine Introduction Initiative (AVI) is to save lives, prevent disease and promote health through timely and equitable access to new and underused
vaccines. Together, AVI partners serve to:
* Empower countries to make evidence-based decisions on new and underused vaccines.
* Support successful country introduction and sustained use of new and underused vaccines.
* Contribute analyses and assess impact of GAVI Alliance (GAVI) policies that influence accelerated introduction of new and underused vaccines.
* Ensure sufficient supply of new and underused vaccines of assured quality and meeting  programmatic needs of developing countries.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

The Accelerated Vaccine Initiative Technical Advisory Consortium (AVI TAC) supports the achievement of AVI objectives through its leadership in creating the evidence base, advocating for evidence-driven decision-making, and building platform capacity that can be used to accelerate the introduction of future vaccines.{{cn|date=March 2022}}
