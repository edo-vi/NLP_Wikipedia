{{short description|Bacterial disease of fish}}
'''Enteric redmouth disease''', or simply '''redmouth disease''' is a [[bacterial infection]] of freshwater and marine [[fish]] caused by the pathogen ''[[Yersinia ruckeri]]''.  It is primarily found in [[rainbow trout]] (''Oncorhynchus mykiss'') and other cultured [[salmonids]]. The disease is characterized by subcutaneous hemorrhaging of the mouth, fins, and eyes. It is most commonly seen in [[Fish farming|fish farms]] with poor water quality. Redmouth disease was first discovered in Idaho rainbow trout in the 1950s.<ref name="usgs">[http://www.lsc.usgs.gov/FHB/leaflets/82.asp LSC â€“ Fish Disease Leaflet 82<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311085155/http://www.lsc.usgs.gov/FHB/leaflets/82.asp |date=March 11, 2007 }}</ref> The disease does not infect humans.<ref name="usgs"/>

==Distribution of disease==
Some fish species serve as [[Vector (epidemiology)|vectors]] for the disease and have subsequently spread the pathogen to other parts of the world.<ref name="usgs"/>  An example is the [[fathead minnow]] (''Pimephales promelas'') which is responsible for the spread of redmouth disease to trout in Europe.<ref>{{FishBase species | genus = Pimephales | species = promelas  | year = 2006 | month = December}}</ref>  Other vectors include the [[goldfish]] (''Carassius auratus''), Atlantic and Pacific [[salmon]] (''Salmo salar''), the [[emerald shiner]] (''Notropis atherinoides''), and farmed [[freshwater whitefish|whitefish]] (''Coregonus'' spp.).  Infections have also occurred in farmed [[turbot]] (''Scophthalmus maximus''), [[European seabass|seabass]] (''Dicentrarchus labrax''), and [[seabream]] (''Sparus auratus'').<ref name="usgs"/> It can now be found in North and South America, Africa, Asia, and Australia, as well as Europe.

==Clinical signs and diagnosis==
Infection can cause [[Subcutaneous tissue|subcutaneous]] [[haemorrhage]] that presents as reddening of the throat, mouth, gill tips, and fins, and eventual erosion of the jaw and palate. Hemorrhaging also occurs on internal organs, and in the later stages of the disease, the abdomen becomes filled with a [[Ascites|yellow fluid]] - giving the fish a "pot-bellied" appearance. The fish often demonstrate abnormal behavior and anorexia. Mortality rates can be high. 

A presumptive diagnosis can be made based in the history and clinical signs, but definitive diagnosis requires [[bacterial culture]] and serological testing such as [[ELISA]] and [[Latex fixation test|latex agglutination]].

==Treatment and control==
Several [[antibiotics]] are available for the treatment of redmouth disease in fish. [[Vaccines]] can also be used in the treatment and prevention of disease. Management factors such as maintaining water quality and a low stocking density are essential for disease prevention.
