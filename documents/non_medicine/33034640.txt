'''Embodied cognition''' is the concept suggesting that many features of [[cognition]] are shaped by the state and capacities of the organism. The cognitive features include a wide spectrum of cognitive functions, such as perception biases, memory recall, comprehension and high-level mental constructs (such as meaning attribution and [[Categorization|categories]]) and performance on various cognitive tasks (reasoning or judgment). The bodily aspects involve the [[motor system]], the [[perceptual system]], the bodily interactions with the environment ([[situated]]ness), and the assumptions about the world built the functional structure of organism's brain and body.

The embodied mind thesis challenges other theories, such as [[Cognitivism (psychology)|cognitivism]], [[computationalism]], and [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|Cartesian dualism]].<ref name=WilsonRA/><ref name="VarelaF" /> It is closely related to the [[extended mind thesis]], [[situated cognition]], and [[enactivism]]. The modern version depends on insights drawn from up to date research in [[psychology]], [[linguistics]], [[cognitive science]], [[Cognitive model#Dynamical systems|dynamical systems]], [[artificial intelligence]], [[robotics]], [[animal cognition]], [[plant cognition]], and [[neurobiology]].

Proponents of the embodied cognition thesis emphasize the active and significant role the [[Body (biology)|body]] plays in the shaping of cognition and in the understanding of an agent's mind and [[cognitive capacities]]. In [[philosophy]], embodied cognition holds that an agent's [[cognition]], rather than being the product of mere (innate) [[Mental representation|abstract representations]] of the world, is strongly influenced by aspects of an agent's body beyond the brain itself.<ref name="WilsonRA">{{Cite encyclopedia |title=Embodied Cognition |encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2011/entries/embodied-cognition/ |date=2011 |vauthors=Wilson RA, Foglia L}}</ref><ref name="Tro99"/> An embodied model of cognition opposes the disembodied Cartesian model, according to which all mental phenomena are non-physical and, therefore, not influenced by the body. With this opposition the embodiment thesis intends to reintroduce an agent's bodily experiences into any account of cognition. It is a rather broad thesis and encompasses both weak and strong variants of embodiment.<ref name="VarelaF" /><ref name=":9">{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mmUoBc6JoAYC&dq=Radical+Embodied+Cognitive+Science&pg=PR7 |title=Radical Embodied Cognitive Science |vauthors=Chemero A |date=2009 |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=978-0-262-25808-1 |language=en}}</ref><ref name="Tro99"/><ref name=":1">{{Cite book |url=https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/mono/10.4324/9781315180380/embodied-cognition-lawrence-shapiro |title=Embodied Cognition |vauthors=Shapiro LA |date=2019 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-315-18038-0 |edition=2 |doi=10.4324/9781315180380 |s2cid=240822115}}</ref><ref name=":8">{{Cite journal |vauthors=Wilson AD, Golonka S |date=2013 |title=Embodied Cognition is Not What you Think it is |journal=Frontiers in Psychology |language=English |volume=4 |pages=58 |doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00058 |pmc=3569617 |pmid=23408669 |doi-access=free}}</ref> In an attempt to reconcile cognitive science with human experience, the [[Enactivism|enactive approach]] to cognition defines "embodiment" as follows:<ref name="VarelaF">{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QY4RoH2z5DoC&pg=PA172 |title=The embodied mind: Cognitive science and human experience |vauthors=Varela FJ, Thompson E, Rosch E |publisher=MIT Press |year=1991 |isbn=978-0262720212 |author-link=Francisco Varela |author-link2=Evan Thompson |author-link3=Eleanor Rosch}}</ref>

This double sense attributed to the embodiment thesis emphasizes the many aspects of cognition that researchers in different fields—such as philosophy, cognitive science, artificial intelligence, psychology, and neuroscience—are involved with. This general characterization of embodiment faces some difficulties: a consequence of this emphasis on the body, experience, culture, context, and the cognitive mechanisms of an agent in the world is that often distinct views and approaches to embodied cognition overlap. The theses of [[extended cognition]] and [[situated cognition]], for example, are usually intertwined and not always carefully separated. And since each of the aspects of the embodiment thesis is endorsed to different degrees, embodied cognition should be better seen "as a research program rather than a well-defined unified theory".<ref name=":1" />

Some authors explain the embodiment thesis by arguing that cognition depends on an agent's body and its interactions with a determined environment. From this perspective, cognition in real biological systems is not an end in itself, it is constrained by the system's goals and capacities. Such constraints do not mean cognition is set by adaptive behavior (or [[autopoiesis]]) alone, but instead that cognition requires "''some'' kind of information processing... the transformation or communication of incoming information". The acquiring of such information involves the agent's "exploration and modification of the environment".<ref name="Milkowski">{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dxH7eOEmlC4C&q=%22transformation+or+communication+of+incoming+information%22&pg=PA4 |title=Explaining the Computational Mind |vauthors=Milkowski M |publisher=MIT Press |year=2013 |isbn=978-0-262-01886-9 |page=4}}</ref>

[[File:Dynamical Embodied Model of Cognition.png|thumb|The embodied cognitive model of the mind under which body, world, perception and action are dynamically related with each other]]
Another approach to understanding embodied cognition comes from a narrower characterization of the embodiment thesis. The following narrower view of embodiment avoids any compromises to external sources other than the body and allows differentiating between embodied cognition, extended cognition, and situated cognition. Thus, the '''''embodiment thesis''''' can be specified as follows:<ref name=WilsonRA/> <!-- Dawson mention was removed since the source is unclear and it does not appear in the reference section of this entrance. A deeper search on a "Dawson" does not give any results on a Dawson holding a "narrow" definition on embodiment. There is a Michael Dawson but his inconclusive posture does not give any hints he holds such position (see Dawson, M. (2013, 2020)).  -->
{{blockquote|text=Many features of cognition are embodied in that they are deeply dependent upon characteristics of the physical body of an agent, such that the agent's beyond-the-brain body plays a significant causal role, or a physically constitutive role, in that agent's cognitive processing.|author=RA Wilson and L Foglia|source=''Embodied Cognition'' in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy.}}

This thesis points out the core idea that an agent's body plays a significant role in shaping different features of cognition, such as perception, attention, memory, reasoning—among others. Likewise, these features of cognition depend on the kind of body an agent has. The thesis omits direct mention of some aspects of the "more encompassing biological, psychological and cultural context" included in the enactive definition, making it possible to separate embodied cognition, extended cognition, and situated cognition.

In contrast to the ''embodiment thesis'', the [[extended mind thesis]] limits cognitive processing neither to the brain nor even to the body, it extends it outward into the agent's world.<ref name="WilsonRA" /><ref>{{Cite journal |vauthors=Clark A, Chalmers D |date=1998 |title=The Extended Mind |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/3328150 |journal=Analysis |volume=58 |issue=1 |pages=7–19 |doi=10.1093/analys/58.1.7 |issn=0003-2638 |jstor=3328150}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DxQNhOS8VjQC&pg=PA27 |title=The Extended Mind |vauthors=Menary R |publisher=MIT Press |year=2010 |isbn=978-0-262-01403-8 |language=en}}</ref> [[Situated cognition]] emphasizes that this extension is not just a matter of including resources outside the head but stressing the role of probing and changing interactions with the agent's world.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1cgwUvk3OiIC&pg=PA107 |title=Supersizing the Mind: Embodiment, Action, and Cognitive Extension |vauthors=Clark A |date=2008 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-971553-4 |language=en}}</ref> Cognition is situated in that it is inherently dependent upon the cultural and social contexts within which it takes place.<ref>{{Cite book |title=International Encyclopedia of the Social & Behavioral Sciences |vauthors=Cobb P |date=2001 |publisher=Pergamon |isbn=978-0-08-043076-8 |veditors=Smelser NJ, Baltes PB |location=Oxford |pages=14126–14129 |chapter=Situated Cognition: Origins |doi=10.1016/B0-08-043076-7/01601-6}}</ref>

This conceptual reframing of cognition as an activity influenced by the body has had significant implications. For instance, the view of cognition inherited by most contemporary cognitive neuroscience is internalist in nature. An agent's behavior along with his capacity to maintain (accurate) representations of the surrounding environment were considered as the product of "powerful brains that can maintain the world models and devise plans".<ref>{{Citation |title=A Lazy Brain? Embodied Embedded Cognition and Cognitive Neuroscience |date=2008 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780080466163000141 |work=Handbook of Cognitive Science |pages=273–290 |series=Perspectives on Cognitive Science |publisher=Elsevier |language=en |doi=10.1016/b978-0-08-046616-3.00014-1 |isbn=978-0-08-046616-3 |vauthors=Haselager P, van Dijk J, van Rooij I}}</ref> From this perspective, cognizing was conceived as something that an isolated brain did. In contrast, accepting the role the body plays during cognitive processes allows us to account for a more encompassing view of cognition. This shift in perspective within neuroscience suggests that successful behavior in real-world scenarios demands the integration of several sensorimotor and cognitive (as well as affective) capacities of an agent. Thus, cognition emerges in the relationship between an agent and the [[affordance]]s provided by the environment rather than in the brain ''alone''.

In 2002, a collection of positive characterizations summarizing what the embodiment thesis entails for cognition were offered. Margaret Wilson argues that the general outlook of embodied cognition "displays an interesting co-variation of multiple observations and houses a number of different claims: (1) cognition is situated; (2) cognition is time-pressured; (3) we off-load cognitive work onto the environment; (4) the environment is part of the cognitive system; (5) cognition is for action; (6) offline cognition is bodily-based".<ref name="Wilson2002">{{Cite journal |vauthors=Wilson M |date=2002 |title=Six views of embodied cognition |journal=Psychonomic Bulletin & Review |language=en |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=625–636 |doi=10.3758/BF03196322 |issn=1531-5320 |pmid=12613670 |s2cid=267562|doi-access=free }}</ref> According to Wilson, the first three and the fifth claim appear to be at least partially true, while the fourth claim is deeply problematic in that all things that have an impact on the elements of a system are not necessarily considered part of the system.<ref name="Wilson2002" /> The sixth claim has received the least attention in the literature on embodied cognition, yet it might be the most significant of the six claims as it shows how certain human cognitive capabilities, that previously were thought to be highly abstract, now appear to be leaning towards an embodied approach for their explanation.<ref name="Wilson2002" /> Wilson also describes at least five main (abstract) categories that combine both sensory and motor skills (or sensorimotor functions). The first three are [[working memory]], [[episodic memory]], and [[implicit memory]]; the fourth is [[mental image]]ry, and finally, the fifth concerns [[reason]]ing and [[Problem solving|problem—solving]].

The theory of embodied cognition, along with the multiple aspects it comprises, can be regarded as the imminent result of an intellectual [[skepticism]] towards the flourishment of the disembodied theory of mind put forth by [[René Descartes]] in the 17th century. According to [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|Cartesian dualism]], the mind is entirely distinct from the body and can be successfully explained and understood without reference to the body or to its processes.<ref name="Embodied Cognition">{{Cite encyclopedia |title=Meditations on First Philosophy |encyclopedia=Descartes: Meditations on First Philosophy With Selections from the Objections and Replies |publisher=Cambridge University Press |url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/descartes-meditations-on-first-philosophy/927EEA7B69C89B2F7A59F44721EE4A58 |date=1996 |edition=Revised |series=Cambridge Texts in the History of Philosophy |pages=1–11 |doi=10.1017/cbo9780511805028.006 |isbn=978-0-521-55818-1 |vauthors=Descartes R, Williams B |veditors=Cottingham J}}</ref>

Research has been done to identify the set of ideas that would establish what could be considered as the early stages of embodied cognition around inquiries regarding the mind-body-soul relation and [[vitalism]] in the German tradition from 1740 to 1920.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://brill.com/view/title/32618 |title=The Early History of Embodied Cognition 1740–1920 |vauthors=McCarthy JA |chapter=The Early History of Embodied Cognition 1740-1920: The Lebenskraft-Debate and Radical Reality in German Science, Music, and Literature |publisher=BRILL |year=2016 |isbn=978-90-04-30902-9 |doi=10.1163/9789004309036}}</ref> The modern approach and definition of embodied cognition has a relatively short history.<ref name=":14">{{Cite web |date=2011 |title=A Brief Guide to Embodied Cognition: Why You Are Not Your Brain |url=https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/a-brief-guide-to-embodied-cognition-why-you-are-not-your-brain/ |website=Scientific American Blog Network |language=en |vauthors=McNerney S}}</ref> Intellectual underpinnings of embodied cognition can be traced back to the influence of [[philosophy]] and, more specifically, the [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] tradition, [[psychology]], and [[connectionism]] in the 20th century.

Phenomenologists such as [[Edmund Husserl]] (1850–1938), [[Martin Heidegger]] (1889–1976), and [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]] (1908–1962) served as a source of inspiration for what would later be known as the embodiment thesis. They stood up against the mechanistic and disembodied approach to the explanation of the mind by emphasizing the fact that there are aspects of human experiences (consciousness, cognition) that cannot simply be explained by a model of the mind as computation of inner symbols. From a phenomenological standpoint, such aspects remain unaccountable if, as in Cartesian dualism, they are not "deeply rooted in the physical nuts-and-bolts of the interacting agent".<ref>{{Cite book |title=Handbook of Cognitive Science |vauthors=Gomila T, Calvo P |publisher=Elsevier |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-08-046616-3 |series=Perspectives on Cognitive Science |pages=1–25 |chapter=Directions for an Embodied Cognitive Science: Toward an Integrated Approach |doi=10.1016/b978-0-08-046616-3.00001-3 |chapter-url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780080466163000013}}</ref> Maurice Merleau-Ponty in his ''[[Phenomenology of Perception]]'' {{refn|group=transl.|French: "Phénoménologie de la perception"}}, for example, rejects the cartesian idea that people's primary mode of being in the world is ''thinking'' {{refn|group=transl.|English: "I think, therefore I am"}}{{refn|group=transl.|Latin: "[[Cogito, ergo sum|cogito ergo sum]]"}} and proposes ''corporeity'' {{refn|group=transl.|French: "corporéité"}}, that is, the body itself as the primary site for knowing the world, and perception as the medium and the pre-reflective foundation of experience. {{blockquote|text=The body is the vehicle of being in the world, and having a body is, for a living creature, to be intervolved in a definite environment, to identify oneself with certain projects and be continually committed to them.<ref name="Merleau-Ponty 1962">{{Cite book |url=http://archive.org/details/phenomenologyofp0000merl |title=Phenomenology of perception |vauthors=Merleau-Ponty M |date=1962 |publisher=Routledge & K.

The body also provides the first-person perspective (a point of view) with which one experiences the world and opens up multiple possibilities for being.<ref name="Merleau-Ponty 1962" />

The appreciation of the phenomenological mindset allows us to not overlook the influence that phenomenology's speculative but systematic reflection on the mind-body-world relation had in the growth and development of the core ideas which embodied cognition comprises. From a phenomenological perspective "all cognition is embodied, interactive, and embedded in dynamically changing environments".<ref name=":7">{{Cite book |title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |vauthors=Shapiro L, Spaulding S |publisher=Stanford University |year=2021 |veditors=Zalta EN |edition=Winter |location=Metaphysics Research Lab |chapter=Embodied Cognition |chapter-url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/embodied-cognition/#EnacCogn}}</ref> These constitute the set of beliefs which proponents of embodied cognition such as [[Francisco Varela]], [[Eleanor Rosch|Eleonor Rosch]], and [[Evan Thompson]] will revise later on and seek to reintroduce in the scientific study of cognition under the name of ''enaction''.<ref name="VarelaF" /> [[Enactivism]] reclaims the importance of considering the biodynamics of the living organism to understand cognition by gathering ideas from fields such as [[biology]], [[psychoanalysis]], [[Buddhism]], and [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]]. According to this enactive approach, organisms obtain knowledge or develop their cognitive capacities through a perception–action relationship with a mutually determining environment.

This basic idea of (qualitative) experience as the product of an individual's active perception–action interactions with its surrounding is also traceable to the American contextualist or [[Pragmatism|pragmatist]] tradition in works such as [[Art as Experience|Art As Experience]] by [[John Dewey]]. For Dewey, experiences affect people's personal lives as they are the by-product of continuous and commutative interactions of a biological and organic self (an incarnated body) with the world. These lived (corporeal) experiences should serve as the foundation to build upon.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aAbqAGo5MwwC&pg=PA1 |title=Art as Experience |vauthors=Dewey J |publisher=Penguin |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-399-53197-2 |language=en}}</ref>

On the bases of empirical grounds, and in opposition to those philosophical traditions that belittled the importance of the body to understand cognition, research on embodiment have demonstrated the relationship between cognition and bodily process. Thus, understanding cognition requires to consider and investigate the sensory and motor mechanism that enables it. [[George Lakoff]], for example, holds that reasoning and language, arise from the nature of bodily experiences and, thus, even people's own metaphors have bodily references.<ref>{{Cite journal |vauthors=Lakoff G, Johnson M |date=1983 |title=Metaphors We Live by |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/414069 |journal=Language |volume=59 |issue=1 |pages=201 |doi=10.2307/414069 |jstor=414069}}</ref>

Since the 1950s, encouraged by progress in informatics, researchers began to create digital models of the processes by which sensory input is selected by the brain, stored in the memory, connected to existing knowledge and used for elaboration.<ref>{{Cite journal |vauthors=Stern E |date=2015 |title=Embodied cognition: A grasp on human thinking |journal=Nature |language=en |volume=524 |issue=7564 |pages=158–159 |bibcode=2015Natur.524..158S |doi=10.1038/524158a |issn=1476-4687 |s2cid=4451332|doi-access=free }}</ref> These traditional computationalists views of cognition that were typical in the 1950s–1980s are now considered implausible because there is no continuity with the cognitive skills that would have been demanded and developed by the ancestors of the human species.<ref name=":02">{{Cite book |title=Handbook of Cognitive Science |vauthors=Wilson M |date=2008 |publisher=Elsevier |isbn=978-0-08-046616-3 |pages=373–393 |chapter=How Did We Get from There to Here?

The earlier version of the concept of embodiment in cognition was offered in 1997-1999 by Irina Trofimova who called the experimentally proven effects of embodiment in meaning attribution as "projection through capacities".<ref name=Tro97/><ref name="Tro99"/><ref name=Tro2014/> Some researchers indeed argue that this algorithmic focus on mental activities ignores the fact that human beings engage with evolutionary pressures using their entire bodies.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300208825/intelligence-flesh |title=Intelligence in the Flesh |vauthors=Claxton G |publisher=Yale University Press |year=2015 |isbn=978-0-300-20882-5 |language=en}}</ref><ref name="McGinn">{{Cite book |url=https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/prehension |title=Prehension: The Hand and the Emergence of Humanity |vauthors=Colin M |publisher=MIT Press |year=2015 |isbn=978-0-262-02932-2 |location=Cambridge, MA |language=en}}</ref> Margaret Wilson considers the embodied cognition perspective as fundamentally an evolutionary one, viewing cognition as a set of abilities that built upon, and still reflects, the structure of physical bodies and how human brains evolved to manage those bodies.<ref name=":02" /> The theory of evolution emphasises that thanks to their bipedal gait, early humans did not need their 'forepaws' for locomotion, facilitating them to manipulate the environment with the aid of tools. One researcher goes even further, positing that the multiple opportunities provided by human hands shape people's concepts of the mind.<ref name="McGinn" /> One example is that people often conceive cognitive processes in manual terms, such as 'grasping an idea'.

[[James J. Gibson|J.J. Gibson]] (1904–1979) developed his theory on ecological psychology that entirely contradicted the computationalist idea of understanding the mind as information processing which by that time had permeated psychology—both in theory and practice. Gibson particularly disagreed with the way his contemporaries understood the nature of perception. Computationalist perspectives, for example, consider perceptual objects as an unreliable source of information upon which the mind must do some sort of inference. Gibson view perceptual processes as the product of the relation between a moving agent and its relationship with a specific environment.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/560396 |title=The perception of the visual world. |vauthors=Gibson JJ |date=1950 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston |language=English |oclc=560396}}</ref> Similarly, Varela and colleague's argue that both cognition and the environment are not pre-given; instead, they are enacted or brought forth by the agent's history of sensorimotor and structurally coupled activities.<ref name="VarelaF" />

[[Connectionism]] also put forth a critique to the computationalist commitments yet granting the possibility of some sort of non-symbolic computational processes to take place.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Connectionism and the Philosophy of Mind |vauthors=Hatfield G |date=1991 |publisher=Springer Netherlands |isbn=978-94-010-5559-8 |veditors=Horgan T, Tienson J |series=Studies in Cognitive Systems |volume=9 |location=Dordrecht |pages=90–112 |chapter=Representation and Rule-Instantiation in Connectionist Systems |doi=10.1007/978-94-011-3524-5_5}}</ref> According to the connectionist thesis, cognition as a biological phenomenon can be explained and understood through the interaction and dynamics of [[Artificial neural network|artificial neural networks (ANNs)]].<ref>{{Cite journal |vauthors=Buckner C, Garson J |date=1997 |title=Connectionism |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2019/entries/connectionism/ |journal=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |vauthors=Flusberg SJ, Thibodeau PH, Sternberg DA, Glick JJ |date=2010 |title=A connectionist approach to embodied conceptual metaphor |journal=Frontiers in Psychology |volume=1 |pages=197 |doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2010.00197 |pmc=3153806 |pmid=21833256 |doi-access=free}}</ref> Given the traces of abstraction that remain in the inputs and outputs through which connectionist neural networks carry its computations, connectionism is said to be not so far from computationalism and unable to cope with both the challenge of dealing with the details involved during perceiving and acting and explaining higher level cognition.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/877987820 |title=The architecture of cognition: rethinking Fodor and Pylyshyn's systematicity challenge |publisher=MIT Press |year=2014 |isbn=978-0-262-32246-1 |veditors=Calvo P, Symons J |location=Cambridge, MA |oclc=877987820}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/45844220 |title=Psychosemantics: the problem of meaning in the philosophy of mind |vauthors=Fodor JA |date=1987 |publisher=MIT Press |others=British Psychological Society |isbn=978-0-585-33288-8 |location=Cambridge, Mass. |oclc=45844220}}</ref> Likewise, connectionism's take on cognition is biologically inspired by the behavior and interaction of single [[neuron]]s, yet its connections to the embodiment thesis in general, and to perception–action interactions in particular, are not clearly outlined or straightforward.

By early 2000, [[J. Kevin O'Regan|O'Regan, J. K.]] and [[Alva Noë|Noë, A.]] provided empirical evidence against the computationalist mindset arguing that although cortical maps exist in the brain and their patterns of activation give rise to perceptual experiences, they alone are unable to fully explain the subjective character of experience.

Ever since the late 20th century and recognizing the significant role the body plays for cognition, the embodied cognition theory has gained (an ever increasing) popularity, it has been the subject of multiple articles in different research areas, and the mainstream approach to what Shapiro and Spaulding call the "embodied make-over".<ref name=":7" /> A consequence of this widespread acceptance of the embodiment thesis is the emergence of 4E features of cognition (embodied, embedded, enacted, and extended cognition). Under 4E, cognition is no longer thought of as being instantiated in or by a single organism, rather:{{blockquote|text=It assumes that cognition is shaped and structured by dynamic interactions between the brain, body, and both the physical and social environments.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zB1rDwAAQBAJ |title=The Oxford Handbook of 4E Cognition |vauthors=Newen A, de Bruin L, Gallagher S |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2018 |isbn=978-0-19-105436-5 |language=en}}</ref>}}

==Scope==
[[File:The scope of embodied cognition 06.10.2021.png|thumb|upright=1.35|The scope of embodied cognition and the intertwined relationship that arise between the sciences]]
Embodied cognition argues that several factors both internal and external (such as the body and the environment) play a role in the development of an agent's cognitive capacities, just as mental constructs (such as thoughts and desires) are said to influence an agent's bodily actions. For this reason, embodied cognition is considered as a wide-ranging research program, rather than a well-defined and unified theory.<ref name=":7" /> A scientific approach to embodied cognition reaches, inspires, and brings together ideas from several research areas, each with its own take on embodiment yet in a joint effort to (methodically) investigate embodied cognition.

Research on embodied cognition comprises a variety of fields within the sciences such as linguistics, neuroscience, (cognitive) psychology, philosophy, artificial intelligence, robotics, etc. For this reason, contemporary developments on embodied cognition can be regarded as the embodied make-over of cognitive science offering new ways to look at the nature, structure, and mechanisms of cognition.<ref name=":9" /> Embodying cognition requires the different features of cognition such as perception, language, memory, learning, reasoning, emotion, self-regulation, and its social aspects to be revisited and investigated through lens of embodiment in order to ground its theoretical and methodological underpinnings.<ref>{{Cite journal |vauthors=Clark A |date=1999 |title=An embodied cognitive science? |url=https://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/abstract/S1364-6613(99)01361-3 |journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences |language=English |volume=3 |issue=9 |pages=345–351 |doi=10.1016/S1364-6613(99)01361-3 |issn=1364-6613 |pmid=10461197 |s2cid=3084733}}</ref>

(See "Talk" section of this entrance). -->Embodied cognition has gained the attention and interest of classical [[cognitive science]] (along with all sciences it comprises) to incorporate embodiment ideas into its research. In linguistics, [[George Lakoff]] (a [[cognitive scientist]] and [[linguistics|linguist]]) and his collaborators [[Mark Johnson (professor)|Mark Johnson]], [[Mark Turner (cognitive scientist)|Mark Turner]], and [[Rafael E. Núñez]] have promoted and expanded the embodiment thesis based on developments within the field of [[cognitive science]].<ref name=":10">{{Cite book |url=https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/M/bo3637992.html |title=Metaphors we live by |vauthors=Johnson M, Lakoff G |date=2008 |publisher=University of Chicago press |isbn=978-0-226-46801-3}}</ref><ref name=":13">{{Cite book |title=[[Women, Fire, and Dangerous Things|Women, Fire, and Dangerous Things: What Categories Reveal About the Mind]] |vauthors=Lakoff G |publisher=University of Chicago Press. |year=1987 |isbn=978-0-226-46804-4}}</ref><ref name=":12">{{Cite book |url=https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/M/bo3774967.html |title=More Than Cool Reason: A Field Guide to Poetic Metaphor |vauthors=Lakoff G, Turner M |date=1989 |publisher=University of Chicago press |isbn=978-0-226-46812-9}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |url=https://www.basicbooks.com/titles/george-lakoff/philosophy-in-the-flesh/9780465056743/ |title=Philosophy in the flesh: The embodied mind and its challenge to western thought |vauthors=Lakoff G, Johnson M |date=1999 |publisher=Basic Books |isbn=978-0-465-05674-3}}</ref><ref name=":11">{{Cite book |title=[[Where Mathematics Comes From]] |vauthors=Lakoff G, Núñez RE |date=2000 |publisher=Basic Books |isbn=978-0-465-03770-4 |author-link=George Lakoff |author-link2=Rafael E. Núñez}}</ref> Their research have provided evidence suggesting that people use their understanding of familiar physical objects, actions, and situations to understand other domains. All cognition is based on the knowledge that comes from the body and other disciplines are mapped onto humans' embodied knowledge using a combination of [[conceptual metaphor]], [[image schema]] and [[prototype theory|prototypes]].

The conceptual metaphors research have argued that people use metaphors all over <ref name=":10" /> to be in charge of the conceptual level; in other words, they map one conceptual state into another one. Therefore, research have stated that there is a single metaphor behind various definitions. Several examples of conceptual metaphors from different fields were collected to explain how metaphors relate to other metaphors and often refer to body aspects.<ref name=":10" /><ref name=":12" /> The most common example given to this explanation is when the people describe the concept of love, associating this love metaphor with physically embodied journey experiences. Another example of the language and embodiment of Lakoff and Mark Turner is visual metaphors. Accordingly, they argue that the positioning of these visual metaphors for upright and forward-moving creatures depends on body type and the characteristics of the body's interaction with the environment.<ref name=":10" />

Another study from 2000 focused on the "[[image schema]]" to investigate how people understand abstract concepts.<ref name=":11" /> Accordingly, abstract concepts are understood by considering basic physical situations. Abstract concepts, whose basic physical states are considered, then interpreted by using sensory-motor and perceptual skills. Thus, it is shown that there is a spatial reasoning process that requires using the body even in reasoning over abstract concepts. In this context, the image schema is seen as a conceptual metaphor form. For example, spatial reasoning skills and the visual cortex tend to be used to understand a mathematical concept consisting of imaginary numbers that are purely abstract.<ref name=":11" /> Thus, it has been shown how important the body plays in the image schema as in the conceptual metaphor in the interpretation of concepts.
<!-- Previously existing image regarding abstract numbers  representation will be referenced later on. -->

Another important factor in understanding linguistic categories is prototypes. [[Eleanor Rosch]] argued that prototypes play an important role in people's cognition. According to her research, prototypes are the most typical members of a category, and she explains this with an example from birds. The robin, for example, is a prototypical bird while the penguin is not a prototypical bird which shows that objects that are prototypical are more easily categorized, and therefore, people can find answers by reasoning about the categories they encounter through these prototypes.<ref>{{Cite journal |author-link=Eleanor Rosch |vauthors=Rosch E |year=1973 |title=Natural categories |journal=Cognitive Psychology |volume=4 |issue=3 |pages=328–350 |doi=10.1016/0010-0285(73)90017-0}}</ref> Another study identified basic level categories that exemplify this situation in a more structured way. Accordingly, [[prototype theory#Basic level categories|basic level categories]] are categories that can be associated with basic physical motions; they are made up of prototypes that can be easily visualized. These prototypes are used for reasoning about general categories.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Cognition and Categorization' |vauthors=Rosch E |publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates |year=1978 |veditors=Rosch E, Lloyd BB |pages=7–48 |chapter=Principles of Categorization |author-link=Eleanor Rosch}}</ref> On the other hand, Lakoff emphasizes that what is important in prototype theory, rather than class or type characteristics, is that the feature of the categories people use is a bodily experience.<ref name=":13" /> Thus, as seen in the general of these approaches, it can be said that the most basic feature in understanding and interpreting linguistic concepts and categories is whether the concept or category has been experienced bodily.

The concept of embodiment has been inspired by research in [[cognitive neuroscience]], such as the proposals of [[Gerald Edelman]] concerning how mathematical and computational models such as [[neuronal group selection]] and neural degeneracy result in emergent categorization. From a neuroscientific perspective, the embodied cognition theory examines the interaction of sensorimotor, cognitive, and affective neurological systems. The embodied mind thesis is compatible with some views of cognition promoted in [[neuropsychology]], such as the theories of consciousness of [[Vilayanur S. Ramachandran]], [[Gerald Edelman]], and [[Antonio Damasio]]. It is also supported by a broad and ever-increasing collection of empirical studies within neuroscience. By examining brain activity with neuroimaging techniques, researchers have found indications of embodiment. In an [[Electroencephalography]] (EEG) study researchers showed that in line with the embodied cognition, [[#Sensorimotor contingencies|sensorimotor contingency]] and [[Common coding theory|common coding]] theses, sensory and motor processes in the brain are not sequentially separated, they are strongly coupled.<ref>{{Cite journal |vauthors=Melnik A, Hairston WD, Ferris DP, König P |date=2017 |title=EEG correlates of sensorimotor processing: independent components involved in sensory and motor processing |journal=Scientific Reports |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=4461 |bibcode=2017NatSR...7.4461M |doi=10.1038/s41598-017-04757-8 |pmc=5493645 |pmid=28667328}}</ref> Considering the interaction of the sensorimotor and cognitive system, a study from 2005 stresses how crucial sensorimotor cortices are for semantic comprehension of body–action terms and sentences.<ref>{{Cite journal |vauthors=Rohrer T |date=2005 |title=Image schemata in the brain |url=https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/9783110197532.2.165/html |journal=From Perception to Meaning: Image Schemas in Cognitive Linguistics |series=Cognitive Linguistics Research |volume=29 |pages=165–196 |doi=10.1515/9783110197532.2.165 |isbn=978-3-11-018311-5}}</ref> A functional [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI) study from 2004 showed that passively read action words, such as lick, pick or kick, led to a somatotopic neuronal activity in or adjacent to brain regions associated with actual movement of the respective body parts.<ref>{{Cite journal |vauthors=Hauk O, Johnsrude I, Pulvermüller F |date=2004 |title=Somatotopic representation of action words in human motor and premotor cortex |journal=Neuron |volume=41 |issue=2 |pages=301–307 |doi=10.1016/S0896-6273(03)00838-9 |pmid=14741110 |doi-access=free |s2cid=7423629}}</ref> Using [[transcranial magnetic stimulation]] (TMS), a study in 2005 stated that the activity of the motor system is coupled to auditory action-related sentences.

Along the lines of embodiment, neuroimaging techniques serve to show interactions of the sensory and motor system.

Next to neuroimaging studies, behavioral studies also provides evidence supporting the embodied cognition theory. Abstract higher cognitive concepts such as the "importance" of an object or an issue also seem to stand in relation to the sensorimotor system. People estimate objects to be heavier when they are told that they are important or hold important information in contrast to unimportant information.<ref>{{Cite journal |vauthors=Schneider IK, Parzuchowski M, Wojciszke B, Schwarz N, Koole SL |date=2015 |title=Weighty data: importance information influences estimated weight of digital information storage devices |journal=Frontiers in Psychology |volume=5 |pages=1536 |doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2014.01536 |pmc=4287016 |pmid=25620942 |doi-access=free}}</ref> Similarly, weight affects the way people invest physical and cognitive effort when dealing with concrete or abstract issues.

The work of cognitive neuroscientists such as [[Francisco Varela]] and [[Walter Jackson Freeman III|Walter Freeman]] seeks to explain embodied and situated cognition in terms of [[dynamical systems]] theory and [[neurophenomenology]], rejecting the idea that the brain merely uses representations to cognise (a position also espoused by [[Gerhard Werner]]). There are several neuroscientific approaches to explain cognition from an embodied perspective as well as multiple methods such as neuroimaging techniques, behavioral experiments, and dynamical models that can be employed to support and further investigate embodied cognition.<!-- --Structural change 3:-- Here starts the content from the "AI and robotics" section that was deleted.

[[File:This diagram shows the applications of embodied cognition and artificial intelligence.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|The applications of embodied cognition and artificial intelligence]]
Traditional artificial intelligence involves a computational approach. This primary computational paradigm evolved to the embodied perspective with embodied cognition studies and brought more interdisciplinary research topics to artificial intelligence. Embodied perspective brings a necessity of working with the physical world and systems which came alongside robotics. Robotics are essential for the embodied artificial perspective because computers and robots are different.

=== Perception ===
[[File:Change blindness illusion.gif|thumb|upright=1.35|Example of the "[[change blindness]]" illusion. These two alternating images contain several differences that most people struggle to find right away. It emphasizes the fact that perception is active and demands attention.]]
Traditional neuropsychological research widely acknowledged that when an [[Mental representation|internal representation]] of the outside world is activated somewhere in the brain, it leads to a perceptual experience. Embodied cognition challenges this claim by stating that the existence of [[cortical map]]s in the brain fails to explain and account for the subjective character of people's perceptual experiences.<ref name=":3" /> For example, they cannot sufficiently explain the apparent stability of the visual world despite eye movements, the [[filling-in]] of the [[blind spot (vision)|blind spot]], or visual illusions such as "[[change blindness]]" which reveal apparent imperfections in the visual system'''.'''<ref name=":3" /> From an embodied cognition perspective, perception is not a passive reception of (incomplete) sensory inputs for which the brain must compensate to provide us with a coherent picture. The brain interprets the outside world based on an individual's intentions, memories, and emotions, as well as the environment and the specific situation the individual is in. Perception involves more complex processes than simply receiving inputs (or visual stimuli) from the external world to output actions in response to them. Perception is an active process conducted by a perceiving agent (a perceiver),<ref>{{Cite journal |vauthors=O'Regan JK |date=1992 |title=Solving the "real" mysteries of visual perception: the world as an outside memory |url=https://doi.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fh0084327 |journal=Canadian Journal of Psychology |volume=46 |issue=3 |pages=461–488 |doi=10.1037/h0084327 |pmid=1486554}}</ref> it entails an engaged perceiver and is influenced by the agent's experiences and intentions, his bodily states, and the interaction between the agent's body and the environment around it.

One example of such active interaction between perception and the body is the case that distance perception can be influenced by bodily states. The way people view the outside world can differ depending on the physical resources that individuals have such as fitness, age, or glucose levels. For instance, in one study, people with chronic pain who are less capable of moving around perceived given distances as further than healthy people did.<ref>{{Cite journal |vauthors=Witt JK, Linkenauger SA, Bakdash JZ, Augustyn JS, Cook A, Proffitt DR |date=2009 |title=The long road of pain: chronic pain increases perceived distance |journal=Experimental Brain Research |volume=192 |issue=1 |pages=145–148 |doi=10.1007/s00221-008-1594-3 |pmc=3193944 |pmid=18949471}}</ref> Another study shows that intended actions can affect processing in [[visual search]], with more orientation errors for pointing than for grasping.<ref name=":4">{{Cite journal |vauthors=Bekkering H, Neggers SF |date=2002 |title=Visual search is modulated by action intentions |url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1111/j.0956-7976.2002.00466.x |journal=Psychological Science |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=370–374 |doi=10.1111/j.0956-7976.2002.00466.x |pmid=12137141 |s2cid=11584027}}</ref> Because orientation is important when grasping an object, the plan to grasp an object is thought to improve orientation accuracy.<ref name=":4" /> This shows how actions, the body's interaction with the environment, can contribute to the visual processing of task-relevant information.

Perception also influences the perspective individuals to take on a particular situation and the type of judgments they make. For instance, researchers have shown that people will significantly more likely take the [[Perspective (visual)|perspective]] of another person (e.g., a person in a picture) instead of their own when making judgements about objects in a photograph.<ref name=":6">{{Cite journal |vauthors=Tversky B, Hard BM |date=2009 |title=Embodied and disembodied cognition: spatial perspective-taking |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027708002370 |journal=Cognition |volume=110 |issue=1 |pages=124–129 |doi=10.1016/j.cognition.2008.10.008 |pmid=19056081 |s2cid=15229389}}</ref> This means that the presence of people (as compared to only objects) in a visual scene affects the perspective a viewer takes when making judgements on, for example, relations between objects in the scene.

Another study used the mirror neurons perspective to illustrate the relationship between the motor system and several language components. Because mirror neurons are one of the essential parts of the motor system, researchers compared monkeys and humans in an anatomical framework; specifically, they made the comparison with respect to Broca's area.<ref name="Fogassi_2007" /> Another study concerning the role of mirror neurons during learning via language usage stated that activations occurred in Broca's area even when participants watched other people's conversations without hearing the sounds.<ref>{{Cite journal |vauthors=Rizzolatti G, Craighero L |date=2004 |title=The mirror-neuron system |url=https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev.neuro.27.070203.144230 |journal=Annu.

{{As of|2014}}, literature mainly focuses on the relation between language and embodied cognition on a motor system, more precisely by mirror neuron explanations. This relationship also extends to cognitive capabilities which involve a variety of language components. Studies have examined how embodied and extended cognition can help to reconceptualize and ground [[Second-language acquisition|second language acquisition]].<ref>{{Cite journal |vauthors=Atkinson D|date=2010 |title=Extended, embodied cognition and second language acquisition |url=https://academic.oup.com/applij/article-abstract/31/5/599/132685?redirectedFrom=fulltext |journal=Applied Linguistics |volume=31 |issue=5 |pages=599–6222 |doi=10.1093/applin/amq009}}</ref> The nature of language acquisition extends cognitive capability itself due to the fact that it has multiple components which have embodied representations associated with language processing and provide a ground concept for language.<ref>{{Cite journal|vauthors=Dove G |date=2014|title=Thinking in words: language as an embodied medium of thought |journal=Topics in Cognitive Science |volume=6|issue=3|pages=371–389|doi=10.1111/tops.12102 |pmid=24943737|doi-access=free }}</ref>

===Memory===

The body has an essential role in shaping the mind. So, the mind must be understood in the context of its relationship with a physical body that interacts in the world. These interactions can also be cognitive activities in everyday life, such as driving, chatting, imagining the placement of items in a room. These cognitive activities are limited by memory capacity.<ref name="Wilson2002" /> The relationships between [[memory]] and embodied cognition have been demonstrated in studies in different fields and through various tasks. In general, studies on embodied cognition and memory investigate how manipulations on the body cause changes in memory performance, or vice versa, manipulations through memory tasks subsequently lead to bodily changes.<ref name="Dijkstra & Zwaan">{{Cite book|title=Routledge Handbook of Embodied Cognition |vauthors=Dijkstra K, Zwaan RA|publisher=Routledge|year=2014 |isbn=978-1-138-57397-0|veditors=Shapiro L|location=London |pages=314–323 |chapter=Memory and action|doi=10.4324/9781315775845 |chapter-url=https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/348281/1/Embodied%2520Cognition%2520and%2520the%2520WWWv3.pdf }}</ref> Researchers has drawn attention to the relationship between memory and action from an embodied cognition approach where memory is defined as integrated patterns of actions limited by the body.<ref name="Arthur M. Glenberg" /> On the one hand, embodied cognition sees action preparation as a fundamental function of cognition. On the other hand, memory plays a role in tasks that do not occur in the present but involve remembering actions and information from the past and imagining events that may or may not happen in the future. Glenberg blurs this apparent dichotomy by arguing that there is a reciprocal relationship between memory, action, and perception. Accordingly, manipulations that can take place in the body or movement can lead to changes in memory.<ref name="Dijkstra & Zwaan"/><ref name="Arthur M. Glenberg">{{Cite journal |vauthors=Glenberg AM|date=1997|title=What memory is for|journal=The Behavioral and Brain Sciences|volume=20 |issue=1|pages=1–19|doi=10.1017/S0140525X97000010|pmid=10096994 |s2cid=54494552 }}</ref>

Researchers have also investigated the influence of body position on ease of recall in an autobiographical memory study to examine the effect of embodied cognition on memory performance.<ref name="Dijkstra & Zwaan" /><ref name="Dijkstra et al." /> Participants were asked to take positions compatible or incompatible with their original body position of the remembered event during a recall event. Researchers found out that participants given compatible body positions compared to incompatible body positions showed faster responses in recalling memories during the experiment. Thus, they concluded that body position facilitates access to autobiographical memories.<ref name="Dijkstra et al.">{{Cite journal|vauthors=Dijkstra K, Kaschak MP, Zwaan RA|date=2007|title=Body posture facilitates retrieval of autobiographical memories |journal=Cognition |volume=102 |issue=1 |pages=139–149 |doi=10.1016/j.cognition.2005.12.009 |pmid=16472550 |s2cid=23251779}}</ref> The relationship between memory and body has also emphasised that memory systems depend on the body's experiences with the world. This is particularly evident in episodic memory because this type of memories in the episodic memory system are defined by their content and are remembered as experienced by the person who is remembering.<ref name="Wilson2002" /> Research has also investigated the relationship between embodiment and memory by recalling collective and personal memories indicating how embodiment enriches the understanding of memory.<ref>{{Cite journal|vauthors=Diasio N |date=2013 |title=Remembrance as Embodiment in Contemporary Polish Memories|journal=Polish Sociological Review|language=English |volume=183 |issue=3 |pages=389–402 |issn=1231-1413}}</ref> Embodied memory research through the recalling of personal traumas and violent memories has reported that people who have experienced trauma or violence re-feel their experiences in their narratives throughout their lives. In addition, memories that threaten a person's life by directly affecting the body, such as injury and physical violence, recreate similar reactions again in the body while remembering the event. For example, people can report feeling smells, sounds, and movements when remembering childhood trauma memories. A proper evaluation of those memories and the corresponding physical and physiological phenomena associated with them could describe how those set of recalled memories are embodied.<ref name="Roberta Culbertson">{{Cite journal|vauthors=Culbertson R |year=1995|title=Embodied memory, transcendence, and telling: Recounting trauma, re-establishing the self|journal=New Literary History |volume=26|issue=1|pages=169–195|doi=10.1353/nlh.1995.0007|s2cid=143144859 }}</ref>

New perspectives on the neural structure and memory processes underlying embodied cognition, episodic memory, recall, and recognition have also been explored.<ref>{{Cite journal |vauthors=Wilson M |date=2001 |title=The case for sensorimotor coding in working memory |journal=Psychonomic Bulletin & Review |language=en |volume=8|issue=1 |pages=44–57|doi=10.3758/BF03196138 |issn=1531-5320 |pmid=11340866 |s2cid=8984921|doi-access=free }}</ref><ref name="Wilson2002"/> As experiences are received, neural states are reenacted in action, perception, and introspection systems. Perception includes sensory modalities; motor modalities include movement; and introspection includes emotional, mental, and motivational states. All of these modalities altogether constitute different aspects that shape experiences. Therefore, cognitive processes applied to memory support the action that is appropriate for a particular situation, not by remembering what the situation is, but by remembering the relationship of the action to that situation.<ref name="Wilson2002"/> For example, remembering and identifying the party one attended the previous day is said to be related to the body because the sensory-motor aspects of the event that is being recalled (i.e., the party), along with the details of what happened, are being reconstructed.<ref name="Dijkstra & Zwaan" /><ref name="Lucas M.

===Learning===

Research on embodied cognition and learning suggests that learning could occur and be triggered by perception-action interactions of the body with the surrounding environment. An embodied cognitive approach to child development provides insights into how infants attain spatial knowledge and develop spatial skills that allow them to (successfully) interact with the world around them.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal |vauthors=Mulder H, Oudgenoeg-Paz O, Hellendoorn A, Jongmans MJ |date=2017 |title=Chapter 9 – How Children Learn to Discover Their Environment |journal=Neuropsychology of Space |pages=309–360 |doi=10.1016/b978-0-12-801638-1.00009-4 |isbn=978-0-12-801638-1}}</ref> Most infants learn to walk in the first 18 months of life, which draws on ample new opportunities for exploring things around them. In this exploration, infants learn spatial relations, and by carrying objects from one place to another, they may also learn affordances such as "transportability".<ref>{{Cite journal |vauthors=Gibson EJ |date=1988 |title=Exploratory Behavior in the Development of Perceiving, Acting, and the Acquiring of Knowledge |journal=Annual Review of Psychology |volume=39 |issue=1 |pages=1–42 |doi=10.1146/annurev.ps.39.020188.000245 |issn=0066-4308}}</ref> Thereafter, new phases in exploration may occur through which infants can discover other even more elaborate [[affordance]]s.<ref name=":0" /> According to Eleanor Gibson, exploration takes an essential place in cognitive development. For example, infants explore whatever is in their vicinity by seeing, mouthing, or touching it before learning to reach objects nearby. Then, infants learn to crawl, which enables them to seek out objects beyond reaching distance, learn basic spatial relations between themselves, objects, and others, and get an understanding of depth and distance.<ref name=":0" /> This development of motor skills through the exploration of the physical and social world seems to play a central role in visual-spatial cognition.<ref name=":0" />

Embodied perception-action experience may serve as a tool for learning that extends across the life span, from infancy to adulthood.<ref name=":20" /> Research on the role of action in early as well as educational learning contexts demonstrates the importance of embodiment for learning. In one experiment, three-month-old infants who were not skilled in reaching were trained to reach for objects with velcro-covered mittens instead. Afterward, the assessments and comparison with the control group showed that infants can rapidly form goal-based action representations and view others' actions as goal-directed.<ref>{{Cite journal |vauthors=Sommerville JA, Woodward AL, Needham A |date=2005 |title=Action experience alters 3-month-old infants' perception of others' actions |journal=Cognition |language=en |volume=96 |issue=1 |pages=B1–B11 |doi=10.1016/j.cognition.2004.07.004 |issn=0010-0277 |pmc=3908452 |pmid=15833301}}</ref> Further research indicates that mere observational experience by infants does not produce these results.<ref name=":20">{{Cite journal |vauthors=Kontra C, Goldin-Meadow S, Beilock SL |date=2012 |title=Embodied learning across the life span |journal=Topics in Cognitive Science |volume=4 |issue=4 |pages=731–739 |doi=10.1111/j.1756-8765.2012.01221.x |issn=1756-8757 |pmc=3634974 |pmid=22961943}}</ref> Similarly, research has shown how action and bodily movements can be used as [[Scaffolding|scaffolds]] for learning. A study investigating whether infants at high risk for developing autism spectrum disorders (ASD) could benefit from action scaffolded interventions (reaching experiences) during early development indicates an increase in grasping activity following training. And thus, it provides evidence about the possibility for high-risk of ASD infants to learn and respond to action-based treatment interventions.<ref>{{Cite journal |vauthors=Libertus K, Landa R |date=2014 |title=Scaffolded reaching experiences encourage grasping activity in infants at high risk for autism |journal=Frontiers in Psychology |volume=5 |page=1071 |doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2014.01071 |issn=1664-1078 |pmc=4171992 |pmid=25295021 |doi-access=free}}</ref> Another study investigates how teaching methods can benefit from embodiment and proposes that a professor's movements and gestures contribute to learning by growing students' embodied experiences in the classroom, leading to an increased capacity to recall.<ref>{{Cite journal |vauthors=Sullivan JV |date=2018 |title=Learning and Embodied Cognition: A Review and Proposal |url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1475725717752550 |journal=Psychology Learning & Teaching |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages=128–143 |doi=10.1177/1475725717752550 |issn=1475-7257 |s2cid=149415180}}</ref>

The action-based language theory (ABL) states that aspects of embodiment are also relevant for language learning and acquisition. ABL proposes that the brain exploits the same mechanisms used in motor control for language learning. When adults, for example, call attention to an object and an infant follows the lead and attends to said object, canonical neurons are activated and [[affordance]]s of an object become available to the infant. Simultaneously, hearing the articulation of the object's name leads to the activation of speech mirror mechanisms in infants.

A study investigating the role of gestures in second language learning states that learning the vocabulary with self-performed gestures increases learning outcomes. The enduring benefits continued even after two and six months post-learning. In addition, the same study also investigated the neural correlates of learning a second language with gestures. The results indicate that [[Premotor cortex|left premotor areas]] and the [[superior temporal sulcus]] (a brain region responsible for visual processing of biological motion) were activated during learning with gestures.<ref>{{Cite journal |vauthors=Andrä C, Mathias B, Schwager A, Macedonia M, von Kriegstein K |date=2020 |title=Learning Foreign Language Vocabulary with Gestures and Pictures Enhances Vocabulary Memory for Several Months Post-Learning in Eight-Year-Old School Children |journal=Educational Psychology Review |language=en |volume=32 |issue=3 |pages=815–850 |doi=10.1007/s10648-020-09527-z |issn=1573-336X |s2cid=218595017|doi-access=free }}</ref> Similarly, an [[Functional magnetic resonance imaging|fMRI]] study showed that children who learned to solve mathematical problems using a speech and gesture strategy were more likely to have activation in motor regions of the brain.

These findings indicate that learning with gestures creates a neural trace of the motor system that goes beyond the learning phase and activates when children engage with problems they learned to solve with gestures.<ref>{{Cite journal |vauthors=Wakefield EM, Congdon EL, Novack MA, Goldin-Meadow S, James KH |date=2019 |title=Learning math by hand: The neural effects of gesture-based instruction in 8-year-old children |journal=Attention, Perception, & Psychophysics |volume=81 |issue=7 |pages=2343–2353 |doi=10.3758/s13414-019-01755-y |issn=1943-3921 |pmid=31111452 |s2cid=160013471|doi-access=free }}</ref>

Embodied cognition has also been linked to both reading and writing.

===Reasoning===
Experiments investigating the relation between motor processes and high-level reasoning have suggested that bodily action and sensorimotor experience are linked to various aspects of reasoning.

The role of motor experience in reasoning has also been investigated through gestures. The Gesture as Simulated Action theory (GSA) provides a framework for understanding how gestures manifest their connection.<ref>{{Cite journal |vauthors=Hostetter AB, Alibali MW |date=2019 |title=Gesture as simulated action: Revisiting the framework |journal=Psychonomic Bulletin & Review |language=en |volume=26 |issue=3 |pages=721–752 |doi=10.3758/s13423-018-1548-0 |issn=1069-9384 |pmid=30511231 |s2cid=54587999|doi-access=free }}</ref> According to GSA, gestures result from the embodied simulation of actions and sensorimotor states. Consequently, gesturing while expressing or reasoning ideas shows that embodied processes are involved in producing them. More significantly, gesturing heightens focus and increases activation of motor and perceptual information. Gestures are said to have a casual role in reasoning as gesturing leads to increased motor and perceptual information flow during the reasoning process. This does not necessarily translate into more effective reasoning, as such information is sometimes irrelevant for a specific problem.<ref name="Routledge">{{Cite book |title=The Routledge Handbook of Embodied Cognition |vauthors=Alibali MW, Boncoddo R, Hostetter AB |date=2014 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-315-77584-5 |veditors=Shapiro L |chapter=Gesture in reasoning: an embodied perspective |doi=10.4324/9781315775845 |access-date=2021-10-28 |chapter-url=https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/348281/1/Embodied%2520Cognition%2520and%2520the%2520WWWv3.pdf}}</ref> The effects of gestures on reasoning are not limited only to speakers; they convey information that also affects listeners' reasoning. For example, listeners could produce similar simulations to those of the speaker by attending to the speaker's gestures.<ref name="Routledge" />

More evidence for the embodied role of gestures during reasoning comes from studies on mathematical and geometric reasoning. Studies indicate that gestures and, more particularly, dynamic depictive gestures (i.e., gestures used to represent and show the transformation of objects) are linked to better performance in snap judgment (intuition), insight, and mathematical reasoning for proof.<ref>{{Cite journal |vauthors=Nathan MJ, Schenck KE, Vinsonhaler R, Michaelis JE, Swart MI, Walkington C |date=2020 |title=Embodied geometric reasoning: Dynamic gestures during intuition, insight, and proof |journal=Journal of Educational Psychology |volume=113 |issue=5 |pages=929–948 |doi=10.1037/edu0000638 |issn=1939-2176 |s2cid=228996307|doi-access=free }}</ref> Additionally, the use of dynamic depictive gestures are associated with better mathematical reasoning, and thus, directing learners to use such gestures facilitates justification and proof activities.

Embodied cognition theory has been applied in behavioral law and economics theory to enlighten reasoning and decision-making processes involving risk and time, decisions, and judgment. Research has shown that the idea that mental processes are grounded in bodily states is not being captured in the standard view of human rationality and the link between them could be useful for understanding and predicting human actions that seem irrational. The concept of ''"embodied rationality"'' results from expanding such ideas into law and highlights how findings stemming from embodied cognition offer a more encompassing insight into human behavior and rationality.<ref>{{Cite journal |vauthors=Spellman B, Schnall S |date=2009 |title=Embodied Rationality |url=http://www.ssrn.com/abstract=1404020 |journal=SSRN Electronic Journal |language=en |doi=10.2139/ssrn.1404020 |issn=1556-5068 |s2cid=219357722}}</ref>

The first theory of embodiment effect on emotions is known as [[James–Lange theory]], after 19th century scientists [[William James]] and [[Carl Lange (physician)|Carl Lange]]. They pointed out that physiological [[arousal]] prior events generates a disposition to experience emotions, and so emotions are not just reactions to these events but are also reflections of dispositional body's states <ref name="Cannon 1">{{cite journal|last=Cannon|first=Walter|title=The James-Lange Theory of Emotions: A Critical Examination and an Alternative Theory|journal=The American Journal of Psychology|date=December 1927|volume=39|issue=1/4|pages=106–124|doi=10.2307/1415404|jstor=1415404|s2cid=27900216}}</ref>

The AAT has been investigated in different scenarios and with different types of stimuli such as words and images. A study focusing on the AAT on embodied cognition, for example, examined people's response to positive and negative words presented on the center of a screen by moving them away or towards the center. The study concludes that participants moved the given positive words towards the center of the screen while moving the negative words away from the center of the screen.

The fact that participants are faster at responding to the stimuli with the joystick seems to suggest the role of a crucial embodied component.

===Self-regulation===

The basic idea underlying findings on embodied cognition is that cognition is composed of experiences that are [[Multimodality|multimodal]] and spread throughout the body, not in a way that [[Amodal perception|amodal]] semantic nodes are stored purely in the mind. In line with this idea of embodied cognition, the body itself can also be involved in self-regulation.<ref name=":2">{{Cite journal |vauthors=Hung IW, Labroo AA |date=2011 |title=From Firm Muscles to Firm Willpower: Understanding the Role of Embodied Cognition in Self-Regulation |journal=Journal of Consumer Research |volume=37 |issue=6 |pages=1046–1064 |doi=10.1086/657240 |issn=0093-5301}}</ref>

[[Self-regulation theory|Self-regulation]] can be defined as the capacity of organisms to successfully implement goal-consistent responses despite distracting or countervailing influences.<ref>{{Cite journal |vauthors=Baumeister RF, Vohs KD, Tice DM |date=2007 |title=The Strength Model of Self-Control |journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science |language=en |volume=16 |issue=6 |pages=351–355 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-8721.2007.00534.x |issn=0963-7214 |s2cid=7414142}}</ref> Most people undergo a dilemma when they encounter immediate pains to gain long-term benefits.<ref>{{Cite journal |vauthors=Fishbach A, Friedman RS, Kruglanski AW |date=2003 |title=Leading us not unto temptation: momentary allurements elicit overriding goal activation |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=84 |issue=2 |pages=296–309 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.84.2.296 |pmid=12585805|s2cid=1656906 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |vauthors=Fishbach A, Labroo AA |date=2007 |title=Be better or be merry: how mood affects self-control |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=93 |issue=2 |pages=158–173 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.93.2.158 |pmid=17645393}}</ref>  When facing this dilemma, the body can help augment willpower by evoking nonconscious willpower-strengthening goals that boost people's ongoing conscious attempts to facilitate their pursuit of long-term goals.<ref name=":2" />

In a study, the effect of [[Muscle contraction|muscle-firming]] on donating money to Haiti was investigated. The participants either held the pen to fill out the donation sheet in their fingers ("control conditions") or in their hands ("muscle-firming" condition). Significantly, more participants of the "muscle-firming" group donated money than of the control group. One can therefore deduce that firming one's muscles can help to get over their physical aversion to viewing the devastation in Haiti and spending money.<ref name=":2" />  Similarly, physical or environmental cues signal the energetic costs of action and, subsequently, influence willingness to engage in additional volitional action.<ref>{{Cite journal |vauthors=Baumeister RF, Bratslavsky E, Muraven M, Tice DM |date=1998 |title=Ego depletion: is the active self a limited resource? |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=74 |issue=5 |pages=1252–1265 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.74.5.1252 |pmid=9599441|s2cid=14627317 }}</ref> Studies have also shown that exposure to physical or conceptual thirst or dryness-related cues reduces perceived energy and, successively, decreases self-regulation These studies suggest that embodied cognition can play a role in self-regulation.<ref>{{Cite SSRN |title=Solitary Confinement As a Prison Health Issue |date=2017 |ssrn=3073610 |vauthors=Shalev S}}</ref>

Some suggest that the embodied mind serves self-regulatory processes by combining movement and cognition to reach a goal. Thus, the embodied mind has a facilitative effect. To navigate the social world, one must approach helpful resources such as friends and avoid dangers like foes. Facial expression can be a signal for evaluation of whether a person is desirable or dangerous. Embodied cognition can aid in clarifying others' emotions when emotional signals may be ambiguous.<ref>{{Cite journal |vauthors=Balcetis E, Cole S |year=2009 |title=Body in Mind: The Role of Embodied Cognition in Self-Regulation |journal=Social and Personality Psychology Compass |volume=3 |issue=5 |pages=759–774 |doi=10.1111/j.1751-9004.2009.00197.x}}</ref> In a study, participants were able to identify expression shifts faster when they mimicked them in contrast to participants holding a pen in their mouths that froze their facial muscles, therefore, unable to mimic facial expressions.<ref>{{Cite journal |vauthors=Niedenthal PM, Brauer M, Halberstadt JB, Innes-Ker ÅH |date=2001 |title=When did her smile drop?

Embodied cognition is also influenced by the situation. If one moves in a way previously associated with danger, the body may require a higher level of [[information processing]] than if the body moves in a way associated with a benign situation. The studies above may suggest that embodied cognition could serve a functional purpose by assisting in self-regulatory processes.

In [[social psychology]], and more specifically in [[social cognition]], research focuses on how people interact and influence one another.

In the field of phenomenology, Merleau-Ponty's ''intercorporeity'' {{refn|group=transl.|French: "intercorporéité"}} means that when meeting a person, one initially experiences the other person via their bodily expressions, which has an impact before cognitive reflections.<ref>{{Cite journal |vauthors=Lorelle P |date=2015 |title=L'intercorporéité au-delà du " je peux ": Husserl, Merleau-Ponty et Levinas |trans-title=Intercorporeity beyond the "I can" |journal=Alter: Revue de phénoménologie |volume=23 |pages=245–260}}</ref> This phenomenon is investigated in social psychology and is known as nonverbal synchrony.<ref name="Tschacher2014">{{Cite journal |author-link=Wolfgang Tschacher |vauthors=Tschacher W, Rees GM, Ramseyer F |date=2014 |title=Nonverbal synchrony and affect in dyadic interactions |journal=Frontiers in Psychology |volume=5 |issue=1323 |pages=1323 |doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2014.01323 |pmc=4241744 |pmid=25505435 |doi-access=free}}</ref> Synchrony during social interaction arises spontaneously and is often independent of conscious information processing.<ref>{{Cite journal |vauthors=Tschacher W, Giersch A, Friston K |date=2017 |title=Embodiment and Schizophrenia: A Review of Implications and Applications |journal=Schizophrenia Bulletin |volume=43 |issue=4 |pages=745–753 |doi=10.1093/schbul/sbw220 |pmc=5472128 |pmid=28338892}}</ref>

In a [[Dyad (sociology)|dyadic]] social interaction study from 2014, same-sex participants interacted verbally in "cooperative", "competitive", and "fun task" conditions. The focus of this study was to investigate the connection between the participants' affectivity and nonverbal synchrony. Results showed that positive emotions were associated with positive synchrony while negative emotions were associated negatively. Other findings describe a causal relation between synchrony and emotions with synchrony leading to affect rather than vice versa.<ref name="Tschacher2014" /> In a similar study, same-sex participant pairs were instructed to alternate asking certain questions and to progressively self-disclose. Results show that people spontaneously move together in space and synchronize their movement, enhancing the quality of interaction (embodied rapport). [[Self-disclosure]] and [[behavioural synchrony|behavioral synchrony]] correlate with positive emotions towards another person.<ref name="Vacharkulksemsuk">{{Cite journal |vauthors=Vacharkulksemsuk T, Fredrickson BL |date=2012 |title=Strangers in sync: Achieving embodied rapport through shared movements |journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology |volume=48 |issue=1 |pages=399–402 |doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2011.07.015 |pmc=3290409 |pmid=22389521}}</ref> These two exemplary studies describe how nonverbal, behavioral synchrony of bodily movements influences the psychological experience of the interaction between people.

One aspect of social cognition concerns perspective-taking, which consists in perceiving a situation from another person’s point of view. Two categories of perspective-taking include visual and spatial perspective-taking. Visual perspective-taking (VPT) is defined as viewing a situation from another person’s point of view and understanding how they see the world. Spatial perspective-taking (SPT) involves the ability to access what spatial information another viewer is perceiving, such as the orientation of objects in relation to each other.<ref>{{Cite journal |vauthors=Surtees A, Apperly I, Samson D |date=2013 |title=The use of embodied self-rotation for visual and spatial perspective-taking |journal=Frontiers in Human Neuroscience |volume=7 |pages=698 |doi=10.3389/fnhum.2013.00698 |pmc=3817588 |pmid=24204334 |doi-access=free}}</ref> Accordingly, VPT has two different levels. VPT1 refers to understanding what is in someone else’s point of view; VPT2 entails adopting this point of view and understanding how the world is represented from this point of view. Both levels are grounded and situated, yet it is only VPT2 that is embodied; it is only VPT2 that relies on deliberate movement simulation.<ref>{{Cite journal |vauthors=Pearson A, Ropar D, ((de C Hamilton AF)) |date=October 2013 |title=A review of visual perspective taking in autism spectrum disorder |journal=Frontiers in Human Neuroscience |volume=7 |pages=652 |doi=10.3389/fnhum.2013.00652 |pmc=3792367 |pmid=24115930 |doi-access=free}}</ref> In the case of SPT, research has shown that not only the presence of another person in the position of potential actions on objects leads to SPT in participants, but also phrasing the query in terms of actions increases the number of people who participate in SPT.<ref>{{Cite journal |vauthors=Tversky B, Hard BM |date=January 2009 |title=Embodied and disembodied cognition: spatial perspective-taking |journal=Cognition |volume=110 |issue=1 |pages=124–129 |doi=10.1016/j.cognition.2008.10.008 |pmid=19056081 |s2cid=15229389}}</ref> The embodiment of SPT is also dependent on sex and social skills. Males and people with lower social skills are said to have lower levels of embodiment in SPT as compared to females and people with higher social skills.<ref>{{Cite journal |vauthors=Kessler K, Wang H |date=2012-04-19 |title=Spatial Perspective Taking is an Embodied Process, but Not for Everyone in the Same Way: Differences Predicted by Sex and Social Skills Score |url=https://publications.aston.ac.uk/id/eprint/21241/1/VPT2_IndivDiff_accepted.pdf |journal=Spatial Cognition & Computation |volume=12 |issue=2–3 |pages=133–158 |doi=10.1080/13875868.2011.634533 |issn=1387-5868 |s2cid=14592374}}</ref>

Research suggests that aging affects social cognition and perspective-taking. In one study, four experiments evaluated implicit and explicit VPT as well as executive and social cognition measures in healthy young and older adults. Congruency effect (the detrimental effect of congruency of the alternative perspective on response time and accuracy) was detected in both egocentric and allocentric conditions in explicit VPT1 and VPT2. Incongruencies in VPT1 less influenced older adults. In VPT2, older adults showed a more significant congruency effect and influence of allocentric perspective during egocentric judgment. These results could explain the impairment of older adults in social tasks that rely on perspective-taking.<ref>{{Cite journal |vauthors=Martin AK, Perceval G, Davies I, Su P, Huang J, Meinzer M |date=November 2019 |title=Visual perspective taking in young and older adults |url=https://psyarxiv.com/86kqr/ |journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology.

===Sensorimotor contingencies===
As a part of the embodied cognition theory, proponents suggest that an organism's [[Sensory nervous system|sensory]] and the [[Motor system|motor]] systems are [[Dynamical neuroscience|dynamically integrated]]. This idea is known as [[Sensory-motor coupling|sensorimotor coupling]] which allows [[Sense|sensory information]] to be efficiently used during action. Similarly, the concept of sensorimotor contingencies (SMCs) states that the quality of [[perception]] is determined by the knowledge of how sensory information changes when one acts in the world. As an example, to look underneath an object, one has to bend down, shift one's head, and change the gaze direction.<ref>{{Cite journal |vauthors=Slater M |date=2009 |title=Place illusion and plausibility can lead to realistic behavior in immersive virtual environments |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London. Series B, Biological Sciences |volume=364 |issue=1535 |pages=3549–3557 |doi=10.1098/rstb.2009.0138 |pmc=2781884 |pmid=19884149}}</ref> Proponents of the SMCs theory argue that every [[stimulus modality]] / sensory modality such as light, sound pressure, etc. follow specific rules (i.e. sensorimotor contingencies) that govern those changes of sensory information. Consequentially, since those rules differ between modalities, also the [[Qualia|qualitative]] experience of them differs.<ref name=":3" /> There are multiple examples that highlight the distinction between SMCs of different modalities. An instance of an SMC distinct for the [[Visual perception|visual percept]] is the expansion of the flow pattern on the [[retina]] when the body moves forward and the analogous contraction when the body moves backward.<ref name=":3" /> In contrast, [[Hearing|auditory]] SMCs are affected by head rotations which change the temporal asynchrony of a received signal between the right and the left ear. This movement mainly affects the [[amplitude]] and not the [[frequency]] of the sensory input.<ref name=":3" />

Support for the SMCs theory is brought forward by studies on [[sensory substitution]], [[Sensory substitution#Sensory augmentation|sensory augmentation]], and research on the field of [[robotics]]. Research on sensory substitution and sensory substitution devices investigates the replacement of one modality by another (e.g. visual information replaced by tactile information).<ref>{{Cite journal |vauthors=Bach-y-Rita P, Collins CC, Saunders FA, White B, Scadden L |date=1969 |title=Vision substitution by tactile image projection |journal=Nature |volume=221 |issue=5184 |pages=963–964 |bibcode=1969Natur.221..963B |doi=10.1038/221963a0 |pmid=5818337 |s2cid=4179427}}</ref> The core idea is that sensorimotor contingencies of one modality are transmitted via another modality. Sensory augmentation aims for the perception of a new sense via already existing perceptual channels. In this case, sensory augmentation allows for new sensorimotor contingencies to be formed. In the field of robotics, researchers investigate, for example, how visual SMCs are learned on a neural level with the help of a robotic arm and dynamic neural fields.<ref>{{Cite journal |vauthors=Houbre Q, Angleraud A, Pieters R |date=2021 |title=Balancing Exploration and Exploitation: A Neurally Inspired Mechanism to Learn Sensorimotor Contingencies |journal=Human-Friendly Robotics 2020: 13th International Workshop.

[[File:The Mathematics Imagery Trainer for Proportion.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|The Mathematics Imagery Trainer for Proportion. A tool to help students learn proportion.]]
In a survey from 2020, researchers analyzed several frameworks that bring embodied cognition theory into clever classroom practices for the teaching and learning of mathematics.<ref name=":21" /> The embodied design-based research program identifies and classifies at least two forms of embodied designs: perception and action-based designs. In perception-based designs, the target is a/b concepts such as likelihood, slope, and proportional equivalence in geometrical similitude. The first step in this design involves asking students to use their naïve worldview to judge a set of material presented to them by their teacher, which affirms their naïve worldview. Afterward, teachers provide students with appropriate media and attempt to guide them to build models by following the formal procedure. In action-based designs, learners are presented with sensorimotor problems. Abrahamson and colleagues developed the "Mathematical Imagery Trainer" platform to explore this design. In one particular version of this platform, designed to teach proportions to learners, they moved two cursors with both hands to turn a screen green. The screen would only turn green when the height of right and left hands from the base had a particular ratio. Once learners discovered the strategy to solve this problem, the grid and numerals are added to the screen to shift learners from a qualitative to a quantitative understanding of the concept at hand.<ref name=":21">{{Cite journal |vauthors=Abrahamson D, Nathan MJ, Williams-Pierce C, Walkington C, Ottmar ER, Soto H, Alibali MW |date=2020 |title=The Future of Embodied Design for Mathematics Teaching and Learning |journal=Frontiers in Education |volume=5 |pages=147 |doi=10.3389/feduc.2020.00147|doi-access=free}}</ref>

Overall, embodied cognition has served as a new framework for exploring the learning process and developing new educational practices. The older educational methods are slowly being replaced or complemented by the new approaches inspired by embodied cognition theory.<ref>{{Cite journal |vauthors=Shapiro L, Stolz SA |date=2019 |title=Embodied cognition and its significance for education |journal=Theory and Research in Education |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=19–39 |doi=10.1177/1477878518822149|s2cid=150186367 |doi-access=free }}</ref>

Embodied cognition has significantly impacted artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics; it has contributed to the drastic changes AI has been through over the last years.<ref name=":22">{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xeFtCQAAQBAJ |title=50 Years of Artificial Intelligence: Essays Dedicated to the 50th Anniversary of Artificial Intelligence |date=2007 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-3-540-77296-5 |veditors=Lungarella M, Iida F, Bongard J, Pfeifer R |language=en}}</ref> Insights from embodied cognition have allowed researchers to build more dynamic robots with more fluid and more expressive motions facilitating better performance in complex scenarios.

[[Shakey the robot]] is a well-known milestone in AI; it was one of the first approaches to building mobile robots capable of reasoning about their own actions and performing specific tasks in a determined environment. Shakey had a relatively simple body and followed commands by itself, melding logical reasoning with physical action to navigate in a room. A limitation was that Shakey’s architecture ([[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]]) relied heavily on symbolic computational principles that, consequently, demanded that it iterate through long command sequences to perform a particular action. Thus, Shakey was slow and could take days to complete particular tasks. Besides, Shakey’s performance was constrained by a highly controlled environment.

Embodied AI tries not to overlook or underestimate the "body" when creating AI systems. It poses that future research should move towards systems that incorporate embodied perspectives.<ref name=":22" /> The body as a contributor to states of the mind is seen as more than a mere follower of (algorithmic) instructions. Embodiment is said to shape intelligent information processing because "intelligence is fundamentally a result of embodied interaction which exploits structure in the world".<ref>{{cite book | last1=Polani | first1=Daniel | last2=Sporns | first2=Olaf | last3=Lungarella | first3=Max | title=50 Years of Artificial Intelligence | chapter=How Information and Embodiment Shape Intelligent Information Processing | series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science | year=2007 | volume=4850 | pages=99–111 | publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg | publication-place=Berlin, Heidelberg | isbn=978-3-540-77295-8 | doi=10.1007/978-3-540-77296-5_10}}</ref>

Instances of situated robots include aerial robots developed by companies such as senseFly, which produces fixed-wing autonomous drones for professional use, owned by [[Parrot SA]], and Flyability, which builds drones for the inspection and exploration of indoor and confined spaces. They rely on the research of [[Dario Floreano]]'s laboratory on mini-robots and evolutionary robotics.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Aerial Robotics |url=https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lis/research/aerial-robotics/ |access-date=2022-02-13 |website=EPFL |language=en-GB}}</ref>

Another example of situated robots is [[Atlas (robot)|Atlas]]. Built in 2013 by [[Boston Dynamics]], Atlas is an anthropomorphic robot with a height of 1.5 m and a weight of 89&nbsp;kg that can move with agility and diversity in various situations. The algorithms of Atlas allow for the complex and dynamic interaction between its body and the environment.

=== Clinical settings ===
[[File:Phantom-limb-illusion.jpg|thumb|The experience of [[Phantom limb|the phantom limb illusion]], which occurs after a limb has been amputated]]
The procedures and methods of investigation in clinical neuropsychology have been directly influenced by localization and computational approaches to cognition. These techniques have made numerous contributions to the development of clinical practice. Embodied cognition broadens the scope of clinical practice by providing a more comprehensive view of cognitive processes under both normal and pathological conditions by highlighting the role of the body and sensory-motor experience in cognition. Thereby, challenging the integration of embodied cognitive practices in clinical assessment and diagnosis processes.<ref name=":18" /> For instance, there exist a number of interventions and therapies which are incorporating the ability of the body to influence cognitive states to aid individuals with psychological difficulties.<ref>{{Cite journal |vauthors=Leitan ND, Chaffey L |date=2014 |title=Embodied cognition and its applications: A brief review |journal=Sensoria: A Journal of Mind, Brain and Culture |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=3 |doi=10.7790/sa.v10i1.384 |issn=2203-8469}}</ref> An example is the already established use of behavioral treatments for children’s disorders such as autism.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Child and adolescent therapy: Cognitive-behavioral procedures |vauthors=Ollendick TH, King NJ, Chorpita BF |publisher=The Guilford Press |year=2006 |veditors=Kendall PC |pages=492–520 |chapter=Empirically Supported Treatments for Children and Adolescents |chapter-url=https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2006-12734-014}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |vauthors=Srinivasan SM, Bhat AN |date=2013 |title=A review of "music and movement" therapies for children with autism: embodied interventions for multisystem development |journal=Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience |volume=7 |pages=22 |doi=10.3389/fnint.2013.00022 |pmc=3620584 |pmid=23576962 |doi-access=free}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |vauthors=Vismara LA, Rogers SJ |date=2010 |title=Behavioral treatments in autism spectrum disorder: what do we know? |url=https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev.clinpsy.121208.131151 |journal=Annual Review of Clinical Psychology |volume=6 |pages=447–468 |doi=10.1146/annurev.clinpsy.121208.131151 |pmid=20192785}}</ref> Another example of embodied integrative therapies involves sensorimotor retraining as well as stimulation techniques to prevent, reduce, or release pain associated with [[phantom limb]]s.<ref>{{Cite journal |vauthors=Lenggenhager B, Arnold CA, Giummarra MJ |date=2014 |title=Phantom limbs: pain, embodiment, and scientific advances in integrative therapies |url=https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26304309/ |journal=Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews.

=== Music ===
{{Main article|Embodied music cognition}}
Embodied music cognition is a paradigm that puts forward the idea that bodily interactions with [[music]] significantly affect music cognition.<ref name=":19">{{Citation |title=What Is Embodied Music Cognition? |date=2018 |work=Springer Handbook of Systematic Musicology |pages=747–760 |series=Springer Handbooks |place=Berlin, Heidelberg |publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg |doi=10.1007/978-3-662-55004-5_34 |isbn=978-3-662-55002-1 |vauthors=Leman M, Maes PJ, Nijs L, Van Dyck E}}</ref> Researchers proposed that [[Music and emotion|musical emotions]], [[Music semiology|meaning]], and the feelings evoked by listening to music, are the vehicle for the embodiment of [[Abstraction|abstract thoughts]]. Thus music has a specific [[Cognitive skill|cognitive function]] that allows for this possibility.<ref>{{Cite journal |vauthors=Perlovsky L |date=2015 |title=Origin of music and embodied cognition |journal=Frontiers in Psychology |volume=6 |page=538 |doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00538 |issn=1664-1078 |pmc=4411987 |pmid=25972830 |doi-access=free}}</ref> Researcher have suggested embodied music cognition occurs at two levels: the surface level and the primary level. The surface level includes [[Psychomotor learning|psychomotor]] activities of a music performer, visible bodily reactions to music, and rhythmic entrainment. The primary level of embodied music cognition is the tonal/[[temporal encoding]] of it; it commands the surface level.<ref>{{Cite journal |vauthors=Korsakova-Kreyn M |date=2018 |title=Two-level model of embodied cognition in music. |journal=Psychomusicology: Music, Mind, and Brain |volume=28 |issue=4 |pages=240–259 |doi=10.1037/pmu0000228 |issn=2162-1535 |s2cid=149571276}}</ref>

The research on embodied music cognition focuses on two main trends: exploring embodiment and expanding the concept of embodiment in music. The first trend includes studies investigating bodily articulation and gesturing in relation to music.<ref name=":19" /> Embodied music cognition considers musical experiences from an [[Action (philosophy)|action]] and perception viewpoint.<ref>{{Cite journal |vauthors=Leman M, Lesaffre M, Nijs L, Deweppe A |date=2010 |title=User-oriented studies in embodied music cognition research |journal=Musicae Scientiae |volume=14 |issue=2_suppl |pages=203–223 |doi=10.1177/10298649100140s212 |issn=1029-8649 |s2cid=142008885}}</ref> One can observe that many people move when they listen to music; in many cultures there is no clear distinction between [[music]] and [[dance]]. Through the different movements of the body, it is assumed that people are able to give meaning to music. This perspective is different from the [[Embodied music cognition|traditional approach to music cognition]], which bases musical meaning on merely perception-based analysis of musical structure. Through the measurement of sounds, movement, human physiology, and computational modeling, embodied music cognition is constantly building up reliable knowledge about the role of the human body in musical meaning formation. Embodied music cognition is potentially applicable to better understand the role of music in social interactions. Multiple studies show that children move more synchronously with music when they dance as a group.<ref>{{Cite journal |vauthors=De Bruyn L, Moelants D, Coussement P, Leman M |date=2009 |title=An interactive sound recognition game for primary school children |url=http://hdl.handle.net/1854/LU-762239 |journal=MERYC2009: 4th Conference of the European Network of Music Educators and Researchers of Young Children, Abstracts |publisher=Università di Bologna. Facoltà di Scienze della Formazione |pages=105–106 |hdl=1854/LU-762239}}</ref>

The second trend includes studies that strive to connect embodied music cognition to other research fields such as [[neurology]] and [[psychology]].<ref name=":19" /> For example, a study showed that people who have [[Parkinson's disease|Parkinson’s disease]] and are [[Priming (psychology)|primed]] by music instead of [[Metronome|metronomes beeps]] are capable of both entrainment and [[Executive functions|control]]. The study suggests that using the body to produce timed sequences of action, particularly when music is used as a pacing cue, allows people who have Parkinson’s disease to achieve similar performance levels as healthy individuals.<ref>{{Cite journal |vauthors=Rose D, Delevoye-Turrell Y, Ott L, Annett LE, Lovatt PJ |date=2019 |title=Music and Metronomes Differentially Impact Motor Timing in People with and without Parkinson's Disease: Effects of Slow, Medium, and Fast Tempi on Entrainment and Synchronization Performances in Finger Tapping, Toe Tapping, and Stepping on the Spot Tasks |journal=Parkinson's Disease |volume=2019 |pages=6530838 |doi=10.1155/2019/6530838 |pmc=6721399 |pmid=31531220 |doi-access=free}}</ref>

=== Social psychology ===
The embodiment has also important potential applications in [[social psychology]], where researchers have studied how people's own bodily states influence their understanding and interaction with others. Researchers have provided evidence demonstrating the influence of bodily states on [[Social judgment theory|social judgments]] and [[social behavior]].<ref name=":17">{{Cite journal |vauthors=Williams LE, Bargh JA |date=2008 |title=Experiencing physical warmth promotes interpersonal warmth |journal=Science |volume=322 |issue=5901 |pages=606–607 |bibcode=2008Sci...322..606W |doi=10.1126/science.1162548 |pmc=2737341 |pmid=18948544}}</ref> They described that people's experiences with physical temperature per se can influence their perceptions of and prosocial behavior toward other people, without their [[awareness]]. When people engage in motor movements that symbolized a particular social category, it primes the use of such category in social judgment.<ref>{{Citation |title=The why, who, and how of social comparison: a social-cognition perspective |work=Social Comparison and Social Psychology |pages=33–54 |place=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |vauthors=Mussweiler T, Rüter K, Epstude K}}</ref>

[[Activism|Activists]] have tried to combine social psychology research with principles of embodiment to further their goals. For instance, [[virtual reality]] (VR) has been used in what is called [[virtual reality therapy]] to invoke empathy in viewers. [[The New York Times]] created a VR project to display the experience of child refugees called "The Displaced". By [[Grounding (psychology)|grounding]] users in the experience of child refugees from different countries, this project triggered strong empathy in viewers.<ref>{{Cite journal |vauthors=Shin D |date=2018 |title=Empathy and embodied experience in virtual environment: To what extent can virtual reality stimulate empathy and embodied experience? |journal=Computers in Human Behavior |volume=78 |pages=64–73 |doi=10.1016/j.chb.2017.09.012 |s2cid=28910358 |issn=0747-5632}}</ref> In the "6 x 9" project, Guardian has used VR to replicate the experience of solitary confinement in American prisons.<ref>{{Cite web |title=6×9: A virtual experience of solitary confinement |url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2016/apr/27/6x9-a-virtual-experience-of-solitary-confinement |access-date=2022-02-13 |website=The Guardian |language=en}}</ref> "Notes on Blindness: Into Darkness" released in 2016,  an exploration of the sensory, emotional, psychological experience of [[blindness]] using VR.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Virtual Reality |url=http://www.notesonblindness.co.uk/vr/ |access-date=2022-02-13 |website=Notes on Blindness |language=en-US}}</ref>

==Controversy==

Research on embodied cognition is extremely broad, covering a wide range of concepts. Methods to study how human cognition is embodied vary from experiment to experiment based on the [[operational definition]] used by researchers. The evidence supporting embodiment abounds within the different sciences, yet the interpretation of results and their significance are still disputed and researchers continue looking for appropriate ways to study and explain embodied cognition.<ref>{{Cite journal |vauthors=Raab M, Araújo D |year=2019 |title=Embodied Cognition With and Without Mental Representations: The Case of Embodied Choices in Sports |journal=Frontiers in Psychology |volume=10 |pages=1825 |doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2019.01825 |pmc=6693419 |pmid=31440188 |doi-access=free |s2cid=199465498}}</ref>

===Research with preverbal infants===

Researchers have suggested that [[Child development#Communication|pre-verbal infants]] may be considered an ideal and naturalistic case for studying embodied cognition, especially embodied [[social cognition]] since they utilise symbols less than adults do.<ref name="Daum et al">{{Cite journal |vauthors=Daum MM, Sommerville J, Prinz W |year=2009 |title=Disentangling embodied and symbolic modes of social understanding |journal=European Journal of Social Psychology |volume=39 |issue=7 |pages=1214–1216 |doi=10.1002/ejsp.686 |issn=0046-2772}}</ref> Some researchers have criticised this notion since it may be impossible to know which [[Child development|stage]] of a preverbal infant is supposed to be the "ideal model" for embodied social cognition, as infant cognition changes dramatically throughout the preverbal period. A 9-month-old has reached a different developmental stage than a 2-month-old.<ref name="Longo">{{Cite journal |vauthors=Longo MR |year=2009 |title=What's embodied and how can we tell? |journal=European Journal of Social Psychology |volume=39 |issue=7 |pages=1207–1209 |doi=10.1002/ejsp.684 |s2cid=26888277}}</ref>

Another major issue is whether or not a particular ability reflects an embodied mode of processing. Looking-time, for example, is said to likely be a better measure of embodied cognition than reaching because infants that age lack certain [[fine motor skills]]. Infants may first develop a passive mode of embodied cognition before they develop the active mode involving fine motor movements. Researchers have described how this is problematic in that there is no apparent reason to suppose that the abilities described through looking-time [[paradigm]] reflect embodied processing.<ref name="Longo" /> For the distinction between embodied and [[Computer algebra|symbolic]] modes of processing to be useful in generating testable experimental [[Hypothesis|hypotheses]], it must be clear what sort of evidence could, at least in principle, allow a researcher to determine whether or not any particular [[ability]] is embodied.<ref name="Longo" />

=== Replication crisis and misinterpretation ===
A [[Methodology|methodological]] phenomenon in the sciences is the [[replication crisis]]. Inside the field of embodied cognition, it indicates that certain findings have failed to be reproduced with the same results as the originals. Such studies have in common the embodiment idea that bodily experiences influence cognitive processes that are typically considered as mental. For  example, [[power posing]] which is classified under embodied cognition because it states that having a person physically expand their body increases their confidence, failed to be replicated in several cases.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Eleven new studies suggest 'power poses' don't work |url=https://msutoday.msu.edu/news/2017/eleven-new-studies-suggest-power-poses-dont-work |access-date=2021-12-06 |website=MSUToday {{!}} Michigan State University |language=en}}</ref> Similarly, studies indicating that weight sensations activate concepts of importance,<ref>{{Cite journal |vauthors=Kouchaki M, Gino F, Jami A |year=2014 |title=The burden of guilt: heavy backpacks, light snacks, and enhanced morality|url=http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:11006811|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology. General |volume=143 |issue=1|pages=414–424|doi=10.1037/a0031769 |pmid=23398182 |s2cid=7839454}}</ref> which in turn may affect morality-related variables, has also failed to be replicated.<ref>{{Cite journal|vauthors=Rabelo AL, Keller VN, Pilati R, Wicherts JM |year=2015 |title=No Effect of Weight on Judgments of Importance in the Moral Domain and Evidence of Publication Bias from a Meta-Analysis |journal=PLOS ONE |volume=10|issue=8 |pages=e0134808 |bibcode=2015PLoSO..1034808R|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0134808|doi-access=free}}</ref> Researchers also could not replicate the previous findings claiming that holding a warm cup creates a sense of [[Interpersonal emotion regulation|interpersonal]] warmth.<ref>{{Cite journal |vauthors=Chabris CF, Heck PR, Mandart J, Benjamin DJ, Simons DJ |year=2018 |title=No Evidence that Experiencing Physical Warmth Promotes Interpersonal Warmth: Two Failures to Replicate Williams and Bargh (2008)|url=https://osf.io/mvn9b|type=Preprint |doi=10.31234/osf.io/mvn9b |website=PsyArxiv|s2cid=239572245}}</ref>

Researchers failing to replicate the same results does not prove cognition is unaffected/uninfluenced by the body. There are still plenty of findings within the topic of embodied cognition that are scientifically sound. Some researchers state that many of the failed attempts to replicate embodiment findings are due to [[Priming (psychology)|priming]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=The replication crisis is killing psychologists' theory of how the body influences the mind |url=https://qz.com/1525854/psychologys-replication-crisis-is-debunking-embodied-cognition-theory/ |access-date=2021-12-06 |website=Quartz |language=en |vauthors=Goldhill O|date=16 January 2019 }}</ref> And many cases of facilitative movements of the body due to priming may be incorrectly labeled as evidence of embodied cognition. The pencil-in-teeth study evidencing embodied cognition may be considered the result of priming.<ref>{{Cite journal |vauthors=Strack F, Martin LL, Stepper S |year=1988 |title=Inhibiting and facilitating conditions of the human smile: A nonobtrusive test of the facial feedback hypothesis. |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |language=en |volume=54 |issue=5 |pages=768–777 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.54.5.768 |issn=1939-1315 |pmid=3379579 |s2cid=15291233}}</ref> Researchers could have deduced that the quicker responses to positive sentences by participants engaging their smiling muscles indicated embodied cognition. Opponents argue that the effects obtained during this experiment were primed or facilitated by the engagement of certain facial muscles. Priming (pencil in teeth, lips) may [[Causality|causally induce]] certain perceptual-motor activity that, in turn, induces certain cognitive processes, without the perceptual-motor activity constituting cognitive processing.<ref>{{Cite journal |vauthors=Adams F |year=2010 |title=Embodied cognition |journal=Phenomenology and the Cognitive Sciences |language=en |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=619–628 |doi=10.1007/s11097-010-9175-x |issn=1572-8676 |s2cid=195274237}}</ref>
