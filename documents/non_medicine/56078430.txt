The '''Deep Crustal Hot Zone''' (DCHZ), or just '''deep hot zone''', is a [[Mohorovičić discontinuity|zone]] in the lower [[Crust (geology)|crust]] where hot [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] material intrudes.<ref name="Dynamic">{{Cite book |last1=Annen|first1=Catherine|last2=Zellmer|first2=Georg F. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9YFGGjz1oVsC&q=Deep+Crustal+Hot+Zones&pg=PA2 |title=Dynamics of Crustal Magma Transfer, Storage and Differentiation|publisher=[[Geological Society of London]] |pages=2–256 |date=2008 |isbn=978-1862392588 |accessdate=December 19, 2017}}</ref><ref name="Earth and Environmental Science Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh - volume 97 issue 4 - The sources of granitic melt in Deep Hot Zones">{{cite journal|first1=Catherine |last1=Annen|first2=Jonathan D. |last2=Blundy |first3=R.

This hot material generates a new, more evolved melt in this area of the crust, which may collect and migrate upwards towards the upper crust. Here, it would collect in a [[magma chamber]] and later erupt.<ref name="Dynamic"/>

The upper crust consists mainly of evolved, intermediate to silicic magmatic rocks.<ref>Gómez-Tuena, A. Straub, S. M., Zellmer, G. F..

== Dynamics ==
The hot mantle material is intruded in the form of a [[mafic]] [[sill (geology)|sill]]. Sills of molten material are emplaced in the much cooler crust, so it quickly cools down and solidifies. Differentiation of the sill occurs, since the more [[felsic]] components stay molten for longer. Furthermore, as in the [[Torres del Paine Sill Complex]], the differentiation probably already occurs when the magma is ascending towards the sill and not within the sill itself. At the same time, the crust heats up and starts partially melting. A composite melt is formed, with parts from crustal partial melting and from differentiation of mantle material.<ref>Dosseto, Anthony. Turner, Simon. Van-Orman, James. [https://books.google.com/books?id=BnYHV5dSpmAC&dq=Deep+Crustal+Hot+Zones&pg=PA249 Timescales of Magmatic Processes], 207-251, [[John Wiley & Sons]], 2011, {{ISBN|1444332600}}</ref>

To migrate upwards, enough melt needs to accumulate so it becomes mobile. Whenever there is not enough melt, the rock is more a crystalline mush, where melt is formed around [[grain boundaries]]. Once the melt fraction, the part of the rock which consists of liquid, reaches a certain value, the melt will be mobile enough to migrate upwards. This value is called the Solid-to-Liquid Transition (SLT) and has a value between 0.4 and 0.6.<ref name = "RosenbergHandy">{{cite journal|last1=Rosenberg|first1=C.L.|last2=Handy|first2=M.R.|title=Experimental deformation of partially melted granite revisited: implications for the continental crust.|journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters|date=2005|volume=23|pages=19–28|doi=10.1111/j.1525-1314.2005.00555.x|doi-access=free}}</ref>

Melt forms an interconnected network along grain boundaries at melt fractions larger than 0.01.<ref name = "RosenbergHandy" /> This means that at this point, melt can start to slowly move upwards. It collects in layers on the top of the mantle intrusions or just above it. It forms layers here since the overlying portion of the crust is much cooler than the hot zone where hot mantle material is continuously intruded. Thus, the melt cools down on the top of the layer until it approaches its [[solidus (chemistry)|solidus]]. Once it comes close enough, it cannot move upwards any more and forms a stagnant layer.

Melt keeps gathering in these layers until the solid-to-liquid transition is reached and the melt migrates upwards again. The melt uses local features like dikes and faults to migrate towards the surface.<ref>Heather, K.B., Percival, J. A., Moser, D., Bleeker, W.

From [[Numerical modeling (geology)|numerical models]], it is found that formation of magma which can migrate towards the upper crust occurs at a depth of about 30 km. It takes between 10,000 years and 1 million years to form the magma,<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Solano|first1=J.M.S.|last2=Jackson|first2=M.D.|last3=Sparks|first3=R.S.J.|last4=Blundy|first4=J.D.|last5=Annen|first5=C.|title=Melt segregation in Deep Crustal Hot Zones: a Mechanism for Chemical Differentiation, Crustal Assimilation and the Formation of Evolved Magmas|journal=Journal of Petrology|date=2012|volume=53|issue=10|pages=1999–2026|doi=10.1093/petrology/egs041|doi-access=free}}</ref> depending on the emplacement rate of the mantle material. The emplacement rates in volcanic arc settings can vary between 2 and 20 mm/year.

== Chemistry ==
The melt that is formed will consist partly of crustal material and partly of mantle material. It will have the chemical signatures of both crustal and mantle material. Because the melt consists of reworked mantle material and remolten crustal material, it will be more evolved than the mantle material that intruded.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Annen|first1=C.|last2=Blundy|first2=J.D.|last3=Sparks|first3=R.S.J.|title=The Genesis of Intermediate and Silicic Magmas in Deep Crustal Hot Zones|journal=Journal of Petrology|date=2006|volume=47|issue=3|pages=505–539|doi=10.1093/petrology/egi084|doi-access=free}}</ref> The material that will migrate upwards is expected to be mostly [[rhyolitic]].
