=== Intelligent systems ===
[[Intelligence]] is conventionally defined in terms of goal-achieving,<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal |last1=Doctor |first1=Thomas |last2=Witkowski |first2=Olaf |last3=Solomonova |first3=Elizaveta |last4=Duane |first4=Bill |last5=Levin |first5=Michael |date=May 2022 |title=Biology, Buddhism, and AI: Care as the Driver of Intelligence |journal=Entropy |language=en |volume=24 |issue=5 |pages=710 |doi=10.3390/e24050710 |issn=1099-4300 |pmc=9140411 |pmid=35626593|bibcode=2022Entrp..24..710D |doi-access=free }}</ref> problem-solving,<ref>{{Cite web |title=What is IQ? {{!}} Mensa International |url=https://www.mensa.org/iq/what-iq |access-date=2023-02-02 |website=www.mensa.org}}</ref> or pattern-recognizing<ref>{{Cite web |title=Understanding Intelligence |url=https://spectrum.mit.edu/fall-2009/understanding-intelligence/ |access-date=2023-02-02 |website=MIT Spectrum |language=en-US}}</ref> capability. Recent development in [[machine learning]] gives rise to systems that can attempt to emulate those intelligent behaviours.

=== Sentient beings ===
{{See also|Philosophy of artificial intelligence|Philosophy of mind}}
One major Buddhist goal is to remove suffering for all [[Sentient beings (Buddhism)|sentient beings]], also known as the [[Bodhisattva vow]].<ref name=":2">{{Cite web |title=四弘誓願 (丁福保) |url=http://buddhaspace.org/dict/dfb/data/%25E5%259B%259B%25E5%25BC%2598%25E8%25AA%2593%25E9%25A1%2598.html |access-date=2023-02-02 |website=buddhaspace.org}}</ref> One question for Buddhist analysis of AI may concern how to relate principles to artificial systems that have been deemed sentient beings or how to develop such systems in ways that relate to Buddhist concepts.<ref name=":0" />
== Buddhist principles in AI system design ==

=== Somparn Promta and Kenneth Einar Himma ===
Scholars Somparn Promta and Kenneth Einar Himma have said that, for Buddhists, the advancement of artificial intelligence can only be instrumentally good, not good a priori.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Promta |first1=Somparn |last2=Einar Himma |first2=Kenneth |date=2008-01-01 |editor-last=Himma |editor-first=Ken |editor2-last=Hongladarom |editor2-first=Soraj |title=Artificial intelligence in Buddhist perspective |url=https://doi.org/10.1108/14779960810888374 |journal=Journal of Information, Communication and Ethics in Society |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=172–187 |doi=10.1108/14779960810888374 |issn=1477-996X}}</ref> Perhaps, then, the main tasks of AI designers and developers may be two-fold: to set ethical and pragmatic goals for AI systems, and to fulfil the goals with AI in morally permissible manners. Promta and Himma say that applying Buddhist principles to accomplish these tasks may be possible and practical.

Prompta and Himmar say there are two prima-facie goals for creating artificially intelligent systems. The first goal is to create these systems, in such a way that maximally fulfils our crude sensory desires and worldly instincts of survival, just as we did for designing other tools in general. S. Promta et al. maintains that, it is possible that the majority of AI developers implicitly pursue this goal when they design AI machines, as can be observed by their over-scrutiny of superficial technicalities of these machines, instead of their wider functionalities. <ref name=":3">{{Cite journal |last1=Promta |first1=Somparn |last2=Einar Himma |first2=Kenneth |date=2008-06-27 |editor-last=Himma |editor-first=Ken |title=Artificial intelligence in Buddhist perspective |url=https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/14779960810888374/full/html |journal=Journal of Information, Communication and Ethics in Society |language=en |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=172–187 |doi=10.1108/14779960810888374 |issn=1477-996X}}</ref> The second goal, on the other hand, is to transcend these desires and  instincts. According to Buddhism, this goal is more worth pursuing than the former one. In ''[[Brahmajāla Sutta]]'', the Buddha holds that sensuality, as well as the beliefs and instincts they induce, are what confines beings to suffering. <ref>{{Cite book |url=https://deerpark.app/reader/N0004 |title=長部經典（卷1） |language=zh-TW}}</ref> Expounding his [[Four Noble Truths|four noble truths]] ([[Pali]]: ''cattāri ariyasaccāni'') in ''minor Malunkya Sutta'', the Buddha also takes eliminating suffering to be the first priority of human life. <ref>{{Cite book |url=https://deerpark.app/reader/N0005 |title=中部經典（卷7） |language=zh-TW}}</ref><ref name=":3" /> The Buddhists then conclude that we can not only reduce, but also eliminate all suffering by transcending and overcoming our instincts of survival, and S. Promta et al. see the potential of how artificial intelligence can help us achieving this. <ref name=":3" />

=== Thomas Doctor, Olaf Witkowski, Elizaveta Solomonova, Bill Duane, Michael Levin ===
Inspired by the Bodhisattva vow, Thomas Doctor, Olaf Witkowski, Elizaveta Solomonova, Bill Duane, and Michael Levin proposed the slogan <nowiki>''intelligence as care''</nowiki> to try revising the current convention of defining intelligence. <ref name=":0" /> It then follows that, one proposal for improving the current AI system design is to use Bodhisattva vow as a guiding principle for setting AI design goals. Generally, Bodhisattva vow has four components; upon taking the vow, one makes a strong commitment ([[Pali]]: ''[[Adhiṭṭhāna]]'') to achieve the following: 

* to liberate all beings (from suffering), which are boundless; 
* to extirpate all suffering, which are countless; 
* to be established in all techniques of practicing [[Dharma]] ([[Pali]]: ''dhammakkhandha'',  [[Sanskrit]]: ''dharmaskandha''), which are endless; 
* to experience the ultimate and highest [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|enlightenment]] ([[Sanskrit]]: अनुत्तर सम्यक् सम्बोधि, Romanized: ''anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi''). <ref name=":2" /> 

In essence, T. Doctor et al. defined the Bodhisattva vow as a formal commitment to exercise infinite ''Care'', to alleviate all stress, suffering, or [[Duḥkha]], for all sentient beings: "for the sake of all sentient life, I shall achieve awakening."<ref name=":0" />

=== Generally ===
Generally, some believe that, from the [[nonviolence]] principle of Buddhism, artificial intelligence should not be used to cause harm.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web |title=What Buddhism can do for AI ethics |url=https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/01/06/1015779/what-buddhism-can-do-ai-ethics/ |access-date=2022-12-17 |website=MIT Technology Review |language=en}}</ref>

== Notable Buddhism-inspired AI instantiations ==
While exploring the possibilities of realizing spiritual figures digitally, P. Pataranutaporn et al. implemented a chatbot, named <nowiki>''Buddha bot''</nowiki>, as an AI embodiment of [[the Buddha]]. It allows users to ask it questions and have conversations with it. It uses [[machine learning]] concepts to process languages and give responses.<ref>{{Citation |last1=Pataranutaporn |first1=Pat |title=Buddha Bot: The Exploration of Embodied Spiritual Machine in Chatbot |date=2019-10-10 |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-32523-7_42 |work=Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing |pages=589–595 |place=Cham |publisher=Springer International Publishing |isbn=978-3-030-32522-0 |access-date=2022-12-17 |last2=Ngamarunchot |first2=Bank |last3=Chaovavanich |first3=Korakot |last4=Chatwiriyachai |first4=Sornchai |last5=Ngamkajornwiwat |first5=Potiwat |last6=Ninyawee |first6=Nutchanon |last7=Surareungchai |first7=Werasak|doi=10.1007/978-3-030-32523-7_42 |s2cid=210357752 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=2017-12-16 |title=Buddha Bot |url=https://freaklab.org/projects/buddha-bot/ |access-date=2022-12-17 |website=FREAK lab |language=en-US}}</ref>

In 2017, a funeral service began using <nowiki>''</nowiki>[[Pepper (robot)|Pepper]]", a semi-humanoid robot that was created by Japanese manufacturer Softbank Robotics. Notable for its capability of discerning human emotions and recognizing facial expressions, it mainly provides funeral services and preaches Buddhist teachings to people.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Gould|first1=Hannah |last2=Walters |first2=Holly |date=2020-10-28 |title=Bad Buddhists, Good Robots: Techno-Salvationist Designs for Nirvana |journal=Journal of Global Buddhism|volume=21 |url=https://zenodo.org/record/4147487 |language=en |doi=10.5281/ZENODO.4147487}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=2017-08-23 |title=The future of funerals?
