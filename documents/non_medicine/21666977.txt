The '''AI effect''' occurs when onlookers discount the behavior of an [[artificial intelligence]] program by arguing that it is not "real" intelligence.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=A Brief History of Artificial Intelligence: On the Past, Present, and Future of Artificial Intelligence|first1=Michael|last1=Haenlein|first2=Andreas|last2=Kaplan|date=2019|journal=[[California Management Review]]|volume=61|issue=4|pages=5–14|doi=10.1177/0008125619864925|s2cid=199866730}}</ref>

Author [[Pamela McCorduck]] writes: "It's part of the history of the field of artificial intelligence that every time somebody figured out how to make a computer do something—play good checkers, solve simple but relatively informal problems—there was a chorus of critics to say, 'that's not thinking'."<ref>{{Harvnb|McCorduck|2004|p=204}}</ref> Researcher [[Rodney Brooks]] complains: "Every time we figure out a piece of it, it stops being magical; we say, 'Oh, that's just a computation.'"<ref>{{cite magazine| first=Jennifer | last =Kahn | title=It's Alive | url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/10.03/everywhere.html | magazine= [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] | volume =10 | issue=30 | access-date=24 Aug 2008 |date=March 2002}}</ref>

==Definition==
"The AI effect" is that line of thinking, the tendency to redefine AI to mean: "AI is anything that has not been done yet." This is the common public misperception, that as soon as AI successfully solves a problem, that solution method is no longer within the domain of AI. Geist credits [[John McCarthy (computer scientist)|John McCarthy]] giving this phenomenon its name, the "AI effect".<ref name = atomic> {{ Cite journal | year = 2016 | publisher = [[Taylor & Francis]] | id = [[Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists]] | journal = [[Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists]] | volume = 72 | issue = 5: The psychology of doom | url = https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00963402.2016.1216672 | title = It's already too late to stop the AI arms race—We must manage it instead | first = Edward | last = Geist | pages = 318–321  | s2cid = 151967826 | doi = 10.1080/00963402.2016.1216672 | bibcode = 2016BuAtS..72e.318G }} </ref>

McCorduck calls it an "odd paradox" that "practical AI successes, computational programs that actually achieved intelligent behavior, were soon assimilated into whatever application domain they were found to be useful in, and became silent partners alongside other problem-solving approaches, which left AI researchers to deal only with the 'failures', the tough nuts that couldn't yet be cracked."<ref>{{Harvnb|McCorduck|2004|p=423}}</ref> It is an example of moving the goalposts.<ref name = "Criterion"> {{ Cite journal | year = 2023 | publisher = [[Springer Science and Business Media LLC]] | journal = [[AI & Society]] | issn = 0951-5666 | doi = 10.1007/s00146-023-01695-0 | last = Nadin | first = Mihai | title = Intelligence at any price?

When problems have not yet been formalised, they can still be characterised by a [[model of computation]] that includes [[human computation]]. The computational burden of a problem is split between a computer and a human: one part is solved by computer and the other part solved by a human. This formalisation is referred to as a [[AI complete#Formalisation|human-assisted Turing machine]].<ref>Dafna Shahaf and Eyal Amir (2007) [https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20070824040343/http://www.cs.uiuc.edu/~eyal/papers/ai-complete-commonsense07.pdf Towards a theory of AI completeness].

According to [[Stottler Henke]], "The great practical benefits of AI applications and even the existence of AI in many software products go largely unnoticed by many despite the already widespread use of AI techniques in software.

[[Marvin Minsky]] writes "This paradox resulted from the fact that whenever an AI research project made a useful new discovery, that product usually quickly spun off to form a new scientific or commercial specialty with its own distinctive name.

== Legacy of the AI winter ==
{{Main|AI winter}}

Many AI researchers find that they can get more funding and sell more software if they avoid the bad name of "artificial intelligence" and instead pretend their work has nothing to do with intelligence at all. This was especially true in the early 1990s, during the second "[[AI winter]]".

Patty Tascarella writes: "Some believe the word 'robotics' actually carries a stigma that hurts a company's chances at funding."<ref>{{cite news

== Saving a place for humanity at the top of the chain of being ==
[[Michael Kearns (computer scientist)|Michael Kearns]] suggests that "people subconsciously are trying to preserve for themselves some special role in the universe".<ref>{{cite news

By discounting artificial intelligence people can continue to feel unique and special. Kearns argues that the change in perception known as the AI effect can be traced to the ''mystery'' being removed from the system. In being able to trace the cause of events implies that it's a form of automation rather than intelligence.

A related effect has been noted in the history of [[animal cognition]] and in [[consciousness]] studies, where every time a capacity formerly thought as uniquely human is discovered in animals, (e.g. the [[Tool use by animals|ability to make tools]], or passing the [[mirror test]]), the overall importance of that capacity is deprecated.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

[[Herbert A. Simon]], when asked about the lack of AI's press coverage at the time, said, "What made AI different was that the very idea of it arouses a real fear and hostility in some human breasts. So you are getting very strong emotional reactions. But that's okay. We'll live with that."<ref>
