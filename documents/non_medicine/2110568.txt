The term was originally used in French literary studies to 'designate a phenomenon characteristic of the age of mass communications - the fantastic spread of a mass literature', and as early as 1970 a special collection of critical articles on paraliterature appeared in France.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kantorovich|first=Vladimir|date=1974|title=The Cultivation of Artistic Taste|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.2753/RSL1061-1975100388|journal=Soviet Studies in Literature|language=en|volume=10|issue=3|pages=88–116|doi=10.2753/RSL1061-1975100388|issn=0038-5875}}</ref><sup>:95-96</sup> Art critic and scholar [[Rosalind E.

On the term "paraliterature", [[Ursula K. Le Guin]] commented that "it exists. What I'm saying is that I don't want to ''perpetuate'' this division. So I would always put it in quotes, or do something to show that I'm rejecting a word that I have to use".<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XJHVjH2hz50C|title=Conversations with Ursula K.
