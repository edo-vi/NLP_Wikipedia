'''Pin firing''', also known as '''thermocautery''',<ref name=obsolete/> is the treatment of an injury to a [[horse]]'s leg, by burning, freezing, or dousing it with acid or [[causticity|caustic]] chemicals.<ref name=obsolete>[http://www.thoroughbredtimes.com/horse-health/2006/november/21/pinfiring-proves-obsolete.aspx "Pinfiring proves obsolete"], ''Thoroughbred Times'', Brian Nielsen and Jessica Fattal, November 21, 2006</ref> This is supposed to induce a counter-irritation and speed and/or improve healing. This treatment is used more often on [[racehorse]]s than on other performance horses. It is sometimes used in the treatment of bucked shins or splint, curb, or chronic [[bowed tendon]]s.<ref name="horse">{{cite web |author1=Clyde Johnson, VMD |title=Pin Firing |url=http://www.thehorse.com/ViewArticle.aspx?ID=2783 |website=The Horse |access-date=3 June 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306023744/http://www.thehorse.com/ViewArticle.aspx?ID=2783 |archive-date=6 March 2012}}</ref> There was also the theory that it would "toughen" the leg of the horse. This treatment is prevalent in equine [[veterinary]] books published in the early 20th century; however, many present-day veterinarians and horse owners consider it barbaric and a cruel form of treatment.<ref name="time">{{cite web |url=http://www.thoroughbredtimes.com/horse-health/2000/October/21/Pin-firing-A-needless-pain.aspx |title=Pin firing: A needless pain|work=Thoroughbred Times (October 2000) |accessdate=April 29, 2009}}</ref> It is not generally taught in veterinary schools today.<ref name="horse"/>
