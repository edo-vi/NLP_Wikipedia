==Etymology==
''Draksha'' is the Sanskrit word for grape.<ref name="thakkur1974" /> "Asava" means "distillate", "juice" or "extract".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=Asava&script=&direction=SE&link=yes|title = Sanskrit - Asien.net}}</ref>
Thus "Drakshasava" means "extract from grapes".
