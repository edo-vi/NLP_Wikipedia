The '''''Huangdi Bashiyi Nanjing''''' ({{zh|c=黃帝八十一難經|l=The Huang Emperor's Canon of Eighty-One Difficult Issues}}), often referred to simply as the '''''Nan Jing''''', is one of the classics of [[traditional Chinese medicine]] (TCM).  

The Nan Jing was compiled in China during the first century C.E., the ''Nan Jing'' is so named because its 81 chapters seek to clarify enigmatic statements made in the [[Huangdi Neijing]] and is used extensively for study and reference in Japanese acupuncture and [[Kampo|traditional Japanese medicine]] (TJM).<ref>{{Cite web|title=Nan Jing: The Classic of Difficult Issues|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/325249215|access-date=2021-01-01|website=ResearchGate|language=en}}</ref>
