{{Vaccination}}

A '''COVID-19 vaccine card''' is a record often given to those who have received a COVID-19 vaccine showing information such as the date(s) one has received the shot(s) and the brand of vaccine one has received, sometimes including the lot number. The card also contains information identifying the recipient and the location where the shot was given. Depending on the country, it could serve as an official document [[Vaccine passports during the COVID-19 pandemic|verifying one has received vaccination]], which could be required by some institutions, such as a school or workplace, when boarding a [[cruise ship]], or when crossing an [[international border]], as proof that one has been vaccinated.

Some countries issue digital records while others issue paper records. In some [[European Union]] member states, citizens might choose to have a digital record, a piece of paper, or both.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Dada|first1=Sara|last2=Battles|first2=Heather|last3=Pilbeam|first3=Caitlin|last4=Singh|first4=Bhagteshwar|last5=Solomon|first5=Tom|last6=Gobat|first6=Nina|date=2021-09-27|title=Learning from the past & present: social science implications for COVID-19 immunity-based documentation|journal=Humanities and Social Sciences Communications|language=en|volume=8|issue=1|pages=1–9|doi=10.1057/s41599-021-00898-4|issn=2662-9992|doi-access=free}}</ref>

Digital and hard copy versions of COVID-19 vaccine cards are issued by the respective cantons upon full vaccination. The federal government provides an app and registration site, as well as QR coded documents for immunised Swiss residents. Such certification is valid for 365 days and must be provided upon entering certain premises and/or for international travel. So far, Switzerland has fully adhered to EU protocols, and digital EU vaccine certificates are approved in Switzerland, as are some of the Asian vaccines for certain travelers.<ref>[https://www.bag.admin.ch/bag/en/home/krankheiten/ausbrueche-epidemien-pandemien/aktuelle-ausbrueche-epidemien/novel-cov/covid-zertifikat/covid-zertifikat-erhalt-gueltigkeit.html Coronavirus: where and how to get a COVID certificate and how long it is valid] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230825231227/https://www.bag.admin.ch/bag/en/home/krankheiten/ausbrueche-epidemien-pandemien/aktuelle-ausbrueche-epidemien/novel-cov/covid-zertifikat/covid-zertifikat-erhalt-gueltigkeit.html |date=2023-08-25 }}.
