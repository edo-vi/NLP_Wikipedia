{{Short description|Herb that stimulates pelvic blood flow}}
'''Emmenagogues''' (also spelled '''''emmenagogs''''') are [[herb]]s which stimulate [[blood]] flow in the [[pelvic]] area and [[uterus]]; some stimulate [[menstruation]]. Women use emmenagogues to stimulate menstrual flow when menstruation is absent for reasons other than pregnancy, such as hormonal disorders or conditions like [[oligomenorrhea]] (light menses).

There are a large number of substances which can act as emmenagogues. Many, such as ''[[Mentha pulegium]]'', European pennyroyal, or [[Tansy]], may, as a tea, bring on menses, but if taken later in pregnancy, in strong or concentrated doses, such as pennyroyal or tansy oil, pose serious medical hazards including organ damage or incomplete abortions.<ref>{{cite web |title=LiverTox: Clinical and Research Information on Drug-Induced Liver Injury [Internet]. |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK548673/ |website=nih.gov |publisher=National Institute of Health |access-date=May 9, 2022 |date=March 28, 2022 |quote=Pennyroyal is an herbal extract or oil derived from leaves of the plant in the mint genus (Mentha pulegium) that was used in the past as an insect repellent and an abortifacient.
