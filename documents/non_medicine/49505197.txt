A '''truncated upland''', '''truncated highland''' or '''bevelled upland''' ({{lang-de|Rumpfgebirge}}) is the heavily [[eroded]] remains of a [[fold mountain]] range, often from an early period in [[earth history]].<ref name="GW">Murawski, H., Meyer, W.

This could result in an uplifted [[peneplain]] which is one type of truncated upland.

The [[valley]] structures of truncated uplands are often more irregular than in the younger [[fold mountains]], which is due to the considerably younger [[tectonic]] processes and stronger  [[erosion (geology)|erosion]] of the former [[mountain range]]s that were originally often up to several thousand metres high. By contrast, their [[plateaux]] are [[orographically]] similar in shape.

In western Europe many of the [[Central Upland]] ranges fall into the category of truncated uplands – for example the [[Harz]], the [[Ore Mountains]], the [[Fichtel Mountains]] and the [[Rhenish Massif]]. Other ranges also date to the time of the [[Variscan orogeny]], including those on either side of the [[Rhine]], such as the [[Black Forest]] and [[Vosges]] and, from the [[Bavarian Forest]] in northeast [[Bavaria]], through the [[Bohemian Forest]] in the [[Czech Republic]] to the [[Bohemian Massif]] in [[Austria]] and the Czech Republic, not to mention the French [[Massif Central]]. This mountain formation took place in the Middle [[Palaeozoic]], during the [[Devonian]] and [[Carboniferous]] epochs about 350 to 250 million years ago. Already by the [[Permian]] the Variscan mountains had been eroded into the so-called Permian peneplain and overlain by [[sedimentary rock|sedimentary strata]]. These remains survive as [[Variscan]] "islands" between the younger sedimentary rocks of the [[Mesozoic]]. During the course of subsequent [[earth history]], [[fault block]] tectonics followed, which characterised the present appearance of the German Central Uplands. These truncated Variscan mountains are usually strongly affected by [[magma]]tic processes.

The erosion of the mountains exposed numerous [[mineral resources]] e.g. [[silver]] and [[iron ore]] in the [[Harz]] as well as [[copper]] (the [[Rammelsberg]] is a [[type locality (geology)|type locality]] for [[SEDEX]] deposits), or [[uranium]] in the [[Ore Mountains]].

Even older are the [[Caledonian orogeny|Caledonian]] Mountains of [[Scotland]] and the rest of the [[plateaux]] and coastal mountains in [[Scandinavia]], which were formed about 500 million years ago.

In North America the almost 3,000-kilometre-long [[mountain chain]] of the [[Appalachians]] is one of the largest areas of truncated highland in the world. It extends in widths of 200 to 300 kilometre from the [[Southern United States|southern states]] of the United States to the east Canadian [[Newfoundland]], but only reaches heights of just over 2,000 metres in the south. Many [[mineral deposit]]s of coal, [[mineral oil]] and [[iron ore]], as well as fertile [[plain]]s make the range and its surrounding area into one of the richest regions of America.

The [[Urals]] between eastern Europe and [[Siberia]] have a similar importance in terms of [[mining]] and the economy; and the extent of these mountains in Russia, which are up to 1,900 metres high, is similar to that of the Appalachians.
