'''Extinct isotopes of superheavy elements''' are isotopes of [[superheavy element]]s whose [[half-lives]] were too short to have lasted through the [[formation of the Solar System]],<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal|title = Extinct <sup>244</sup>Pu in Ancient Zircons|jstor = 3839259|journal = Science|date = 2004-01-01|pages = 89–91|volume = 306|issue = 5693|first1 = Grenville|last1 = Turner|first2 = T.

== Carbonaceous chondrite fission xenon ==
Carbonaceous chondrite fission [[xenon]], often abbreviated as CCF Xe, are a collection of different [[isotopes of xenon]] that were thought to have arisen from the decay of a superheavy element within the [[island of stability]]. Early studies proposed that the half life of the theoretical progenitor of CCF Xe to be on the order of 10<sup>8</sup> years.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Implied Superheavy Element Decay Lifetime from Meteorites|journal = Nature|date = 1971-09-24|pages = 258–260|volume = 233|issue = 5317|doi = 10.1038/233258a0|language = en|first = David N.|last = Schramm|bibcode = 1971Natur.233..258S|pmid=16063318| s2cid=4171749 }}</ref> A later attempt at characterization of the progenitor in 1975 by Edward Anders, a professor of chemistry at the University of Chicago, and colleague John Larimer suggested a heat of vaporization of 54 kJ/mol and a boiling point of 2500K for the element and, based on estimated accretion temperatures, they also proposed elements 111 and 115 (today named [[roentgenium]] and [[moscovium]]) <!-- What are elements 111 and 115?

=== Allende meteorite ===

Anders went on to study samples of the [[Allende meteorite]], the largest [[carbonaceous chondrite]] ever found on Earth.

=== Evidence against carbonaceous fission xenon ===
By the 1980s, CCF Xe actually being the product of fission was doubtful, and the alternate theory that it had arisen from [[r-process|''r''-process]] (neutron capture) [[nucleosynthesis]] gained more ground.<ref name=":4">{{Cite journal|title = Alternative hypothesis for the origin of CCF xenon|journal = Nature|date = 1975-02-06|pages = 417–419|volume = 253|issue = 5491|doi = 10.1038/253417a0|language = en|first = David C.|last = Black|bibcode = 1975Natur.253..417B | s2cid=4293499 }}</ref> Researchers looked at the isotopic anomalies in neighboring elements [[samarium]], [[neodymium]], and [[barium]], and compared to the amount of xenon. Whether CCF Xe was produced by nucleosynthesis or fission, comparable amounts of barium-135 should be produced.<ref name=":0" /> When researchers compared the experimental data to predicted amounts of Barium following each model, neither model came close to predicting the anomalies correctly, leading to Lewis et al. calling the experiment an "embarrassment" for both models.{{cn|date=August 2022}} However, in the case of nucleosynthesis, it is possible that [[samarium]], [[neodymium]], and [[barium]] were separated from Xe by prior condensation in the supernova shell or plasma processes.<ref name=":0" /> Based on this data it was deemed unlikely that CCF Xe had actually arose from fission.
