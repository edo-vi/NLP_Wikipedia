'''Societal collapse''' (also known as '''civilizational collapse''' or '''systems collapse''') is the fall of a complex human [[society]] characterized by the loss of [[cultural identity]] and of [[social complexity]] as an [[Complex adaptive system|adaptive system]], the downfall of [[government]], and the rise of [[violence]].<ref name=":8" /> Possible causes of a societal collapse include natural catastrophe, war, pestilence, famine,  [[economic collapse]],  [[population decline]] or [[overshoot (population)|overshoot]], [[mass migration]], and [[sabotage]] by rival civilizations. A collapsed society may revert to a more primitive state, be absorbed into a stronger society, or completely disappear.

Virtually all civilizations have suffered such a fate, regardless of their size or complexity, but some of them later revived and transformed, such as China, India, and Egypt. However, others never recovered, such as the Western and Eastern Roman Empires, the [[Spanish conquest of the Maya|Maya civilization]], and the [[History of Easter Island#Destruction of society and population|Easter Island civilization]].<ref name=":8" /> Societal collapse is generally quick<ref name=":8" /> but rarely abrupt.<ref name=":17" />

Anthropologists, (quantitative) historians, and sociologists have proposed a variety of explanations for the collapse of civilizations involving causative factors such as environmental change, depletion of resources, unsustainable complexity, invasion, disease, decay of social cohesion, rising [[social inequality|inequality]], long-term decline of [[cognitive abilities]], loss of [[creativity]], and misfortune.<ref name=":8" /><ref name=":5" /> However, complete extinction of a culture is not inevitable, and in some cases, the new societies that arise from the ashes of the old one are evidently its offspring, despite a dramatic reduction in sophistication.<ref name=":5" /> Moreover, the influence of a collapsed society, such as the Western Roman Empire, may linger on long after its death.<ref name=":18" />

The study of societal collapse, [[collapsology]], is a topic for specialists of [[history]], [[anthropology]], [[sociology]], and [[political science]]. More recently, they are joined by experts in [[cliodynamics]] and study of [[complex system]]s.<ref>{{cite news|last=Pasha-Robinson|first=Lucy|date=7 January 2017|title='Society could end in less than a decade,' predicts academic|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/society-end-western-world-apocalypse-researcher-cliodynamics-political-turmoil-a7515156.html|access-date=21 May 2019}}</ref><ref name=":5" />

== Concept ==
[[Joseph Tainter]] frames societal collapse in  ''[[The Collapse of Complex Societies]]'' (1988), a seminal and founding work of the academic discipline on societal collapse.<ref name="NYTainter">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/04/magazine/societal-collapse.html|author=Ben Ehrenreich|date=4 November 2020|title=How Do You Know When Society Is About to Fall Apart?|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=10 February 2021}}</ref> He elaborates that 'collapse' is a "broad term," but in the sense of societal collapse, he views it as "a ''political'' process."<ref name="Tainter">{{cite book|title=The Collapse of Complex Societies|author=Joseph A. Tainter|date=1988|series=New Studies in Archaeology|publisher=Cambridge University Press}} "What is collapse? 
'Collapse' is a broad term that can cover many kinds of processes. It means different 
things to different people. Some see collapse as a thing that could happen only to societies organized at the most complex level. To them, the notion of tribal societies or village horticulturalists collapsing will seem odd. Others view collapse in terms of 
economic disintegration, of which the predicted end of industrial society is the 
ultimate expression. Still others question the very utility of the concept, pointing out that art styles and literary traditions often survive political decentralization. 
Collapse, as viewed in the present work, is a political process. It may, and often 
does, have consequences in such areas as economics, art, and literature, but it is 
fundamentally a matter of the sociopolitical sphere. A society has collapsed when it 
displays a rapid, significant loss of an established level of sociopolitical complexity. The 
term 'established level' is important. To qualify as an instance of collapse a society 
must have been at, or developing toward, a level of complexity for more than one or 
two generations. The demise of the Carolingian Empire, thus, is not a case of collapse 
- merely an unsuccessful attempt at empire building. The collapse, in turn, must be 
rapid - taking no more than a few decades - and must entail a substantial loss of 
sociopolitical structure. Losses that are less severe, or take longer to occur, are to be 
considered cases of weakness and decline. [...] The fall of the Roman Empire is, in the West, the most widely known instance of 
collapse, the one which comes most readily to popular thought." (Pages 4-5)</ref> He further narrows societal collapse as a rapid process (within "few decades") of "substantial loss of sociopolitical structure," giving the [[fall of the Western Roman Empire]] as "the most widely known instance of collapse" in the Western world.<ref name="Tainter"/>

Others, particularly in response to the popular ''[[Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed|Collapse]]'' (2005) by [[Jared Diamond]]<ref>{{cite book|title=Questioning Collapse: Human Resilience, Ecological Vulnerability, and the Aftermath of Empire|editor1=Patricia A. McAnany|editor2=Norman Yoffee|date=2009}}</ref> and more recently, have argued that societies discussed as cases of collapse are better understood through [[Resilience (organizational)|resilience]] and [[societal transformation]],<ref>{{cite book|title=Beyond Collapse: Archaeological Perspectives on Resilience, Revitalization, and Transformation in Complex Societies|editor=Ronald K. Faulseit|publisher=Southern Illinois University Press|series=Occasional Paper|number=42|date=2016}}</ref> or "reorganization", especially if collapse is understood as a "complete end" of political systems, which according to [[Shmuel Eisenstadt]] has not taken place at any point.<ref name="Eisenstadt"/> Eisenstadt also points out that a clear differentiation between total or partial decline and "possibilities of regeneration" is crucial for the preventive purpose of the study of societal collapse.<ref name="Eisenstadt">{{cite book|chapter=Beyond Collapse|date=1991|author=Shmuel Eisenstadt|editor1=Norman Yoffee|editor2=George L. Cowgill|title=The Collapse of Ancient States and Civilizations|page=242}}</ref> This frame of reference often rejects the term collapse and critiques the notion that cultures simply vanish when the political structures that organize labor for large archaeologically prominent projects do. For example, while the [[Maya civilization|Ancient Maya]] are often touted as a prime example of collapse, in reality this reorganization was simply the result of the removal of the political system of Divine Kingship largely in the eastern lowlands as many cities in the western highlands of [[Mesoamerica]] maintained this system of divine kingship into the 16th century. The Maya continue to maintain cultural and linguistic continuity into the present day.

The social scientist Luke Kemp analyzed dozens of civilizations, which he defined as "a society with agriculture, multiple cities, military dominance in its geographical region and a continuous political structure," from 3000 BC to 600 AD and calculated that the average life span of a civilization is close to 340 years.<ref name=":8" /> Of them, the most durable were the [[Kingdom of Kush|Kushite Kingdom]] in Northeast Africa (1,150 years), the [[Kingdom of Aksum|Aksumite Empire]] in East Africa (1,100 years), and the [[Vedic period|Vedic civilization]] in South Asia and the [[Olmecs]] in Mesoamerica (both 1,000 years), and the shortest-lived were the [[Nanda Empire]] in India (24) and the [[Qin dynasty]] in China (14).<ref>{{Cite web|last=Kemp|first=Luke|date=19 February 2019|title=The lifespans of ancient civilisations|url=https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20190218-the-lifespans-of-ancient-civilisations-compared|access-date=6 September 2020|website=BBC Future}}</ref>

A statistical analysis of empires by complex systems specialist Samuel Arbesman suggests that collapse is generally a random event and does not depend on age. That is analogous to what evolutionary biologists call the [[Red Queen hypothesis]], which asserts that for a species in a harsh ecology, extinction is a persistent possibility.<ref name=":8" />

Contemporary discussions about societal collapse are seeking resilience by suggesting societal transformation.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1073/pnas.1207552109|date=24 July 2012|author1=Leonie J. Pearson|author2=Craig J.

== Causes of collapse ==
Because human societies are complex systems, common factors may contribute to their decline that are economical, environmental, demographic, social and cultural, and they may [[domino effect|cascade into another]] and build up to the point that could overwhelm any mechanisms that would otherwise maintain stability. Unexpected and abrupt changes, which experts call [[Nonlinear system|nonlinearities]], are some of the warning signs.<ref name=":10" /> In some cases, a natural disaster (such as a tsunami, earthquake, [[pandemic]], massive fire or climate change) may precipitate a collapse. Other factors such as a [[Malthusian catastrophe]], [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]], or [[resource depletion]] might be contributory factors of collapse, but studies of past societies seem to suggest that those factors did not cause the collapse alone.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Joseph A. Tainter|title=Archaeology of Overshoot and Collapse|doi=10.1146/annurev.anthro.35.081705.123136|journal=Annual Review of Anthropology|pages=59–74|volume=35|year=2006}}</ref> Significant inequity and exposed corruption may combine with lack of loyalty to established political institutions and result in an oppressed lower class rising up and seizing power from a smaller wealthy elite in a [[revolution]]. The diversity of forms that societies evolve corresponds to diversity in their failures. [[Jared Diamond]] suggests that societies have also collapsed through [[deforestation]], loss of soil fertility, restrictions of trade and/or rising endemic violence.<ref>Diamond, Jared "Collapse: Why some societies succeed and others fail"</ref>

In the case of the Western Roman Empire, some argued that it did not collapse but merely [[Historiography of the fall of the Western Roman Empire#Transformation|transformed]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Mark Damen|date=28 January 2017|title=The Myth of the "Fall" of Rome|url=https://brewminate.com/the-myth-of-the-fall-of-rome/|access-date=9 February 2021}}</ref>

Archeologists identified signs of a megadrought for a millennium between 5,000 and 4,000 years ago in Africa and Asia. The drying of the Green Sahara not only turned it into a desert but also disrupted the monsoon seasons in South and Southeast Asia and caused flooding in East Asia, which prevented successful harvest and the development of complex culture. It coincided with and may have caused the decline and the fall of the [[Akkadian Empire]] in Mesopotamia and the Indus Valley Civilization.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Choi|first=Charles|date=24 August 2020|title=Ancient megadrought may explain civilization's 'missing millennia' in Southeast Asia|work=Science Magazine|url=https://www.science.org/content/article/ancient-megadrought-may-explain-civilization-s-missing-millennia-southeast-asia|access-date=31 August 2020}}</ref> The dramatic shift in climate is known as the [[4.2-kiloyear event]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Collapse of civilizations worldwide defines youngest unit of the Geologic Time Scale|url=http://www.stratigraphy.org/index.php/ics-news-and-meetings/119-collapse-of-civilizations-worldwide-defines-youngest-unit-of-the-geologic-time-scale|access-date=15 July 2018|series=News and Meetings|publisher=International Commission on Stratigraphy}}</ref>

Volcanic eruptions can abruptly influence the climate. During a large eruption, [[sulfur dioxide]] (SO<sub>2</sub>) is expelled into the [[stratosphere]], where it could stay for years and gradually get oxidized into sulfate aerosols. Being highly reflective, sulfate aerosols reduce the incident sunlight and cool the Earth's surface. By drilling into glaciers and ice sheets, scientists can access the archives of the history of atmospheric composition. A team of multidisciplinary researchers led by Joseph McConnell of the Desert Research Institute in Reno, Nevada deduced that a volcanic eruption occurred in 43 BC, a year after the [[assassination of Julius Caesar]] on the Ides of March (15 March) in 44 BC, which left a power vacuum and led to bloody civil wars. According to historical accounts, it was also a period of poor weather, crop failure, widespread famine, and disease. Analyses of tree rings and cave stalagmites from different parts of the globe provided complementary data. The Northern Hemisphere got drier, but the Southern Hemisphere became wetter. Indeed, the Greek historian [[Appian]] recorded that there was a lack of flooding in Egypt, which also faced famine and pestilence. Rome's interest in Egypt as a source of food intensified, and the aforementioned problems and civil unrest weakened Egypt's ability to resist. Egypt came under Roman rule after [[Cleopatra]] committed suicide in 30 BC. While it is difficult to say for certain whether Egypt would have become a Roman province if [[Mount Okmok|Okmok volcano]] (in modern-day Alaska) had not erupted, the eruption likely hastened the process.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wilson|first=R.

More generally, recent research pointed to climate change as a key player in the decline and fall of historical societies in China, the Middle East, Europe, and the Americas. In fact, [[paleoclimatology|paleoclimatogical]] temperature reconstruction suggests that historical periods of social unrest, societal collapse, and population crash and significant climate change often occurred simultaneously. A team of researchers from Mainland China and Hong Kong were able to establish a causal connection between climate change and large-scale human crises in pre-industrial times. Short-term crises may be caused by social problems, but climate change was the ultimate cause of major crises, starting with economic depressions.<ref name=":13">{{Cite journal|last1=Zhang|first1=David D.|last2=Lee|first2=Harry F.|last3=Wang|first3=Cong|last4=Li|first4=Baosheng|last5=Pei|first5=Qing|last6=Zhang|first6=Jane|last7=An|first7=Yulun|date=18 October 2011|title=The causality analysis of climate change and large-scale human crisis|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=108|issue=42|pages=17296–17301|doi=10.1073/pnas.1104268108|pmid=21969578|pmc=3198350|s2cid=33451915|doi-access=free}}</ref> Moreover, since agriculture is highly dependent on climate, any changes to the regional climate from the optimum can induce crop failures.<ref name=":27">{{Cite journal|last1=Zhang|first1=David D.|last2=Brecke|first2=Peter|last3=Lee|first3=Harry F.|last4=He|first4=Yuan-Qing|last5=Zhang|first5=Jane|date=4 December 2007|editor-last=Ehrlich|editor-first=Paul R.|title=Global climate change, war, and population decline in recent human history|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=104|issue=49|pages=19214–19219|doi=10.1073/pnas.0703073104|pmid=18048343|pmc=2148270|bibcode=2007PNAS..10419214Z|doi-access=free}}</ref>

The Mongol conquests corresponded to a period of cooling in the Northern Hemisphere between the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, when the [[Medieval Warm Period]] was giving way to the Little Ice Age, which caused ecological stress. In Europe, the cooling climate did not directly facilitate the [[Black Death]], but it caused wars, mass migration, and famine, which helped diseases spread.<ref name=":27" />

A more recent example is the [[The General Crisis|General Crisis of the Seventeenth Century]] in Europe, which was a period of inclement weather, crop failure, economic hardship, extreme intergroup violence, and high mortality because of the [[Little Ice Age]]. The [[Maunder Minimum]] involved [[sunspots]] being exceedingly rare. Episodes of social instability track the cooling with a time lap of up to 15 years, and many developed into armed conflicts, such as the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618–1648),<ref name=":13" /> which started as a war of succession to the Bohemian throne. Animosity between Protestants and Catholics in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] (in modern-day Germany) added fuel to the fire. Soon, it escalated to a huge conflict that involved all major European powers and devastated much of Germany. When the war had ended, some regions of the empire had seen their populations drop by as much as 70%.{{sfn|National Geographic|2007|pp=190-191}}<ref group="note">See the end of the section '[[#Demographic dynamics|Demographic dynamics]]' for a chart of the death rate (per 100,000) of the Thirty Years' War compared to other armed conflicts between 1400 and 2000.</ref> However, not all societies faced crises during this period.

A mysterious loose confederation of fierce maritime marauders, known as the [[Sea Peoples]], was identified as one of the main causes of the [[Late Bronze Age collapse]] in the Eastern Mediterranean.<ref name=":22">{{Cite web|last=Mark|first=Joshua J.|date=2 September 2009|title=Sea Peoples|url=https://www.worldhistory.org/Sea_Peoples/|access-date=1 October 2020|website=[[World History Encyclopedia]]}}</ref> The Sea Peoples might have themselves been victims of the environmental changes that led to widespread famine and precipitated the Collapse.<ref name=":17" /> After the [[Battle of Kadesh]] against the Egyptians in 1285 BC, the [[Hittite Empire]] began to show signs of decline. Attacks by the Sea Peoples accelerated the process, and internal power struggles, crop failures, and famine were contributory factors. The Egyptians, with whom the Hittites signed a peace treaty, supplied them with food in times of famine, but it was not enough. Around 1200 BC, the Sea Peoples seized a port on the west coast of Asia Minor, cutting off the Hittites from their trade routes from which their supply of grain came. [[Hattusa]], the Hittite capital, was destroyed. Some Hittite territories survived but would eventually be occupied by the Assyrians in the seventh century BC.{{sfn|National Geographic|2007|pp=36-37}}

The [[Minoan civilization]], based on [[Crete]], centered on religious rituals and seaborne trade. In around 1450 BC, it was absorbed into [[Mycenaean Greece]], which itself went into serious decline around 1200 BC because of various military conflicts, including the [[Dorian invasion]] from the north and attacks from the Sea Peoples.{{sfn|National Geographic|2007|pp=56-57}}[[File:Invasions of the Roman Empire 1.png|thumb|upright=1.4|[[Migration Period|Barbarian invasions]] played an important role in the fall of the Western Roman Empire.]]In the third century BC, a Eurasian nomadic people, the [[Xiongnu]], began threatening China's frontiers, but by the first century BC, they had been completely expelled. They then turned their attention westward and displaced various other tribes in Eastern and Central Europe, which led to a cascade of events. [[Attila]] rose to power as leader of the [[Huns]] and initiated a campaign of invasions and looting and went as far as [[Gaul]] (modern-day France). Attila's Huns were clashing with the Roman Empire, which had already been divided into two-halves for ease of administration: the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] and the [[Western Roman Empire]]. Despite managing to stop Attila at the [[Battle of the Catalaunian Plains|Battle of Chalons]] in 451 AD, the Romans were unable to prevent Attila from attacking [[Roman Italy]] the next year.

=== Famine, economic depression, and internal strife ===
{{See also|List of famines|List of revolutions and rebellions}}
Around 1210 BC, the [[New Kingdom of Egypt]] shipped large amounts of grains to the disintegrating Hittite Empire. Thus, there had been a food shortage in Anatolia but not the Nile Valley.<ref name=":17" /> However, that soon changed. Although Egypt managed to deliver a decisive and final defeat to the Sea Peoples at the [[Battle of the Delta|Battle of Xois]], Egypt itself went into steep decline. The collapse of all other societies in the Eastern Mediterranean disrupted established trade routes and caused widespread economic depression. Government workers became underpaid, which resulted in the first labor strike in recorded history and undermined royal authority.<ref name=":22" /> There was also political infighting between different factions of government. Bad harvest from the reduced flooding at the Nile led to a major famine. Food prices rose to eight times their normal values and occasionally even reached twenty-four times. Runaway [[inflation]] followed. Attacks by the Libyans and Nubians made things even worse. Throughout the [[Twentieth Dynasty of Egypt|Twentieth Dynasty]] (~1187–1064 BC), Egypt devolved from a major power in the Mediterranean to a deeply divided and weakened state, which later came to be ruled by the Libyans and the Nubians.<ref name=":17" />

Between 481 BC and 221 BC, the [[Warring States period|Period of the Warring States]] in China ended by King Zheng of the Qin dynasty succeeding in [[Qin's wars of unification|defeating six competing factions]] and thus becoming the first Chinese emperor, titled [[Qin Shi Huang]]. A ruthless but efficient ruler, he raised a disciplined and professional army and introduced a significant number of reforms, such as unifying the language and creating a single currency and system of measurement. In addition, he funded dam constructions and began building the first segment of what was to become the [[Great Wall of China]] to defend his realm against northern nomads. Nevertheless, internal feuds and rebellions made his empire fall apart after his death in 210 B.C.{{sfn|National Geographic|2007|pp=100-103}}

In the early fourteenth century AD, Britain suffered repeated rounds of crop failures from unusually heavy rainfall and flooding. Much livestock either starved or drowned. Food prices skyrocketed, and King Edward II attempted to rectify the situation by imposing price controls, but vendors simply refused to sell at such low prices. In any case, the act was abolished by the Lincoln Parliament in 1316. Soon, people from commoners to nobles were finding themselves short of food. Many resorted to begging, crime, and eating animals they otherwise would not eat. People in northern England had to deal with raids from Scotland. There were even reports of [[cannibalism]].

In Continental Europe, things were at least just as bad. The [[Great Famine of 1315–1317]] coincided with the end of the [[Medieval Warm Period]] and the start of the Little Ice Age. Some historians suspect that the change in climate was due to [[Mount Tarawera]] in New Zealand erupting in 1314.<ref name=":20">{{Cite web|last=Johnson|first=Ben|title=The Great Flood and Great Famine of 1314|url=https://www.historic-uk.com/HistoryUK/HistoryofEngland/The-Great-Flood-Great-Famine-of-1314/|access-date=1 October 2020|website=Historic UK}}</ref> The Great Famine was, however, only one of the calamities striking Europe that century, as the Hundred Years' War and Black Death would soon follow.<ref name=":20" /><ref name=":21">{{Cite news|last=Fritts|first=Rachel|date=13 December 2019|title=One of Europe's worst famines likely caused by devastating floods|work=Phys.org|department=Earth Sciences|url=https://phys.org/news/2019-12-europe-worst-famines-devastating.html|access-date=1 October 2020}}</ref> (Also see the [[Crisis of the Late Middle Ages]].)

From the description of symptoms by the Greek physician [[Galen]], which included coughing, fever, (blackish) diarrhea, swollen throat, and thirst, modern experts identified the probable culprits of the [[Antonine Plague]] (165–180 AD) to have been [[smallpox]] or [[measles]].<ref name=":25" /><ref name=":26" /> The disease likely started in China and spread to the West via the [[Silk Road]]. Roman troops first contracted the disease in the East before they returned home. Striking a virgin population, the Antonine Plague had dreadful mortality rates; between one third to half of the population, 60 to 70 million people, perished. Roman cities suffered from a combination of overcrowding, poor hygiene, and unhealthy diets. They quickly became epicenters. Soon, the disease reached as far as Gaul and mauled Roman defenses along the Rhine. The ranks of the previously formidable Roman army had to be filled with freed slaves, German mercenaries, criminals, and gladiators. That ultimately failed to prevent the Germanic tribes from crossing the Rhine. On the civilian side, the Antonine Plague created drastic shortages of businessmen, which disrupted trade, and farmers, which led to a food crisis. An economic depression followed and government revenue fell. Some accused Emperor [[Marcus Aurelius]] and Co-Emperor [[Lucius Verus]], both of whom victims of the disease, of affronting the [[List of Roman deities|gods]], but others blamed Christians. However, the Antonine Plague strengthened the position of the monotheistic religion of [[Christianity]] in the formerly-polytheistic society, as Christians won public admiration for their good works. Ultimately the Roman army, the Roman cities, the size of the empire and its trade routes, which were required for Roman power and influence to exist, facilitated the spread of the disease. The Antonine Plague is considered by some historians as a useful starting point for understanding the decline and fall of the Western Roman Empire. It was followed by the [[Plague of Cyprian]] (249–262 AD) and the Plague of Justinian (541-542). Together, they cracked the foundations of the Roman Empire.<ref name=":26">{{Cite web|last=Horgan|first=John|date=2 May 2019|title=Antonine Plague|url=https://www.worldhistory.org/Antonine_Plague/|access-date=1 October 2020|website=[[World History Encyclopedia]]}}</ref>

In the sixth century AD, while the Western Roman Empire had already succumbed to attacks by the Germanic tribes, the Eastern Roman Empire stood its ground. In fact, a peace treaty with the Persians allowed Emperor [[Justinian I|Justinian the Great]] to concentrate on recapturing territories belonging to the Western Empire. His generals, [[Belisarius]] and [[Narses]], achieved a number of important victories against the Ostrogoths and the Vandals.{{sfn|National Geographic|2007|pp=84-85}} However, their hope of keeping the Western Empire was dashed by the arrival of what became known as the [[Plague of Justinian]] (541-542). According to the Byzantine historian [[Procopius|Procopius of Caesarea]], the epidemic originated in China and Northeastern India and reached the Eastern Roman Empire via trade routes terminating in the Mediterranean. Modern scholarship has deduced that the epidemic was caused by the bacterium ''[[Yersinia pestis]]'', the same one that would later bring the Black Death, the single deadliest pandemic in human history, but how many actually died from it remains uncertain. Current estimates put the figure between thirty and fifty million people,<ref name=":15" /> a significant portion of the human population at that time.<ref name=":19">{{Cite web|last=Walsh|first=Bryan|date=25 March 2020|title=Covid-19: The history of pandemics|url=https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200325-covid-19-the-history-of-pandemics|access-date=19 September 2020|website=BBC Future}}</ref> The Plague arguably cemented the fate of Rome.<ref name=":15">{{Cite web|last=LePan|first=Nicholas|date=14 March 2020|title=Visualizing the History of Pandemics|url=https://www.visualcapitalist.com/history-of-pandemics-deadliest/|access-date=11 September 2020|website=The Visual Capitalist}}</ref>

The epidemic also devastated the [[Sasanian Empire]] in Persia. Caliph [[Abu Bakr]] seized the opportunity to launch military campaigns that [[Muslim conquest of Persia|overran the Sassanians]] and captured Roman-held territories in the Caucasus, the Levant, Egypt, and elsewhere in North Africa. Before the Justinian Plague, the Mediterranean world had been commercially and culturally stable. After the Plague, it fractured into a trio of civilizations battling for power: the Islamic Civilization, the Byzantine Empire, and what later became known as Medieval Europe. With so many people dead, the supply of workers, many of whom were slaves, was critically short. Landowners had no choice but to lend pieces of land to serfs to work the land in exchange for military protection and other privileges. That sowed the seeds of [[feudalism]].<ref name=":24">{{Cite web|last=Latham|first=Andrew|date=1 October 2020|title=How three prior pandemics triggered massive societal shifts|url=https://theconversation.com/how-three-prior-pandemics-triggered-massive-societal-shifts-146467|access-date=1 October 2020|website=The Conversation}}</ref>

However, that account of the origin of the Black Death in Europe remains controversial, though plausible, because of the complex epidemiology of the plague. Modern epidemiologists do not believe that the Black Death had a single source of spreading into Europe. Research into the past on this topic is further complicated by politics and the passage of time. It is difficult to distinguish between natural epidemics and biological warfare, both of which are common throughout human history.<ref name=":4" /> Biological weapons are economical because they turn an enemy casualty into a delivery system and so were favored in armed conflicts of the past.

With labor in short supply, workers' bargaining power increased dramatically. Various inventions that reduced the cost of labor, saved time, and raised productivity, such as the three-field crop rotation system, the iron plow, the use of manure to fertilize the soil, and the water pumps, were widely adopted. Many former serfs, now free from feudal obligations, relocated to the cities and changed profession to crafts and trades. The more successful ones became the new middle class. Trade flourished as demands for a myriad of consumer goods rose. Society became wealthier and could afford to fund the arts and the sciences.<ref name=":24" />

Encounters between European explorers and Native Americans exposed the latter to a variety of diseases of extraordinary virulence. Having migrated from Northeastern Asia 15,000 years ago, Native Americans had not been introduced to the plethora of contagious diseases that emerged after the rise of agriculture in the Old World. As such, they had immune systems that were ill-equipped to handle the diseases to which their counterparts in Eurasia had become resistant. When the Europeans arrived in the Americas, in short order, the indigenous populations of the Americas found themselves facing smallpox, [[measles]], [[whooping cough]], and the bubonic plague, among others. In tropical areas, malaria, [[yellow fever]], [[dengue fever]], [[Onchocerciasis|river blindness]], and others appeared. Most of these tropical diseases were traced to Africa.<ref name=":3" /> Smallpox ravaged Mexico in the 1520s and killed 150,000 in [[Tenochtitlán]] alone, including the emperor, and Peru in the 1530s, which aided the European conquerors.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/empire_seapower/smallpox_01.shtml|title=BBC - History - British History in depth: Smallpox: Eradicating the Scourge|publisher=BBC}}</ref> A combination of Spanish military attacks and evolutionarily novel diseases finished off the Aztec Empire in the sixteenth century.<ref name=":8" /><ref name=":3" /> It is commonly believed that the death of as much as 90% or 95% of the [[Population history of indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American population]] of the [[New World]] was caused by [[Old World]] diseases,<ref name=":3" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/gunsgermssteel/variables/smallpox.html|title=Guns Germs & Steel: Variables.

Similar events took place in Oceania and Madagascar.<ref name=":3" /> Smallpox was externally brought to Australia.

As humans spread around the globe, human societies flourish and become more dependent on trade, and because urbanization means that people leave sparsely-populated rural areas for densely-populated neighborhoods, infectious diseases spread much more easily. Outbreaks are frequent, even in the modern era, but medical advances have been able to alleviate their impacts.<ref name=":15" /> In fact, the human population grew tremendously in the twentieth century, as did the population of farm animals, from which diseases could [[Zoonosis|jump to humans]], but in the developed world and increasingly also in the developing world, people are less likely to fall victim to infectious diseases than ever before. For instance, the advent of antibiotics, starting with [[penicillin]] in 1928, has resulted in the saving of the lives of hundreds of millions of people suffering from bacterial infections. However, there is no guarantee that would continue because bacteria are becoming increasingly [[Antimicrobial resistance|resistant to antibiotics]], and doctors and public health experts such as former Chief Medical Officer for England [[Sally Davies (doctor)|Sally Davies]] have even warned of an incoming "antibiotic apocalypse." The World Health Organization warned in 2019 that the spread of vaccine scepticism has been accompanied by the resurrection of long-conquered diseases like measles. This lead the WHO to name the antivaccination movement one of the world's top 10 public-health threats.<ref name=":19" />

Quantitatively, periods of unrest included many times more events of instability per decade and occurred when the population was declining, rather than increasing. Pre-industrial agrarian societies typically faced instability after one or two centuries of stability. However, a population approaching its carrying capacity alone is not enough to trigger general decline if the people remained united and the ruling class strong. Other factors had to be involved, such as having more aspirants for positions of the elite than the society could realistically support ([[elite overproduction]]), which led to social strife, and chronic inflation, which caused incomes to fall and threatened the fiscal health of the state.<ref name=":6" /> In particular, an excess in especially young adult male population predictably led to social unrest and violence, as the third and higher-order parity sons had trouble realizing their economic desires and became more open to extreme ideas and actions.<ref name=":7" /> Adults in their 20s are especially prone to radicalization.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Turchin|first=Peter|year=2013|title=Modeling Social Pressures Toward Political Instability|url=https://escholarship.org/uc/item/6qp8x28p|journal=Cliodynamics|language=en|volume=4|issue=2|doi=10.21237/C7clio4221333|doi-access=free}}</ref> Most historical periods of social unrest lacking in external triggers, such as natural calamities, and most genocides can be readily explained as a result of a built-up youth bulge.<ref name=":7" /> As those trends intensified, they jeopardized the social fabric, which facilitated the decline.<ref name=":6" />

In cases of collapse, civilizations tend to revert to less complex, less centralized socio-political forms using simpler technology. These are characteristics of a [[Dark Ages in history|Dark Age]]. Examples of such societal collapse are: the [[Hittite Empire]], the [[Mycenaean civilization]], the [[Western Roman Empire]], the [[Mauryan]] and [[Gupta Empire|Gupta]] Empires in India, the [[Mayas]], the [[Angkor]] in Cambodia, the [[Han dynasty|Han]] and [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] dynasties in China and the [[Mali Empire]].

'''Incorporation/Absorption''': Alternately, a society may be gradually incorporated into a more dynamic, more complex inter-regional social structure. This happened in [[Ancient Egypt]] and [[Mesopotamia]], the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] and [[Levant|Levantine cultures]], the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] and [[Delhi Sultanate]]s in India, [[Song dynasty|Song China]], the [[Aztec]] culture in Mesoamerica, the [[Inca]] culture in South America, and the modern civilizations of China, Japan, and India, as well as many modern states in the Middle East and Africa.

'''Obliteration''': Vast numbers of people in the society die, or the birth rate plunges to a level that causes a dramatic depopulation.

Other changes that may accompany a collapse:

*'''Destratification''': Complex societies stratified on the basis of class, gender, race or some other salient factor become much more homogeneous or horizontally structured. In many cases, past social stratification slowly becomes irrelevant after collapse, and societies become more egalitarian.
*'''Despecialization''': One of the most characteristic features of complex civilizations (and, in many cases, the yardstick to measure complexity) is a high level of [[division of labor|job specialization]]. The most complex societies are characterized by artisans and tradespeople, who specialize intensely in a given task. Indeed, the rulers of many past societies were hyperspecialized priests or priestesses, who were completely supported by the work of the lower classes. During societal collapse, the social institutions supporting such specialization are removed and people tend to become more generalized in their work and daily habits.
*'''Decentralization''': As power becomes decentralized, people tend to be more self-regimented and have many more personal freedoms. In many instances of collapse, there is a slackening of social rules and etiquette. Geographically speaking, communities become more parochial or isolated. For example, after the [[Classic Maya collapse|collapse of the Maya civilization]], many Maya returned to their traditional hamlets and moved away from the large cities, which had dominated the political landscape.
*'''Destructuralization''': Institutions, processes, and artifacts are all manifest in the archaeological record in abundance in large civilizations. After collapse, the evidence of epiphenomena, institutions, and types of artifacts change dramatically since people are forced to adopt more self-sufficient lifestyles.
*'''Depopulation''': Societal collapse is almost always associated with a [[population decline]]. In extreme cases, the collapse in population is so severe that the society disappears entirely, which happened with the [[History of Greenland|Greenland Vikings]] and a number of [[Polynesia]]n islands. In less extreme cases, populations are reduced until a [[demography|demographic balance]] is re-established between human societies and the depleted [[natural environment]]. A classic example is the city of [[History of Rome|Rome]], which had a population of about 1.5&nbsp;million at the peak of the [[Roman Empire]] during the reign of [[Trajan]] in the early 2nd century AD, but during the [[Early Middle Ages]], its population declined to only around 15,000 inhabitants by the 9th century.
*'''Decadence''': Sir [[John Bagot Glubb]] (1897-1987), a British military officer and historian, in his essay ''Fate of Empires'', wrote that most empires tend to experience an age of [[decadence]] before they collapse.<ref>http://www.rexresearch.com/glubb/glubb-empire.pdf {{Bare URL PDF|date=March 2022}}</ref>

They have become much more sophisticated.<ref name=":17">{{Cite journal|last=Butzer|first=Karl W.|date=6 March 2012|title=Collapse, environment, and society|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=109|issue=10|pages=3632–3639|doi=10.1073/pnas.1114845109|pmid=22371579|pmc=3309741|doi-access=free}}</ref>

=== Cognitive decline and loss of creativity ===
The anthropologist [[Joseph Tainter]] theorized that collapsed societies essentially exhausted their own designs and were unable to adapt to natural [[diminishing returns]] for what they knew as their method of survival.<ref name=":1" /> The philosopher [[Oswald Spengler]] argued that a civilization in its "winter" would see a disinclination for abstract thinking.<ref name=":17" /> The psychologists David Rand and Jonathan Cohen theorized that people switch between two broad modes of thinking. The first is fast and automatic but rigid, and the second is slow and analytical but more flexible. Rand and Cohen believe that explains why people continue with self-destructive behaviors when logical reasoning would have alerted them of the dangers ahead. People switch from the second to the first mode of thinking after the introduction of an invention that dramatically increases the standards of living. Rand and Cohen pointed to the recent examples of the antibiotic overuse leading to resistant bacteria and failure to save for retirement. Tainter noted that according to behavioral economics, the human decision-making process tends to be more irrational than rational and that as the rate of innovation declines, as measured by the number of inventions relative to the amount of money spent on [[research and development]], it becomes progressively harder for there to be a technological solution to the problem of societal collapse.<ref name=":18">{{Cite journal|last=Spinney|first=Laura|date=17 January 2018|title=End of days: Is Western civilisation on the brink of collapse?|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg23731610-300-end-of-days-is-western-civilisation-on-the-brink-of-collapse/|journal=[[New Scientist]]}}</ref>

=== Social and environmental dynamics ===
[[File:Temple of the Great Jaguar.jpg|thumb|During the 9th century AD, the central [[Maya civilization|Maya]] region suffered major [[Classic Maya collapse|political collapse]], marked by the abandonment of cities]]
What produces modern sedentary life, unlike nomadic [[hunter-gatherer]]s, is extraordinary modern economic productivity. Tainter argues that exceptional productivity is actually more the sign of hidden weakness because of a society's dependence on it and its potential to undermine its own basis for success by not being [[self-limiting (biology)|self limiting]], as demonstrated in Western culture's ideal of perpetual growth.<ref name=":1" />

As a population grows and technology makes it easier to exploit depleting resources, the environment's diminishing returns are hidden from view. Societal [[complexity]] is then potentially threatened if it develops beyond what is actually sustainable, and a disorderly reorganization were to follow. The scissors model of [[Malthusian]] collapse, in which the population grows without limit but not resources, is the idea of great opposing environmental forces cutting into each other.

The complete breakdown of economic, cultural, and social institutions with ecological relationships is perhaps the most common feature of collapse. In his book ''[[Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed]]'', Jared Diamond proposes five interconnected causes of collapse that may reinforce each other: non-sustainable exploitation of resources, climate changes, diminishing support from friendly societies, hostile neighbors, and inappropriate attitudes for change.<ref>[[Jared Diamond]], ''[[Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed]]'', [[Penguin Books]], 2005 and 2011 ({{ISBN|978-0-241-95868-1}}).</ref><ref>[http://www.ted.com/talks/jared_diamond_on_why_societies_collapse.html Jared Diamond on why societies collapse] TED talk, Feb 2003</ref>

=== Energy return on investment ===
Energy has played a crucial role throughout human history. Energy is linked to the birth, growth, and decline of each and every society. Energy surplus is required for the division of labor and the growth of cities. Massive energy surplus is needed for widespread wealth and cultural amenities. Economic prospects fluctuate in tandem with a society's access to cheap and abundant energy.<ref name=":23">{{Cite journal|last1=Hall|first1=Charles A.S.|last2=Lambert|first2=Jessica G.|last3=Balogh|first3=Stephen B.|date=January 2014|title=EROI of Different Fuels and the Implications for Society|journal=Energy Policy|volume=64|pages=141–152|doi=10.1016/j.enpol.2013.05.049|doi-access=free}}</ref>

Political scientist [[Thomas Homer-Dixon]] and ecologist [[Charles A. S. Hall|Charles Hall]] proposed an economic model called [[energy return on investment]] (EROI), which measures the amount of surplus energy a society gets from using energy to obtain energy.<ref>Homer-Dixon, Thomas (2007), "The Upside of Down: Catastrophe, Creativity and the Renewal of Civilization" (Knopf, Canada)</ref><ref name=":0" /> Energy shortages drive up prices and as such provide an incentive to explore and extract previously uneconomical sources, which may still be plentiful, but more energy would be required, and the EROI is then not as high as initially thought.<ref name=":23" />

There would be no surplus if EROI approaches 1:1. Hall showed that the real cutoff is well above that and estimated that 3:1 to sustain the essential overhead energy costs of a modern society. The EROI of the most preferred energy source, [[petroleum]], has fallen in the past century from 100:1 to the range of 10:1 with clear evidence that the natural depletion curves all are downward decay curves. An EROI of more than ~3 then is what appears necessary to provide the energy for socially important tasks, such as maintaining government, legal and financial institutions, a transportation infrastructure, manufacturing, building construction and maintenance, and the lifestyles of all members of a given society.<ref name=":0" />

The social scientist Luke Kemp indicated that alternative sources of energy, such as solar panels, have a low EROI because they have low energy density, meaning they require a lot of land, and require substantial amounts of rare earth metals to produce.<ref name=":8" /> Hall and colleagues reached the same conclusion. There is no on-site pollution, but the EROI of renewable energy sources may be too low for them to be considered a viable alternative to fossil fuels, which continue to provide the majority of the energy used by humans.<ref name=":23" />

The mathematician Safa Motesharrei and his collaborators showed that the use of non-renewable resources such as fossil fuels allows populations to grow to one order of magnitude larger than they would using renewable resources alone and as such is able to postpone societal collapse. However, when collapse finally comes, it is much more dramatic.<ref name=":18" /><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Safa Motesharrei, Jorge Rivas, Eugenia Kalnay, Ghassem R. Asrar, Antonio J.

Homer-Dixon asserted that a declining EROI was one of the reasons that the Roman Empire declined and fell. The historian Joseph Tainter made the same claim about the Maya Empire.<ref name=":8" />

===Models of societal response===
According to [[Joseph Tainter]]<ref>Tainter, Joseph (1990), ''The Collapse of Complex Societies'' (Cambridge University Press) pp. 59-60.</ref> (1990), too many scholars offer facile explanations of societal collapse by assuming one or more of the following three models in the face of collapse:

# The '''Dinosaur''', a large-scale society in which resources are being depleted at an exponential rate, but nothing is done to rectify the problem because the ruling elite are unwilling or unable to adapt to those resources' reduced availability. In this type of society, rulers tend to oppose any solutions that diverge from their present course of action but favor intensification and commit an increasing number of resources to their present plans, projects, and social institutions.
# The '''Runaway Train''', a society whose continuing function depends on constant growth (''cf.'' [[Frederick Jackson Turner]]'s [[Frontier Thesis]]). This type of society, based almost exclusively on acquisition (such as pillaging or exploitation), cannot be sustained indefinitely. The [[ancient Assyrians|Assyrian]], [[Roman Empire|Roman]] and [[Mongol Empire|Mongol]] Empires, for example, all fractured and collapsed when no new conquests could be achieved.
# The '''House of Cards''', a society that has grown to be so large and include so many complex social institutions that it is inherently unstable and prone to collapse. This type of society has been seen with particular frequency among [[Eastern Bloc]] and other [[communist]] nations, in which all social organizations are arms of the government or ruling party, such that the government must either stifle association wholesale (encouraging dissent and [[Subversive|subversion]]) or exercise less authority than it asserts (undermining its legitimacy in the public eye).
#:

====Tainter's critique====
Tainter argues that those models, though superficially useful, cannot severally or jointly account for all instances of societal collapse. Often, they are seen as interconnected occurrences that reinforce one another.

Tainter considers that social complexity is a recent and comparatively-anomalous occurrence, requiring constant support. He asserts that collapse is best understood by grasping four axioms. In his own words (p.&nbsp;194):

# human societies are problem-solving organizations;
# sociopolitical systems require energy for their maintenance;
# increased complexity carries with it increased costs per capita; and
# investment in sociopolitical complexity as a problem-solving response reaches a point of declining marginal returns.

With those facts in mind, collapse can simply be understood as a loss of the energy needed to maintain social complexity. Collapse is thus the sudden loss of social complexity, stratification, internal and external communication and exchange, and productivity.

===Toynbee's theory of decay===
In his acclaimed 12-volume work, ''[[A Study of History]]'' (1934–1961), the British historian [[Arnold J. Toynbee]] explored the rise and fall of 28 civilizations and came to the conclusion that civilizations generally collapsed mainly by internal factors, factors of their own making, but external pressures also played a role.<ref name=":8" /> He theorized that all [[civilization]]s pass through several distinct stages: genesis, growth, time of troubles, universal state, and disintegration.<ref name=":11" />

For Toynbee, a civilization is born when a "creative minority" successfully responds to the challenges posed by its physical, social, and political environment. However, the fixation on the old methods of the "creative minority" leads it to eventually cease to be creative and degenerate into merely a "[[dominant minority]]" (that forces the majority to obey without meriting obedience), which fails to recognize new ways of thinking. He argues that creative minorities deteriorate from a worship of their "former self", by which they become prideful, and they fail in adequately addressing the next challenge that they face. Similarly, the German philosopher [[Oswald Spengler]] discussed the transition from ''Kultur'' to ''Zivilisation'' in his ''[[The Decline of the West]]'' (1918).<ref name=":11" />

Toynbee argues that the ultimate sign a civilization has broken down is when the dominant minority forms a [[A Study of History#Universal state|Universal State]], which stifles political creativity. He states:

{{blockquote|First the Dominant Minority attempts to hold by force - against all right and reason - a position of inherited privilege which it has ceased to merit; and then the [[Proletariat]] repays injustice with resentment, fear with hate, and violence with violence when it executes its acts of secession. Yet the whole movement ends in positive acts of creation - and this on the part of all the actors in the tragedy of disintegration. The Dominant Minority creates a universal state, the Internal Proletariat a universal church, and the External Proletariat a bevy of barbarian war-bands.}}

He argues that as civilizations decay, they form an "Internal Proletariat" and an "External Proletariat." The Internal proletariat is held in subjugation by the dominant minority inside the civilization, and grows bitter; the external proletariat exists outside the civilization in poverty and chaos and grows envious. He argues that as civilizations decay, there is a "schism in the body social", whereby ''abandon'' and ''self-control'' together replace [[creativity]], and ''truancy'' and ''martyrdom'' together replace [[Apprenticeship|discipleship]] by the creative minority.

He argues that in that environment, people resort to [[archaism]] (idealization of the past), [[Futures studies|futurism]] (idealization of the future), [[escapism|detachment]] (removal of oneself from the realities of a decaying world), and [[transcendence (philosophy)|transcendence]] (meeting the challenges of the decaying civilization with new insight, as a prophet). He argues that those who transcend during a period of social decay give birth to a new Church with new and stronger spiritual insights around which a subsequent civilization may begin to form after the old has died. Toynbee's use of the word 'church' refers to the collective spiritual bond of a common worship, or the same unity found in some kind of [[social order]].

The historian [[Carroll Quigley]] expanded upon that theory in ''The Evolution of Civilizations'' (1961, 1979).<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Evolution of Civilizations - An Introduction to Historical Analysis (1979)|url=https://archive.org/details/CarrollQuigley-TheEvolutionOfCivilizations-AnIntroductionTo|via=Internet Archive}}</ref> He argued that societal disintegration involves the metamorphosis of social instruments, which were set up to meet actual needs, into institutions, which serve their own interest at the expense of social needs.<ref>Harry J Hogan in the foreword (p17) and Quigley in the conclusion (p416) to {{cite book|author=Carroll Quigley|url=https://archive.org/details/evolutionofcivil0000quig|title=The evolution of civilizations: an introduction to historical analysis|publisher=Liberty Press|year=1979|isbn=0-913966-56-8|access-date=26 May 2013|url-access=registration}}</ref> However, in the 1950s, Toynbee's approach to history, his style of civilizational analysis, started to face skepticism from mainstream historians who thought it put an undue emphasis on the divine, which led to his academic reputation declining. For a time, however, Toynbee's ''Study'' remained popular outside academia. Interest revived decades later with the publication of ''[[The Clash of Civilizations]]'' (1997) by the political scientist [[Samuel P. Huntington]], who viewed human history as broadly the history of civilizations and posited that the world after the end of the Cold War will be multipolar and one of competing major civilizations, which are divided by "fault lines."<ref name=":11" />

===Systems science===
Developing an integrated theory of societal collapse that takes into account the complexity of human societies remains an open problem.<ref name=":17" /> Researchers currently have very little ability to identify internal structures of large distributed systems like human societies. Genuine structural collapse seems, in many cases, the only plausible explanation supporting the idea that such structures exist. However, until they can be concretely identified, scientific inquiry appears limited to the construction of scientific narratives,<ref>T.F. Allen, J.A. Tainter et al. 2001 Dragnet Ecology: The Privilege of Science in a Postmodern World. BioScience</ref><ref name=":17" /> using [[systems thinking]] for careful [[storytelling]] about systemic organization and change.

In the 1990s, the evolutionary anthropologist and quantitative historian [[Peter Turchin]] noticed that the equations used to model the populations of predators and preys can also be used to describe the ontogeny of human societies. He specifically examined how social factors such as [[income inequality]] were related to political instability. He found recurring cycles of unrest in historical societies such as Ancient Egypt, China, and Russia. He specifically identified two cycles, one long and one short. The long one, what he calls the "secular cycle," lasts for approximately two to three centuries. A society starts out fairly equal. Its population grows and the cost of labor drops. A wealthy upper class emerges, and life for the working class deteriorates. As inequality grows, a society becomes more unstable with the lower-class being miserable and the upper-class entangled in infighting. Exacerbating social turbulence eventually leads to collapse. The shorter cycle lasts for about 50 years and consists of two generations, one peaceful and one turbulent. Looking at US history, for example, Turchin identified times of serious sociopolitical instability in 1870, 1920, and 1970. He announced in 2010 that he had predicted that in 2020, the US would witness a period of unrest at least on the same level as 1970 because the first cycle coincides with the turbulent part of the second in around 2020. He also warned that the US was not the only Western nation under strain.<ref name=":18" />

However, Turchin's model can only paint the broader picture and cannot pinpoint how bad things can get and what precisely triggers a collapse. The mathematician Safa Motesharrei also applied predator-prey models to human society, with the upper class and the lower class being the two different types of "predators" and natural resources being the "prey." He found that either extreme inequality or resource depletion facilitates a collapse. However, a collapse is irreversible only if a society experiences both at the same time, as they "fuel each other."<ref name=":18" />
