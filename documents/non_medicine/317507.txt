A '''well-bird exam''' is a check-up for [[bird]]s which are assumed to be healthy. These examinations are frequently performed by an [[avian veterinarian]] when the bird is first acquired and annually thereafter.

==The examination==
The [[veterinarian]] will likely ask the owner about the bird's housing, diet, and activities, then examine the birds feathers, eyes, ears, and [[nares]] for signs of illness. He or she will probably acquire a [[Gram's stain]], and may also clip the bird's wings and toenails if requested. He or she will likely offer advice about caring for the pet.

==Importance==
Birds often hide their illnesses very well, and an avian veterinarian may see symptoms of illness that are not observable to the untrained eye. Periodic examination serves as a baseline for comparison for future reference. If an examined bird ever becomes sick and requires the care of a veterinarian, he or she will already have much data about the bird's weight (one of the earliest indicators of illness in birds), diet, and care.
