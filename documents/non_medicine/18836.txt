In the [[history of Europe]], the '''Middle Ages''' or '''medieval period''' (also spelled '''mediæval''' or '''mediaeval''') lasted approximately from the late 5th to the late 15th centuries,<!--Do not change the date without finding a consensus on the talk page--> aligning with{{cn|reason=Not verified in the main text.|date=August 2023}} the [[Post-classical|post-classical period]] of [[World history (field)|global history]]. It began with the [[fall of the Western Roman Empire]] in 476 AD and ended with the [[fall of Constantinople]] in 1453 AD before transitioning into the [[Renaissance]] and then the [[Age of Discovery]]. The Middle Ages is the middle period of the three traditional divisions of Western history: [[classical antiquity|antiquity]], medieval, and [[modern history|modern]]. The medieval period is itself subdivided into the [[Early Middle Ages|Early]], [[High Middle Ages|High]], and [[Late Middle Ages]]. Late medieval scholars at first called these the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]] in contrast to classical antiquity; the accuracy of the term has subsequently been challenged.

[[Population decline]], [[counterurbanisation]], the collapse of centralized authority, invasion and the mass migration of [[tribe]]s, which had begun in [[late antiquity]], continued into the Early Middle Ages. The large-scale movements of the [[Migration Period]], including of [[Germanic peoples]], led to the rise of new kingdoms in Western Europe. In the 7th century, the [[Middle East]] and [[North Africa]] came under [[caliphal rule]] with the [[Arab conquests]]. The Byzantine Empire survived in the Eastern Mediterranean and advanced secular law through the ''[[Corpus Juris Civilis|Code of Justinian]]''. In the West, most kingdoms incorporated extant Roman institutions, while the influence of Christianity expanded across Europe. The [[Carolingian dynasty]] of the [[Franks]] established the [[Carolingian Empire]] during the later 8th and early 9th centuries in Western Europe before it succumbed to internal conflict and external invasions from the [[Vikings]] from the north, [[Hungarian invasions of Europe|Magyars]] from the east, and the [[Muslims]] from the south.

During the High Middle Ages, which began after 1000, the population of Europe increased greatly as technological and [[Agriculture in the Middle Ages#Technological innovation|agricultural innovations]] allowed trade to flourish and the [[Medieval Warm Period]] climate change allowed crop yields to increase. [[Manorialism]], the organisation of [[peasant]]s into villages that owed rent and labour services to the [[Nobility|nobles]], and [[feudalism]], the political structure whereby [[knight]]s and lower-status nobles owed military service to their [[overlord]]s in return for the right to rent from lands and manors, were two of the ways society was organised in the High Middle Ages. This period also saw the formal division of the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] churches, with the [[East–West Schism|East–West Schism of 1054]]. The [[Crusades]], which began in 1095, were military attempts by Western European Christians to regain control of the [[Holy Land]] from [[Muslim]]s and also contributed to the expansion of Latin Christendom in the [[Baltic region]] and the [[Iberian Peninsula]]. Kings became the heads of centralised [[nation state]]s, reducing crime and violence but making the ideal of a unified [[Christendom]] more distant. In the West, intellectual life was marked by [[scholasticism]], a philosophy that emphasised joining faith to reason, and by the founding of [[universities]]. The theology of [[Thomas Aquinas]], the paintings of [[Giotto]], the poetry of [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]] and [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]], the travels of [[Marco Polo]], and the [[Gothic architecture]] of cathedrals such as [[Chartres Cathedral|Chartres]] mark the end of this period.

The Late Middle Ages was marked by difficulties and calamities including famine, plague, and war, which significantly diminished the population of Europe; between 1347 and 1350, the [[Black Death]] killed about a third of Europeans. Controversy, [[heresy]], and the [[Western Schism]] within the Catholic Church paralleled the interstate conflict, civil strife, and [[Popular revolts in late-medieval Europe|peasant revolts]] that occurred in the kingdoms. Cultural and technological developments transformed European society, concluding the Late Middle Ages and beginning the [[early modern period]].

''Essays in Medieval Studies'' p. 4</ref>

Medieval writers divided history into periods such as the [[Six Ages of the World|Six Ages]] or the [[Four kingdoms of Daniel|Four Empires]], and considered their time to be the last before the end of the world.<ref>Mommsen "Petrarch's Conception of the 'Dark Ages'" ''Speculum'' p. 238</ref> In their concept, their age had begun when Christ had [[Redeemer (Christianity)|brought light]] to mankind, contrasted with the spiritual darkness of previous periods. The Italian humanist and poet [[Petrarch]] (d. 1374) turned the metaphor upside down, stating that the age of darkness had begun when emperors of non-Italian origin assumed power in the Roman Empire.<ref>Mommsen "Petrarch's Conception of the 'Dark Ages'" ''Speculum'' pp. 228–238</ref>

The most commonly given starting point for the Middle Ages is around 500,<ref>"[https://www.dictionary.com/browse/middle-ages Middle Ages]" Dictionary.com</ref> with 476—the year the last Western Roman Emperor was deposed—first used by Bruni.<ref name=Hankins_xvii/> For Europe as a whole, 1500 is often considered to be the end of the Middle Ages,<ref>See the title of Epstein ''Economic History of Later Medieval Europe 1000–1500'' or the end date used in Holmes (ed.) ''Oxford History of Medieval Europe''</ref> but there is no universally agreed-upon end date. Depending on the context, events such as the [[Fall of Constantinople]] in 1453, [[Christopher Columbus]]'s first voyage to the [[Americas]] in 1492, or the [[Reformation|Protestant Reformation]] in 1517 are sometimes used.<ref name=Davies291/> English historians often use the [[Battle of Bosworth Field]] in 1485 to mark the end of the period.<ref>See the title of Saul ''Companion to Medieval England 1066–1485'' and websites at [https://www.english-heritage.org.uk/learn/story-of-england/medieval/ English Heritage] and [https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/middle_ages/overview_middleages_01.shtml BBC History]</ref>

Historians from [[Romance languages|Romance language-speaking]] countries tend to divide the Middle Ages into two parts: an earlier "High" and later "Low" period. English-speaking historians, following their German counterparts, generally subdivide the Middle Ages into three intervals: "Early", "High", and "Late".<ref name=Power304/> In the 19th century, the entire Middle Ages were often referred to as the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]], but with the adoption of these subdivisions, use of this term was restricted to the Early Middle Ages in the early 20th century.<ref name=mommsen226>Mommsen "Petrarch's Conception of the 'Dark Ages'" ''Speculum'' p. 226</ref>

The [[Roman Empire]] reached its greatest territorial extent during the 2nd century AD; the following two centuries witnessed the slow decline of Roman control over its outlying territories.<ref>Cunliffe ''Europe Between the Oceans'' pp. 391–393</ref> Runaway inflation, external pressure on the frontiers, and [[Plague of Cyprian|outbreaks of plague]] combined to create the [[Crisis of the Third Century]], with emperors coming to the throne only to be rapidly replaced by new usurpers.<ref>Collins ''Early Medieval Europe'' pp. 3–6</ref> Military expenses steadily increased, mainly in response to [[Roman–Persian Wars#Roman–Sassanid War|the war]] with the [[Sasanian Empire]].<ref name=Heather111>Heather ''Fall of the Roman Empire'' p. 111</ref> The army doubled in size, and cavalry and smaller units replaced the [[Roman legion|legion]] as the main tactical unit.<ref name=Brown24-25>Brown ''World of Late Antiquity'' pp. 24–25</ref> The need for revenue led to increased taxes and a decline in numbers of the [[curiales|curial]], or landowning, class.<ref name=Heather111/> More bureaucrats were needed in the central administration to deal with the needs of the army, which led to complaints from civilians that there were more tax-collectors in the empire than tax-payers.<ref name=Brown24-25/>

The Emperor [[Diocletian]] (r. 284–305) split the empire into separately administered [[Byzantine Empire|eastern]] and [[Western Roman Empire|western halves]] in 286. This system, which eventually encompassed two [[Augustus (title)|senior]] and two [[Caesar (title)|junior co-emperors]] (hence known as the [[Tetrarchy]]) stabilised the imperial government for about two decades. Diocletian's further governmental, fiscal and military reforms bought the empire time but did not resolve the problems it was facing.<ref>Collins ''Early Medieval Europe'' pp. 8–9</ref><ref>Cunliffe ''Europe Between the Oceans'' pp. 403–406</ref> In 330, after a [[Civil wars of the Tetrarchy|period of civil war]], [[Constantine the Great]] (r. 306–337) refounded the city of [[Byzantium]] as the newly renamed eastern capital, [[Constantinople]].<ref>Collins ''Early Medieval Europe'' p. 24</ref>

For much of the 4th century, Roman society stabilised in a new form that differed from the earlier [[Culture of ancient Rome|classical period]], with a widening gulf between the rich and poor, and a decline in the vitality of the smaller towns.<ref>Brown ''World of Late Antiquity'' p. 34</ref> Another change was the [[Christianization of the Roman Empire|Christianisation]], or conversion of the empire to [[Christianity]]. The process was accelerated by the conversion of Constantine the Great, and Christianity emerged as the empire's dominant religion by the end of the century.<ref>Brown ''World of Late Antiquity'' pp. 65–68, 82–94</ref> Debates about [[Christian theology]] intensified, and those who persisted with theological views condemned at the [[ecumenical councils]] faced persecution. Such [[Heresy in Christianity|heretic views]] survived through intensive proselytizing campaigns outside the empire, or due to local ethnic groups' support in the eastern [[Roman province|provinces]], like [[Arianism]] among the Germanic peoples, or [[Monophysitism]] in Egypt and Syria.<ref>Backman, ''Worlds of Medieval Europe'' pp. 43–45</ref><ref>Collins ''Early Medieval Europe'' pp. 60–75</ref> [[Judaism]] remained a tolerated religion, although legislation limited [[History of the Jews in the Roman Empire|Jews]]' rights.<ref>Chazan, ''The Jews of Medieval Western Christendom'' p. 34</ref>

Civil war between rival emperors became common in the middle of the 4th century, diverting soldiers from the empire's frontier forces and allowing [[Barbarian#Modern academia|invaders]] to encroach.<ref>Collins ''Early Medieval Europe'' pp. 31–33</ref> Although the movements of peoples during this period are usually described as "invasions", they were not just military expeditions but [[Migration Period|migrations]] into the empire.<ref name=Brown122>Brown, ''World of Late Antiquity'', pp. 122–124</ref> In 376, hundreds of thousands of [[Goths]], fleeing from the [[Huns]], received permission from Emperor [[Valens]] (r. 364–378) to settle in Roman territory in the [[Balkans]].

The Hunnic threat remained until Attila's death in 453, when the [[Huns#Under Attila|Hunnic confederation]] he led fell apart.<ref>James ''Europe's Barbarians'' pp. 67–69</ref>

When dealing with the migrations, the Eastern Roman elites combined the deployment of armed forces with gifts and grants of offices to the tribal leaders, whereas the Western aristocrats failed to support the army but also refused to pay tribute to prevent invasions by the tribes.<ref name=Brown122/> These invasions led to the division of the western section of the empire into smaller political units, ruled by the tribes that had invaded.<ref>Wickham ''Inheritance of Rome'' p. 79</ref> The emperors of the 5th century were often controlled by military strongmen such as [[Stilicho]] (d. 408), [[Flavius Aetius|Aetius]] (d. 454), [[Aspar]] (d. 471), [[Ricimer]] (d. 472), or [[Gundobad]] (d. 516), who were partly or fully of non-Roman ancestry.<ref>Wickham, ''Inheritance of Rome'', pp. 96–97</ref> The deposition of the last emperor of the west, [[Romulus Augustulus]], in 476 has traditionally marked the end of the Western Roman Empire.<ref name=Wickham86>Wickham ''Inheritance of Rome'' p. 86</ref>{{efn-ua|An alternative date of 480 is sometimes given, as that was the year Romulus Augustulus' predecessor [[Julius Nepos]] died; Nepos had continued to assert that he was the Western emperor while holding onto [[Dalmatia]].<ref name=Wickham86/>}} The Eastern Roman Empire, often referred to as the Byzantine Empire after the fall of its western counterpart, had little ability to assert control over the lost western territories although the [[List of Byzantine emperors|Byzantine emperors]] maintained a claim over the territory.<ref>Collins ''Early Medieval Europe'' pp. 116–134</ref>

{{main|Barbarian kingdoms|Migration Period|Fall of the Western Roman Empire}}

[[File:Europe and the Near East at 476 AD.png|thumb|upright=1.1|[[Barbarian kingdoms]] and tribes after the end of the Western Roman Empire]]

In the post-Roman world, the fusion of Roman culture with the customs of the invading tribes is well documented. Popular assemblies that allowed free male tribal members more say in political matters than had been common in the Roman state developed into legislative and judicial bodies.<ref name=Wickham98>Wickham, ''Inheritance of Rome'', pp. 98–101</ref> Material artefacts left by the Romans and the invaders are often similar, and tribal items were often modelled on Roman objects.<ref name=Collins100>Collins, ''Early Medieval Europe'', p. 100</ref> Much of the scholarly and written culture of the new kingdoms was also based on Roman intellectual traditions.<ref name=Collins96>Collins, ''Early Medieval Europe'', pp. 96–97</ref> Many of the new political entities no longer supported their armies through taxes, instead relying on granting them land or rents. This meant there was less need for large tax revenues and so the [[Roman Empire#Taxation|taxation systems]] decayed.<ref name=Wickham102>Wickham, ''Inheritance of Rome'', pp. 102–103</ref>

The Germanic groups now collectively known as [[Anglo-Saxons]] settled in Britain before the middle of the 5th century. The local culture had little impact on their way of life, but the linguistic assimilation of masses of the local [[Celtic Britons]] to the newcomers is evident. By around 600, new political centres emerged, some local leaders accumulated considerable wealth, and [[Heptarchy|a number of small kingdoms]] such as [[Wessex]] and [[Mercia]] were formed. Smaller kingdoms in present-day Wales and Scotland were still under the control of the native Britons and [[Picts]].<ref name=Wickham156>Wickham ''Inheritance of Rome'' pp. 156–159</ref> Ireland was divided into even smaller political units, perhaps as many as [[List of Irish kingdoms|150 tribal kingdoms]].<ref name=Wickham164>Wickham ''Inheritance of Rome'' pp. 164–165</ref>

The [[Ostrogoths]] moved to Italy from the Balkans in the late 5th century under [[Theoderic the Great]] (r. 493–526). He set up [[Ostrogothic Kingdom|a kingdom]] marked by its co-operation between the Italians and the Ostrogoths until the last years of his reign. Power struggles between Romanized and traditionalist Ostrogothic groups followed his death, providing the opportunity for the Byzantines to [[Gothic War (535–554)|reconquer Italy]] in the middle of the 6th century.<ref name=James82>James ''Europe's Barbarians'' pp. 82–94</ref> The Burgundians settled in Gaul, and after an earlier realm was destroyed by the Huns in 436, formed [[Kingdom of the Burgundians|a new kingdom]] in the 440s.<ref name=James77>James ''Europe's Barbarians'' pp. 77–78</ref> Elsewhere in Gaul, the Franks and [[Celtic Britons]] set up stable polities. [[Francia]] was centred in northern Gaul, and the first king of whom much is known is [[Childeric I]] (d. 481).{{efn-ua|Childeric's grave was discovered at [[Tournai]] in 1653 and is remarkable for its [[grave goods]], which included weapons and a large quantity of gold.<ref>James ''Europe's Barbarians'' p. 79</ref>}} Under Childeric's son [[Clovis I]] (r. 509–511), the founder of the [[Merovingian dynasty]], the Frankish kingdom expanded and converted to Christianity.<ref name=James79>James ''Europe's Barbarians'' pp. 79–81</ref> Unlike other Germanic peoples, the Franks accepted Catholicism which facilitated their cooperation with the native [[Gallo-Roman culture|Gallo-Roman]] aristocracy.<ref>Brown ''World of Late Antiquity'' p. 124</ref> Britons fleeing from {{lang|la|Britannia}}&nbsp;– modern-day Great Britain&nbsp;– settled in what is now [[Brittany]].{{efn-ua|Brittany takes its name from this settlement by Britons.<ref name=James78>James ''Europe's Barbarians'' p. 78</ref>}}<ref name=James78/>

Other monarchies were established by the Visigoths in the [[Iberian Peninsula]], the [[Suebi]] in northwestern Iberia, and the Vandals in [[North Africa]].<ref name=James77/> The [[Lombards]] settled in [[Northern Italy]] in 568 and established a [[Kingdom of the Lombards|new kingdom]] composed of [[Duke (Lombard)|town-based duchies]].<ref name=Collins196>Collins ''Early Medieval Europe'' pp. 196–208</ref> Coming from the Asian steppes, the nomadic [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]] conquered most [[Early Slavs|Slavic]], [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] and Germanic tribes in the lowlands along the Lower and Middle Danube by the end of the 6th century, and they were routinely able to force the Eastern emperors to pay tribute.<ref name=Curta51>Curta ''Eastern Europe in the Middle Ages'' pp.&nbsp;51–59</ref> Around 670, another steppe people, the [[Bulgars]] settled at the [[Danube Delta]]. In 681, they [[Battle of Ongal|defeated]] a Byzantine imperial army, and established the [[First Bulgarian Empire]] on the Lower Danube, subjugating the local Slavic tribes.<ref name=Curta71>Curta ''Eastern Europe in the Middle Ages'' pp.&nbsp;71–77</ref>

The settlement of peoples was accompanied by changes in languages. [[Latin]], the literary language of the Western Roman Empire, was gradually replaced by [[vernacular languages]] which evolved from Latin, but were distinct from it, collectively known as [[Romance languages]]. Greek remained the language of the Byzantine Empire, but the migrations of the Slavs expanded the area of [[Slavic languages]] in [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Eastern Europe]].<ref name=Davies235>Davies ''Europe'' pp. 235–238</ref>

===Byzantine survival===

During this period the Eastern Roman Empire remained intact and experienced an economic revival that lasted into the early 7th century. Here political life was marked by closer relations between the political state and Christian Church, with doctrinal matters assuming an importance in Eastern politics that they did not have in Western Europe. Legal developments included the codification of [[Roman law]]; the first effort – the ''[[Codex Theodosianus]]'' – was completed in 438.<ref name=Wickham81>Wickham ''Inheritance of Rome'' pp. 81–83</ref> Under Emperor [[Justinian I|Justinian]] (r. 527–565), a more comprehensive compilation took place, the {{Lang|la|[[Corpus Juris Civilis]]}}.<ref name=Backman130>Backman, ''Worlds of Medieval Europe'', pp. 130–131</ref>

Justinian almost lost his throne during the [[Nika riots]], a popular revolt of elementary force that destroyed half of Constantinople in 532. After crushing the revolt, he reinforced the autocratic elements of the imperial government and mobilized his troops against the Arian western kingdoms. The general [[Belisarius]] (d. 565) conquered [[Vandalic War|North Africa from the Vandals]], and attacked the Ostrogoths, but the Italian campaign was interrupted due to an unexpected Sasanian invasion from the east. Between 541 and 543, a deadly [[Plague of Justinian|outbreak of plague]] decimated the empire's population. Justinian ceased to finance the maintenance of [[Roman roads|public roads]], and covered the lack of military personnel by developing and extensive system of border forts. In a decade, he resumed expansionism, completing the conquest of the Ostrogothic kingdom, and seizing much of southern Spain from the Visigoths.<ref name=Brown150_156>Brown ''World of Late Antiquity'' pp. 150–156</ref>

Justinian's reconquests and excessive building program have been criticised by historians for bringing his realm to the brink of bankruptcy, but many of the difficulties faced by Justinian's successors were due to other factors, including the epidemic and the massive expansion of the Avars and their Slav allies.<ref name=Brown8_10>Brown "Transformation of the Roman Mediterranean" ''Oxford Illustrated History of Medieval Europe'' pp. 8–10</ref> In the east, border defences collapsed during a [[Byzantine–Sasanian War of 602–628|new war with the Sasanian Empire]], and the Persians seized large chunks of the empire, including Egypt, Syria, and much of [[Anatolia]]. In 626, the Avars and Slavs [[Siege of Constantinople (626)|attacked Constantinople]]. Two years later, Emperor [[Heraclius]] (r. 610–641) launched an unexpected counterattack against the heart of the Sassanian Empire bypassing the Persian army in the mountains of Anatolia; the empire recovered all of its lost territories in the east.<ref name=Collins140>Collins ''Early Medieval Europe'' pp. 140–143</ref>

===Western society===
{{see also|Early medieval European dress|medieval cuisine}}

In Western Europe, some of the older Roman elite families died out while others became more involved with ecclesiastical than secular affairs. Values attached to [[Latin literature|Latin scholarship]] and [[Education in Ancient Rome|education]] mostly disappeared. While literacy remained important, it became a practical skill rather than a sign of elite status. By the late 6th century, the principal means of religious instruction in the Church had become music and art rather than the book.<ref name=Brown181>Brown ''World of Late Antiquity'' p. 181</ref> Most intellectual efforts went towards imitating classical scholarship, but some [[Early medieval literature|original works]] were created, along with now-lost oral compositions. The writings of [[Sidonius Apollinaris]] (d. 489), [[Cassiodorus]] (d. {{circa|585}}), and [[Boethius]] (d. {{circa|525}}) were typical of the age.<ref name=Brown45>Brown "Transformation of the Roman Mediterranean" ''Oxford Illustrated History of Medieval Europe'' pp. 45–49</ref> Aristocratic culture focused on great feasts held in halls rather than on literary pursuits. Family ties within the elites were important, as were the virtues of loyalty, courage, and honour. These ties led to the prevalence of the feud in aristocratic society. Most feuds seem to have ended quickly with the payment of some sort of [[weregild|compensation]].<ref name=Wickham189>Wickham ''Inheritance of Rome'' pp. 189–193</ref>

Women took part in aristocratic society mainly in their roles as wives and mothers, with the role of mother of a ruler being especially prominent in [[Merovingian dynasty|Merovingian]] Gaul. In Anglo-Saxon society the lack of many child rulers meant a lesser role for women as queen mothers, but this was compensated for by the increased role played by [[abbess]]es of monasteries.<ref name=Wickham195>Wickham ''Inheritance of Rome'' pp. 195–199</ref> Women's influence on politics was particularly fragile, and early medieval authors tended to depict powerful women in a bad light.{{efn-ua|Among the powerful women, the Arian queen [[Goiswintha]] (d. 589) was a vehement but unsuccessful opponent of the Visigoth's conversion to Catholicism, and the Frankish queen [[Brunhilda of Austrasia]] (d. 613) was torn to pieces by horses at the age of 70.<ref name>Wickham ''Inheritance of Rome'' pp. 116, 197</ref>}}<ref name=Wickham116>Wickham ''Inheritance of Rome'' pp. 116, 195–197</ref> Women usually died at considerably younger age than men, primarily due to [[infanticide]] and [[maternal death|complications at childbirth]].{{efn-ua|Limited evidence from early medieval cemeteries indicates that the [[sex ratio]] at death was 120–130 men to 100 women in parts of Europe.<ref name=Bitel_24>Bitel, ''Women in Early Medieval Europe'', p. 24</ref>}} The disparity between the numbers of marriageable women and grown men led to the detailed regulation of legal institutions protecting women's interests, including their right to the {{lang|de|[[Morgengabe]]}}, or "morning gift".<ref name=Backman_120>Backman, ''Worlds of Medieval Europe'', p. 120</ref> Early medieval laws acknowledged a man's right to have long-term sexual relationships with women other than his wife, such as [[concubinage|concubines]], but women were expected to remain faithful. Clerics censured sexual unions outside marriage, and [[monogamy]] became also the norm of secular law in the 9th century.<ref name=Bitel_180_182>Bitel, ''Women in Early Medieval Europe'', pp. 180–182</ref>

[[File:Frühmittelalterliches Dorf.jpg|Reconstruction of an early medieval peasant village in Bavaria|thumb|upright=1.3|left]]

Most of the early medieval descriptions of the lower classes come from either [[Code (law)|law codes]] or writers from the upper classes. As few detailed written records documenting peasant life remain from before the 9th century, surviving information available to historians comes mainly from [[archaeology]].<ref name=Wickham204>Wickham ''Inheritance of Rome'' p. 204</ref> [[Landholding]] patterns were not uniform; some areas had greatly fragmented holdings, but in other areas large contiguous blocks of land were the norm. These differences allowed for a wide variety of peasant societies, some dominated by aristocratic landholders and others having a great deal of autonomy.<ref name=Wickham205>Wickham ''Inheritance of Rome'' pp. 205–210</ref> Land settlement also varied greatly. Some peasants lived in large settlements that numbered as many as 700 inhabitants. Others lived in small groups of a few families or on isolated farms.<ref name=Wickham211>Wickham ''Inheritance of Rome'' pp. 211–212</ref> Legislation made a clear distinction between free and unfree, but there was no sharp break between the legal status of the free peasant and the aristocrat, and it was possible for a free peasant's family to rise into the aristocracy over several generations through military service.<ref name=Wickham215>Wickham ''Inheritance of Rome'' p. 215</ref> Demand for slaves was covered through warring and raids. Initially, the Franks' expansion and conflicts between the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms supplied the slave market with prisoners of war and captives. After the Anglo-Saxons' conversion to Christianity, slave hunters mainly targeted the pagan Slav tribes—hence the English word "slave" from {{lang|la|slavicus}}, the [[Medieval Latin]] term for Slavs.<ref>McCormick ''Origins of the European Economy'' pp. 733–744</ref> Christian ethics brought about significant changes in the position of slaves in the 7th and 8th centuries. They were no more regarded as their lords' property, and their right to a decent treatment was enacted.<ref name=Backman119_120>Backman, ''Worlds of Medieval Europe'', pp. 119–120</ref>

Roman city life and culture changed greatly in the early Middle Ages. Although Italian cities remained inhabited, they contracted significantly in size. Rome, for instance, shrank from a population of hundreds of thousands to around 30,000 by the end of the 6th century. In Northern Europe, cities also shrank, while civic monuments and other public buildings were raided for building materials.<ref name=City3>Gies and Gies ''Life in a Medieval City'' pp. 3–4</ref> The Jewish communities survived the fall of the Western Roman Empire in Spain, southern Gaul and Italy. The Visigothic kings made concentrated efforts to convert the [[Sephardic Jews|Hispanic Jews]] to Christianity but the Jewish community [[Golden age of Jewish culture in Spain|quickly regenerated]] after the Muslim conquest.<ref>Chazan, ''The Jews of Medieval Western Christendom'' pp. 77–78, 90–93, 116–117</ref> In contrast, Christian legislation forbade the Jews' appointment to government positions.<ref>McCormick ''Origins of the European Economy'' p. 649</ref>

===Rise of Islam===

Religious beliefs were in flux in the lands along the Eastern Roman and Persian frontiers during the late 6th and early 7th centuries. State-sponsored Christian missionaries proselytised among the pagan steppe peoples, and the Persians made attempts to enforce [[Zoroastrianism]] on the Christian [[Armenians]]. Judaism was an active proselytising faith, and at least one [[Arabs|Arab]] political leader—[[Dhu Nuwas]], ruler of what is today [[Yemen]]—converted to it.<ref name=Collins136_141>Collins ''Early Medieval Europe'' pp. 136, 141–142</ref> The emergence of [[Islam]] in Arabia during the lifetime of [[Muhammad]] (d. 632) brought about more radical changes. After his death, Islamic forces conquered much of the Near East, starting with Syria in [[Muslim conquest of the Levant|634–35]], continuing with Persia between [[Muslim conquest of Persia|637 and 642]], and reaching Egypt in [[Muslim conquest of Egypt|640–41]]. In the eastern Mediterranean, the Eastern Romans halted the Muslim expansion at Constantinople in [[Siege of Constantinople (674–678)|674–78]] and [[Siege of Constantinople (717–718)|717–18]]. In the west, Islamic troops conquered North Africa by the early [[Muslim conquest of the Maghreb|8th century]], annihilated the Visigothic Kingdom in [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania|711]], and invaded southern France from [[Umayyad invasion of Gaul|713]].<ref name=Collins142>Collins ''Early Medieval Europe'' pp. 142–143, 150, 160</ref><ref name=Cunliffe421>Cunliffe ''Europe Between the Oceans'' pp. 421–423</ref>

The Muslim conquerors bypassed the mountainous northwestern region of the Iberian Peninsula. Here a small kingdom, [[Kingdom of Asturias|Asturias]] emerged as the centre of local resistance.<ref name=Collins376>Collins ''Early Medieval Europe'' pp. 376–377</ref> The defeat of Muslim forces at the [[Battle of Tours]] in 732 led to the reconquest of southern France by the Franks, but the main reason for the halt of Islamic growth in Europe was the overthrow of the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] and its replacement by the [[Abbasid Caliphate]]. The Abbasids were more concerned with the Middle East than Europe, losing control of sections of the Muslim lands. Umayyad descendants took over [[Al-Andalus]] (or Muslim Spain), the [[Aghlabids]] controlled North Africa, and the [[Tulunids]] became rulers of Egypt.<ref name=Brown15>Brown "Transformation of the Roman Mediterranean" ''Oxford Illustrated History of Medieval Europe'' p. 15</ref>

===Trade and economy===
{{main|Medieval economic history}}
Migrations and conquests disrupted trade networks around the Mediterranean. The replacement of goods from long-range trade with local products was a trend throughout the old Roman lands. Non-local goods appearing in the archaeological record are usually luxury goods or metalworks.<ref name=Wickham218>Wickham ''Inheritance of Rome'' pp. 218–219</ref> In the 7th and 8th centuries, new commercial networks were developing in northern Europe. Goods like furs, [[walrus ivory]] and amber were delivered from the Baltic region to western Europe, contributing to the development of new trade centers in East Anglia, northern Francia and Scandinavia. Conflicts over the control of trade routes and toll stations were common.<ref name=Collins347>Collins ''Early Medieval Europe'' pp. 347–348</ref> The various Germanic states in the west all had [[coin]]ages that imitated existing Roman and Byzantine forms.<ref name=Coin>Grierson "Coinage and currency" ''Middle Ages''</ref>

The flourishing Islamic economies' constant demand for fresh labour force and raw materials opened up a new market for Europe around 750. Europe emerged as a major supplier of [[house slave]]s and [[Mamluk|slave soldiers]] for Al-Andalus, northern Africa and the [[Levant]]. [[Venice]] developed into the most important European center of slave trade.<ref>Collins ''Early Medieval Europe'' p. 354</ref><ref>McCormick ''Origins of the European Economy'' pp. 753–754, 763</ref> In addition, timber, fur and arms were delivered from Europe to the Mediterranean, while Europe imported spices, medicine, incense, and silk from the Levant.<ref>McCormick ''Origins of the European Economy'' pp. 708–733</ref> The large rivers connecting distant regions facilitated the expansion of transcontinental trade.<ref>McCormick ''Origins of the European Economy'' pp. 791–792</ref> Contemporaneous reports indicate that Anglo-Saxon merchants visited fairs at Paris, pirates preyed on tradesman travelling on the Danube, and Eastern Frankish merchants reached as far as [[Zaragoza]] in Al-Andalus.<ref>McCormick ''Origins of the European Economy'' pp. 670–677</ref>

===Church life===
{{Main|Christianity in the Middle Ages}}

[[File:Gregory I - Antiphonary of Hartker of Sankt Gallen.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.3|An 11th-century illustration of [[Pope Gregory I|Gregory the Great]] dictating to a secretary, inspired by the [[Holy Spirit]]]]
The idea of Christian unity endured although differences in ideology and practice between the Eastern and Western Churches became apparent by the 6th century.<ref name="Brown41">Brown "Transformation of the Roman Mediterranean" ''Oxford Illustrated History of Medieval Europe'' p. 41</ref> The formation of new realms reinforced the traditional Christian concept of the [[separation of church and state]] in the west, whereas this notion was alien to eastern clergymen who regarded the Roman state as an instrument of divine providence.<ref name="Brown41" /> In the late 7th century, [[clerical marriage]] emerged as a permanent focus of controversy. After the Muslim conquests, the Byzantine emperors could less effectively intervene in the west. When [[Leo III the Isaurian|Leo III]] (r. 717–741) prohibited the display of paintings representing human figures in places of worship, the [[Pope|papacy]] openly rejected [[Caesaropapism|his claim]] to declare new dogmas by imperial edicts.<ref>Collins ''Early Medieval Europe'' pp. 218–233</ref> Although the Byzantine Church condemned [[Byzantine Iconoclasm|iconoclasm]] in 843, further issues such as fierce rivalry for ecclesiastic jurisdiction over newly converted peoples, and the [[filioque|unilateral modification]] of the [[Nicene Creed]] in the west widened to the extent that the differences were greater than the similarities.<ref>Brown "Transformation of the Roman Mediterranean" ''Oxford Illustrated History of Medieval Europe'' pp. 45–46</ref>

Few of the Western [[bishop]]s looked to the papacy for religious or political leadership. The only part of Western Europe where the papacy had influence was Britain, where Gregory had sent the [[Gregorian mission]] in 597 to convert the Anglo-Saxons to Christianity.<ref name="Wickham170_172">Wickham ''Inheritance of Rome'' pp. 170–172</ref> [[Hiberno-Scottish mission|Irish missionaries]] were most active in Western Europe between the 5th and the 7th centuries.<ref>Colish ''Medieval Foundations'' pp. 62–63</ref> People did not visit churches regularly. Instead, meetings with itinerant clergy and [[Christian pilgrimage|pilgrimages]] to popular saints' [[shrine]]s were instrumental in the spread of Christian teaching. Clergymen used special handbooks known as [[penitential]]s to determine the appropriate acts of [[penance]]—typically prayers, and [[Fasting and abstinence in the Catholic Church|fasts]]—for [[Christian views on sin|sinners]]. The Early Middle Ages witnessed the rise of [[Christian monasticism]]. Monastic ideals spread through [[Hagiography|hagiographical literature]], especially the ''[[Anthony the Great|Life of Anthony]]''. Most European monasteries were of the type that focuses on community experience of the spiritual life, called [[Cenobitic monasticism|cenobitism]].<ref>Lawrence ''Medieval Monasticism'' pp. 10–13</ref><ref>Collins ''Early Medieval Europe'' pp. 75–76</ref> The Italian monk [[Benedict of Nursia]] (d. 547) developed the [[Rule of Saint Benedict|Benedictine Rule]] which became widely used in western monasteries.<ref>Lawrence ''Medieval Monasticism'' pp. 18–24</ref><ref>Collins ''Early Medieval Europe'' pp. 237–240, 323</ref> In the east, the monastic rules compiled by [[Theodore the Studite]] (d. 826) gained popularity after they were adopted in the [[Great Lavra]] on [[Mount Athos]] in the 960s, setting a precedent for further Athonite monasteries, and turning the mount into the most important centre of Orthodox monasticism.<ref>Curta ''Eastern Europe in the Middle Ages'' pp. 322, 495</ref>

Monks and monasteries had a deep effect on religious and political life, in various cases acting as [[land trust]]s for powerful families and important centres of political authority.<ref name=Wickham185>Wickham ''Inheritance of Rome'' pp. 185–187</ref> They were the main and sometimes only outposts of education and literacy in a region. Many of the surviving manuscripts of the Latin [[Classics#Classical Rome|classics]] were copied in monasteries.<ref name=Hamilton43>Hamilton ''Religion in the Medieval West'' pp. 43–44</ref> Monks were also the authors of new works, including history, theology, and other subjects, written by authors such as [[Bede]] (d. 735), a native of northern England.<ref>Colish ''Medieval Foundations'' pp. 64–65</ref> The Byzantine missionary [[Saints Cyril and Methodius|Constantine]] (d. 869) developed [[Old Church Slavonic]] as a new [[liturgical language]], establishing the basis for flourishing Slavic religious literature; around 900 a new script was adopted, now known for Constantine's [[monastic name]] as [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]].<ref>Curta ''Eastern Europe in the Middle Ages'' pp. </ref>

In Western Christendom, [[laity|lay]] influence over Church affairs came to a climax in the 10th century. Aristocrats regarded the churches and monasteries under [[Jus patronatus|their patronage]] as [[proprietary church|their personal property]], and [[simony]]—the sale of Church offices—was a common practice. Simony aroused a general fear about [[Salvation in Christianity|salvation]] as many believed that irregularly appointed priests could not confer valid [[Sacraments of the Catholic Church|sacraments]] such as [[baptism]].<ref>Backman, ''Worlds of Medieval Europe'' pp. 214–216</ref> Monastic communities were the first to react to this fear by the rigorous observance of their rules. The establishment of [[Cluny Abbey]] in Burgundy in 909 initiated a more radical change as Cluny was freed from lay control and placed under the protection of the papacy. The [[Cluniac Reforms]] spread through the founding of new monasteries and the reform of monastic life in old abbeys.<ref>Hamilton ''Religion in the Medieval West'' p. 45</ref> Cluny's example indicated that the reformist idea of the "[[libertas ecclesiae|Liberty of the Church]]" could be achieved through submission to the papacy.<ref>Barber ''Two Cities'' p. 87</ref>

===Carolingian Europe===
{{main|Francia|Carolingian Empire}}

[[File:Frankish Empire 481 to 814-en.svg|thumb|upright= 1.5|Map showing growth of Frankish power from 481 to 814|left]]

The Merovingian kings customarily distributed Francia among their sons and destroyed their own power base by extensive land grants. In the northeastern Frankish realm [[Austrasia]], the [[Arnulfings]] were the most prominent beneficiaries of royal favour. As hereditary [[Mayor of the Palace|Mayors of the Palace]], they were the power behind the Austrasian throne from the mid-7th century. One of them, [[Pepin of Herstal]] (d. 714), also assumed power in the central Frankish realm [[Neustria]]. His son [[Charles Martel]] (d. 741) took advantage of the permanent Muslim threat to confiscate church property and raise new troops by parcelling it out among the recruits.<ref name=Backman150_154>Backman, ''Worlds of Medieval Europe'', pp. 150–154</ref>

The [[Carolingian dynasty|Carolingians]], as Charles Martel's descendants are known, succeeded the Merovingians as the new royal dynasty of Francia in 751. This year the last Merovingian king [[Childeric III]] (r. 743–751) was deposed, and Charles Martel's son [[Pepin the Short]] (r. 751–768) was crowned king with the consent of the Frankish leaders and the papacy. Pepin attacked the Lombards and enforced their promise to respect the [[Patrimony of Saint Peter|possessions of the papacy]]. His subsequent [[Donation of Pepin|donation of Central Italian territories]] to the [[Holy See]] marked the beginnings of the [[Papal States]].<ref name=Collins276_277>Collins ''Early Medieval Europe'' pp. 276–278</ref><ref name=Brown97_99>Brown "Transformation of the Roman Mediterranean" ''Oxford Illustrated History of Medieval Europe'' pp. 97–99</ref>

Pepin left his kingdom in the hands of his two sons, Charles, more often known as [[Charlemagne]] or Charles the Great (r. 768–814), and [[Carloman I|Carloman]] (r. 768–771). When Carloman died of natural causes, Charlemagne reunited Francia and embarked upon a programme of systematic expansion, rewarding allies with war booty and command over parcels of land. He [[Saxon Wars|subjugated the Saxons]], conquered the Lombards, and created a [[Marca Hispanica|new border province]] in northern Spain.<ref name=Collins280_288>Collins ''Early Medieval Europe'' pp. 280–288</ref> Between 791 and 803, Frankish troops [[Avar Wars|destroyed]] the Avars which facilitated the development of small Slavic principalities, mainly ruled by ambitious warlords under Frankish suzerainty.<ref name=Curta103>Curta ''Eastern Europe in the Middle Ages'' pp.&nbsp;103–110.</ref>{{efn-ua|Examples include [[Ljudevit (Lower Pannonia)|Liudewit]] (d. 823) who ruled the lands along the [[Sava]] river, and [[Pribina]] (d. 861) whose domains were located in the [[March of Pannonia]].<ref name=Curta105>Curta ''Eastern Europe in the Middle Ages'' pp.&nbsp;105–110.</ref>}} The coronation of Charlemagne as emperor on Christmas Day 800 marked a return of the Western Roman Empire and asserted the Frankish realm's equivalence to the Byzantine state. In 812, as a result of careful and protracted negotiations, the Byzantines acknowledged Charlemagne's new title but without recognizing him as a second "emperor of the Romans".<ref name=Backman109>Backman ''Worlds of Medieval Europe'' pp. 109–111</ref>

The Carolingian Empire was administered by an itinerant court that travelled with the emperor, as well as approximately 300 imperial officials called [[count]]s, who administered the [[county|counties]] the empire had been divided into.<ref name=Davies302>Davies ''Europe'' p. 302</ref> The central administration supervised the counts through imperial emissaries called ''[[Missus dominicus|missi dominici]]'', who served as roving inspectors and troubleshooters. The clerics of the [[royal chapel]] were responsible for recording important royal grants and decisions.<ref name=Collins306>Collins ''Early Medieval Europe'' p. 306</ref> Charlemagne's court in [[Aachen]] was the centre of the cultural revival sometimes referred to as the "[[Carolingian Renaissance]]". Literacy increased, as did development in the arts, architecture and jurisprudence, as well as liturgical and scriptural studies. Charlemagne's [[Chancery (medieval office)|chancery]]—or writing office—made use of a new [[Writing system|script]] today known as [[Carolingian minuscule]],{{efn-ua|The [[Carolingian minuscule]] was developed from the [[uncial script]] of Late Antiquity, which was a smaller, rounder form of writing the [[Latin alphabet]] than the classical forms.<ref name=Davies241>Davies ''Europe'' p. 241</ref>}} allowing a common writing style that advanced communication across much of Europe.

Charlemagne sponsored changes in [[Christian liturgy|church liturgy]], imposing the Roman form of church service on his domains, as well as the [[Gregorian chant]] in liturgical music for the churches. An important activity for scholars during this period was the copying, correcting, and dissemination of basic works on religious and secular topics, with the aim of encouraging learning. New works on religious topics and schoolbooks were also produced.<ref name=Colish66>Colish ''Medieval Foundations'' pp. 66–70</ref> [[Linguistics|Grammarians]] of the period modified the Latin language, changing it from the [[Classical Latin]] of the Roman Empire into a more flexible form now called [[Medieval Latin]].<ref name=Lang>Loyn "Language and dialect" ''Middle Ages'' p. 204</ref>

Charlemagne continued the Frankish tradition of dividing his empire between all his sons, but only one son, [[Louis the Pious]] (r. 814–840), was still alive by 813. Just before Charlemagne died in 814, he made Louis co-emperor. Louis's reign was marked by numerous divisions of the empire among his sons, and civil wars between various alliances of father and sons over the control of various parts of the empire.<ref name=Collins318_330>Collins ''Early Medieval Europe'' pp. 318–330</ref>

By the [[Treaty of Verdun]] (843), a kingdom between the [[Rhine]] and [[Rhone]] rivers was created for [[Lothair I]] to go with his lands in Italy, and his imperial title was recognised. [[Louis the German]] was in control of Bavaria and the eastern lands in modern-day Germany.

Frankish culture and the Carolingian methods of state administration had a significant impact on the neighboring peoples. Frankish threat triggered the formation of new states along the empire's eastern frontier—[[Duchy of Bohemia|Bohemia]], [[Great Moravia|Moravia]], and [[Duchy of Croatia|Croatia]].<ref name=Wickham488>Wickham ''Inheritance of Rome'' pp. 488–489</ref> The breakup of the Carolingian Empire was accompanied by invasions, migrations, and raids by external foes. The Atlantic and northern shores were harassed by the [[Vikings]], who also raided the British Isles and settled there. In 911, the Viking chieftain [[Rollo]] (d. {{Circa|931}}) received permission from the Frankish king [[Charles the Simple]] (r. 898–922) to settle in what became [[Normandy]]. The eastern parts of the Frankish kingdoms, especially Germany and Italy, were under continual [[Hungarian invasions of Europe|Magyar assault]] until the invaders' defeat at the [[Battle of Lechfeld]] in 955.<ref name=Backman191_199>Backman ''Worlds of Medieval Europe'' pp. 191–199</ref> In the Mediterranean, Arab pirates launched regular raids against Italy and southern France.

Under Constantine the Great and his successors, [[basilica]]s, large halls that had been used for administrative and commercial purposes, were adapted for Christian worship, and new basilicas were built in the major Roman cities and the post-Roman kingdoms.{{efn-ua|Examples include a 4th-century basilica uncovered under the [[Barcelona Cathedral]], the five-aisled [[Cathedral of Saint Étienne, Paris|Cathedral of Saint Étienne]] in Paris, and the huge [[Basilica of Sant'Apollinare in Classe]] in [[Ravenna]].<ref>Stalley ''Early Medieval Architecture'' pp. 28–29</ref>}}<ref>Stalley ''Early Medieval Architecture'' pp. 21–29</ref> In the late 6th century, Byzantine church architecture adopted an alternative model imitating the rectangular plan and the [[dome]] of Justinian's [[Hagia Sophia]], the largest single roofed structure of the Roman world.<ref>Wickham ''Inheritance of Rome'' pp. 232–233</ref> As the spacious basilicas became of little use with the decline of urban centres in the west, they gave way to smaller churches. By the beginning of the 8th century, the Carolingian Empire revived the basilica form of architecture.<ref>Stalley ''Early Medieval Architecture'' pp. 21–44</ref> One new standard feature of Carolingian basilicas is the use of a [[transept]], or the "arms" of a T-shaped building that are perpendicular to the long [[nave]].<ref>Stalley ''Early Medieval Architecture'' pp. 43–44</ref>

Magnificent halls built of timber or stone were the centres of political and social life all over the early Middle Ages. Their design often adopted elements of Late Roman architecture like [[pilaster]]s, columns, and sculptured discs.{{efn-ua|Examples include Charlemagne's [[Palace of Aachen|palace at Aachen]], the Carolingian [[Aula regia|royal palace at Ingelheim]], and the Asturian [[Santa María del Naranco|kings' palace at Oviedo]].<ref name=Stalley96_97/>}}<ref name=Stalley96_97>Stalley ''Early Medieval Architecture'' pp. 96–97</ref> After the disintegration of the Carolingian Empire, the spread of aristocratic castles indicates a transition from communal fortifications to private defence in western Europe. Most castles were wooden structures but the wealthiest lords could afford the building of stone fortresses.{{efn-ua|An early example of stone fortresses is [[Château de Doué-la-Fontaine|the residential keep]] built by [[Theobald I, Count of Blois]] (d. 975) around 950.<ref>Stalley ''Early Medieval Architecture'' pp. 88–89</ref>}} One or more towers, now known as [[keep]]s, were the most characteristic features of a medieval fortress. Castles often developed into multifunctional compounds with their [[drawbridge]]s, fortified courtyards, [[cistern]]s or wells, halls, chapels, stables and workshops.<ref>Stalley ''Early Medieval Architecture'' pp. 83–90</ref>

[[Carolingian art]] was dominated by efforts to regain the dignity and classicism of imperial Roman and [[Byzantine art]], but was also influenced by the [[Insular art]] of the British Isles. Insular art integrated the energy of [[Celtic art|Irish Celtic]] and [[Anglo-Saxon art|Anglo-Saxon Germanic]] styles of ornament with Mediterranean forms such as the book, and established many characteristics of art for the rest of the medieval period. Surviving religious works from the Early Middle Ages are mostly [[illuminated manuscript]]s and carved [[Ivory carving#Antiquity and the Early Medieval period|ivories]].<ref>Kitzinger ''Early Medieval Art'' pp. 36–53, 61–64</ref><ref name=Henderson18>Henderson ''Early Medieval'' pp. 18–21, 63–71</ref> Objects in precious metals were the most prestigious form of art, but almost all are lost except for a few crosses such as the [[Cross of Lothair]], several [[Reliquary|reliquaries]], and finds such as the Anglo-Saxon burial at [[Sutton Hoo]] and the [[hoard]]s of [[Treasure of Gourdon|Gourdon]] from Merovingian France, [[Treasure of Guarrazar|Guarrazar]] from Visigothic Spain and [[Treasure of Nagyszentmiklós|Nagyszentmiklós]] near Byzantine territory.{{dubious|reason=Near Byzantine territory?

===Military and technology===
During the later Roman Empire, the principal military developments were attempts to create an effective cavalry force as well as the continued development of highly specialised types of troops. The creation of heavily armoured [[cataphract]]-type soldiers as cavalry was an important feature of the Late Roman military. The various invading tribes had differing emphases on types of soldiers—ranging from the primarily infantry Anglo-Saxon invaders of Britain to the Vandals and Visigoths who had a high proportion of cavalry in their armies.<ref>Nicolle ''Medieval Warfare Source Book: Warfare in Western Christendom'' pp. 28–29</ref> The greatest change in military affairs during the invasion period was the adoption of the Hunnic [[composite bow]] in place of the earlier, and weaker, [[Scythia]]n composite bow.<ref>Nicolle ''Medieval Warfare Source Book: Warfare in Western Christendom'' pp. 30–31</ref> The Avar [[heavy cavalry]] introduced the use of [[stirrup]]s in Europe,<ref>Curta ''Eastern Europe in the Middle Ages'' p. 52</ref> and it was adopted by Byzantine cavalrymen before the end of the 6th century.<ref>Nicolle ''Medieval Warfare Source Book: Warfare in Western Christendom'' p. 41</ref> Another development was the increasing use of [[longsword]]s and the progressive replacement of [[scale armour]] by [[Mail (armour)|mail]] and [[lamellar armour]].<ref>Nicolle ''Medieval Warfare Source Book: Warfare in Western Christendom'' pp. 34, 39</ref>

The importance of infantry and light cavalry began to decline during the early Carolingian period, with a growing dominance of elite heavy cavalry. Although much of the Carolingian armies were mounted, a large proportion during the early period appear to have been [[mounted infantry]], rather than true cavalry.<ref>Nicolle ''Medieval Warfare Source Book: Warfare in Western Christendom'' pp. 58, 76</ref> The use of [[Conscription|militia-type levies]] of the free population declined. One exception was Anglo-Saxon England, where the armies were still composed of regional levies, known as the ''[[fyrd]]''.<ref>Nicolle ''Medieval Warfare Source Book: Warfare in Western Christendom'' pp. 59, 67</ref> In military technology, one of the main changes was the reappearance of the [[crossbow]] as a military weapon.<ref name=NicolleWestern80>Nicolle ''Medieval Warfare Source Book: Warfare in Western Christendom'' p. 80</ref> A technological advance that had implications beyond the military was the [[horseshoe]], which allowed horses to be used in rocky terrain.<ref>Nicolle ''Medieval Warfare Source Book: Warfare in Western Christendom'' pp. 41, 88–91</ref>

==High Middle Ages==
{{main|High Middle Ages}}

===Society===
{{see|Agriculture in the Middle Ages}}
[[File:Cleric-Knight-Workman.jpg|13th-century French [[historiated initial]] with the three [[Social class|classes]] of medieval society: those who prayed (the [[clergy]]) those who fought (the [[knight]]s), and those who worked (the [[peasant]]ry).<ref name=Whitton134>Whitton "Society of Northern Europe" ''Oxford Illustrated History of Medieval Europe'' p. 134</ref>|thumb|left]]
The High Middle Ages was a period of tremendous [[Medieval demography|population expansion]]. The estimated population of Europe grew from 35 to 80&nbsp;million between 1000 and 1347, although the exact causes remain unclear: improved agricultural techniques, [[assarting]] (or bringing new lands into production), a [[Medieval Warm Period|more clement climate]] and the lack of invasion have all been suggested.<ref name=Jordan5_10>Jordan ''Europe in the High Middle Ages'' pp. 5–10</ref><ref>Backman ''Worlds of Medieval Europe'' p. 221</ref> Most medieval western thinkers divided the society into three [[social class|fundamental classes]]. These were the clergy, the [[nobility]], and the peasantry (or commoners).<ref>Singman ''Daily Life'' p. 11</ref><ref>Barber ''Two Cities'' pp. 25–26, 42</ref> [[Feudalism]] regulated fundamental social relations in many parts of Europe. In this system, one party granted property, typically land to the other in return for services, mostly of military nature that the recipient, or [[vassal]], had to render to the grantor, or lord.<ref>Backman ''Worlds of Medieval Europe'' pp. 247–249</ref><ref>Singman ''Daily Life'' pp. 4–6</ref> In Germany, inalienable [[allod]]s remained the dominant forms of landholding. Their owners owed [[homage (feudal)|homage]] to a higher-ranking aristocrat or the king but their landholding was free of feudal obligations.<ref>Singman ''Daily Life'' p. 6</ref>

As much as 90&nbsp;per cent of the European population remained rural peasants. Many were no longer settled in isolated farms but had gathered into more defensible small communities, usually known as [[Manorialism|manor]]s or villages.<ref name=Jordan5_10/><ref>Backman ''Worlds of Medieval Europe'' pp. 220–221</ref> In the system of manorialism, a manor was the basic unit of landholding, and it comprised smaller components, such as parcels held by peasant tenants, and the lord's [[demesne]].<ref>Singman ''Daily Life'' pp. 6–7</ref> Slaveholding was declining as churchmen prohibited the enslavement of coreligionists, but a new form of dependency ([[serfdom]]) supplanted it by the late 11th century. Unlike slaves, serfs had [[legal capacity]], and their hereditary status was regulated by agreements with their lords. Restrictions on their activities varied but their freedom of movement was customarily limited, and they usually owed {{lang|fr|[[corvée]]s}}, or labor services.<ref>Jordan ''Europe in the High Middle Ages'' pp. 10-12</ref><ref>Backman ''Worlds of Medieval Europe'' pp. 221-222</ref> Peasants left their homelands in return for significant economic and legal privileges, typically a lower level of taxation and the right to administer justice at local level. The crossborder movement of masses of peasantry had radical demographic consequences, such as the [[Ostsiedlung|spread of German settlements]] to the east, and the expansion of the Christian population in Iberia.<ref>Bartlett ''The Making of Europe'' pp. 111–123</ref>      

With the development of heavy cavalry, the previously more or less uniform class of free warriors split into two groups. Those who could equip themselves as mounted [[knight]]s were integrated into the traditional aristocracy, but others were assimilated into the peasantry.<ref>Singman ''Daily Life'' p. 2</ref> The position of the new aristocracy was stabilized through the adoption of strict inheritance customs, such as [[primogeniture]]—the eldest son's right to inherit the family domains undivided.<ref>Barber ''Two Cities'' pp. 37–41</ref> Nobles were stratified in terms of the land and people over whom they held authority; the lowest-ranking nobles did not hold land and had to serve wealthier aristocrats.{{efn-ua|In France, Germany, and the Low Countries there was a further type of "noble", the {{lang|la|[[ministerialis]]}}, who were in effect unfree knights. They descended from serfs who had served as warriors or government officials, which increased status allowed their descendants to hold fiefs as well as become knights while still being technically serfs.<ref name="Singman8"/>}}<ref>Singman ''Daily Life'' p. 3</ref> Although constituting only about one per cent of the population, the nobility was never a closed group: kings could raise commoners to the aristocracy, wealthy commoners could marry into noble families, and impoverished aristocrats sometimes gave up their privileged status.<ref>Barber ''Two Cities'' p. 40</ref> The constant movement of Western aristocrats towards the peripheries of Latin Christendom was a featuring element of high medieval society. The French-speaking noblemen mainly settled in the British Isles, southern Italy or Iberia, whereas the German aristocrats preferred Central and Eastern Europe. Their migration was often supported by the local rulers who highly appreciated their military skills, but in many cases the newcomers were conquerors who established new lordships by force.{{efn-ua|For instance, the [[Anglo-Normans|Anglo-Norman]] aristocrat [[Robert de Brus, 1st Lord of Annandale|Robert Bruce]] (d. 1141) received the [[Lord of Annandale|Lordship of Annandale]] in southern Scotland from [[David I of Scotland|King David I]] (r. 1124–1153), whereas [[John de Courcy]] (d. 1219), also an Anglo-Norman knight, seized [[Ulaid]] in Ireland by force.<ref>Bartlett ''The Making of Europe'' pp. 32, 79</ref>}}<ref>Bartlett ''The Making of Europe'' pp. 24–39</ref>

The clergy was divided into two types: the [[secular clergy]], who cared for believers' spiritual needs, mainly serving in the [[parish church]]es; and the [[regular clergy]], who lived under a religious rule as monks, [[Canon (clergy)|canons]], or [[friar]]s. Throughout the period clerics remained a very small proportion of the population, usually about one per cent. Churchmen supervised several aspects of everyday life, [[church court]]s had exclusive jurisdiction over marriage affairs,<ref>Singman ''Daily Life'' pp. 11–12</ref> and church authorities supported popular [[Peace and Truce of God|peace movements]].<ref>Backman ''Worlds of Medieval Europe'' p. 252</ref>

Women were officially required to be subordinate to some male, whether their father, husband, or other kinsman. Women's work generally consisted of household or other domestically inclined tasks such as child-care. Peasant women could supplement the household income by spinning or brewing at home, and they were also expected to help with field-work at harvest-time.<ref>Singman ''Daily Life'' pp. 14–15</ref> Townswomen could engage in trade but often only by right of their husband, and unlike their male competitors, they were not always allowed to train apprentices.<ref>Singman ''Daily Life'' pp. 177–178</ref> Noblewomen could inherit land in the absence of a male heir but their potential to give birth to children was regarded as their principal virtue.<ref>Barber ''Two Cities'' pp. 41–42</ref> The only role open to women in the Church was that of [[nun]]s, as they were unable to become priests.<ref>Singman ''Daily Life'' p. 15</ref>

The expansion of population, greater agricultural productivity and relative political stability laid the foundations for the medieval "[[Commercial Revolution]]" in the 11th century.<ref name=Barber_58>Barber ''Two Cities'' p. 58</ref> People with surplus cash began investing in commodities like salt, pepper and silk at faraway markets.<ref>Epstein ''Economic and Social History'' pp. 74–85</ref> Rising trade brought new methods of dealing with money, and gold coinage was again minted in Europe, first in Italy and later in France. New forms of commercial contracts emerged, allowing risk to be shared within the framework of [[partnership]]s known as {{lang|it|[[commenda]]}} or {{lang|it|compagnia}}.<ref>Barber ''Two Cities'' pp. 70–71</ref> [[Bill of exchange|Bills of exchange]] also appeared, enabling easy transmission of money. As many types of coins were in circulation, [[money changer]]s facilitated transactions between local and foreign merchants. Loans could also be negotiated with them which gave rise to the development of credit institutions called banks.<ref>Epstein ''Economic and Social History'' pp. 83, 89</ref> As new towns were developing from local commercial centres, the economic growth brought about a new wave of urbanisation. Kings and aristocrats mainly supported the process in the hope of increased tax revenues.<ref>Epstein ''Economic and Social History'' pp. 100–103</ref> Most urban communities received privileges acknowledging their autonomy, but few cities could get rid of all elements of royal or aristocratic control.<ref name=Barber48>Barber ''Two Cities'' pp. 48–49</ref> Throughout the Middle Ages the population of the towns probably never exceeded 10 per cent of the total population.<ref name=Daily171>Singman ''Daily Life'' p. 171</ref>

The Italian [[maritime republics]] such as [[Duchy of Amalfi|Amalfi]], Venice, [[Republic of Genoa|Genoa]], and [[Republic of Pisa|Pisa]] were the first to profit from the revival of commerce in the Mediterranean.<ref>Barber ''Two Cities'' pp. 58, 72</ref> In the north, German merchants established associations known as {{lang|de|hansas}} and took control of the trade routes connecting the British Islands and the [[Low Countries]] with Scandinavia and Eastern Europe.<ref>Barber ''Two Cities'' p. 61</ref>{{efn-ua|These two groups—Germans and Italians—took different approaches to their trading arrangements. Most German cities co-operated when dealing with the northern rulers; in contrast with the Italian city-states who engaged in internecine strife. For instance, conflicts between Italian, [[Catalans|Catalan]] and [[Provence|Provençal]] merchant communities culminated in the [[War of Saint Sabas]] in the Levant in 1257.<ref>Epstein ''Economic and Social History'' pp. 78–81</ref>}} Great [[Fair|trading fairs]] were established and flourished [[Champagne fairs|in northern France]], allowing Italian and German merchants to trade with each other as well as local merchants.<ref>Epstein ''Economic and Social History'' pp. 78–83</ref> In the late 13th century new land and sea routes to the Far East were pioneered, famously described in ''[[The Travels of Marco Polo]]'' written by one of the traders, [[Marco Polo]] (d. 1324).<ref>Barber ''Two Cities'' pp. 60–67</ref>

Economic growth provided opportunities to Jewish merchants to spread all over Europe. Although most kings, bishops and aristocrats appreciated the Jews' contribution to the local economy, many commoners regarded the non-Christian newcomers as an imminent threat to social cohesion.<ref>Chazan, ''The Jews of Medieval Western Christendom'' pp. 209–212, 219–222</ref> As the Jews could not engage in prestigious trades outside their communities, they often took despised jobs such as ragmen or tax collectors.<ref>Epstein ''Economic and Social History'' p. 107</ref> They were especially active in moneylending for they could ignore the Christian clerics' condemnation on loan interest.<ref>Chazan, ''The Jews of Medieval Western Christendom'' pp. 217–218</ref> The Jewish moneylenders and pawn brokers reinforced [[antisemitism]], which led to accusations of blasphemy, [[blood libel]]s, and [[pogrom]]s. Church authorities' growing concerns about Jewish influence on Christian life inspired segregationist laws,{{efn-ua|The Jews were required to wear a [[Yellow badge|distinctive badge]] on their cloths and to live in [[Jewish quarter (diaspora)|their own districts]] in the towns.<ref>Chazan, ''The Jews of Medieval Western Christendom'' p. 213</ref>}} and even their permanent expulsion [[Edict of Expulsion|from England]] in 1290.<ref>Chazan, ''The Jews of Medieval Western Christendom'' pp. 166–167, 213–214</ref>

The spread of [[horse collar]] led to the use of [[Working animal|draught horses]] that required less pastures than oxen.<ref>Backman ''Worlds of Medieval Europe'' p. 225</ref> Legumes—such as peas, beans, or lentils—were grown more widely, in addition to the cereal crops.<ref>Barber ''Two Cities'' p. 76</ref>

The construction of [[cathedral]]s and castles advanced building technology, leading to the development of large stone buildings. Ancillary structures included new town halls, hospitals, bridges, and [[tithe barn]]s.<ref>Barber ''Two Cities'' p. 64</ref> Shipbuilding improved with the use of the [[Boat building|rib and plank]] method rather than the old Roman system of [[mortise and tenon]]. Other improvements to ships included the use of [[lateen]] sails and the [[rudder#Medieval Europe|stern-post rudder]], both of which increased the speed at which ships could be sailed.<ref>Barber ''Two Cities'' pp. 69–70</ref>

In military affairs, the use of infantry with specialised roles increased. Along with the still-dominant heavy cavalry, armies often included mounted and infantry [[crossbowmen]], as well as [[sapper]]s and engineers.<ref>Nicolle ''Medieval Warfare Source Book: Warfare in Western Christendom'' p. 125</ref> Crossbows increased in use partly because of the increase in [[siege]] warfare.<ref name="NicolleWestern80" />{{efn-ua|Crossbows are slow to reload, which limits their use on open battlefields.

In the early 11th century, [[Papal selection before 1059|papal elections]] were [[Tusculan Papacy|controlled by]] Roman aristocrats, but Emperor [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry III]] (r. 1039–56) broke their power and placed [[Gregorian Reform|reform-minded]] clerics on the papal throne. They achieved the acknowledgement of their supreme jurisdiction in church affairs in many parts of Europe.<ref>Backman, ''Worlds of Medieval Europe'' pp. 298–300</ref> In contrast, the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|head of the Byzantine Church]] Patriarch [[Michael I Cerularius]] (d. 1059) refused [[papal supremacy]] for which a [[papal legate]] excommunicated him in 1054.

Lay [[investiture]]—the appointment of clerics by secular rulers—was condemned at an assembly of bishops in Rome in 1059, and the same [[synod]] established the exclusive right of the [[College of Cardinals]] to elect the popes.<ref>Backman, ''Worlds of Medieval Europe'' pp. 295–301</ref> Henry's son and successor [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] (r. 1056–1105) wanted to preserve the right to appoint his own choices as bishops within his lands but his appointments outraged Pope [[Pope Gregory VII|Gregory VII]] (pope 1073–85). Their quarrel developed into the [[Investiture Controversy]], involving other powers as well because kings did not relinquish the control of appointments to bishoprics voluntarily.

The High Middle Ages saw the development of institutions that would dominate political life in Europe until the late 18th century.

Their hold of the territory [[Treaty of Melfi|was recognised]] by the papacy in 1059, and [[Roger II of Sicily|Roger II]] (r. 1105–54) united these lands into the [[Kingdom of Sicily]].<ref>Barber ''Two Cities'' pp. 206–210</ref> The papacy, long attached to an ideology of independence from secular influence, first asserted its claim to temporal authority over the entire Christian world, but this new identity led to conflicts with the western emperors and Italian rulers.<ref>Hamilton ''Religion in the Medieval West'' p. 7</ref> The [[Temporal power (papal)|Papal Monarchy]] reached its apogee under the pontificate of {{nowrap|[[Pope Innocent III|Innocent III]]}} (pope 1198–1216).<ref>Backman ''Worlds of Medieval Europe'' pp. 371–379</ref> 

In the [[Holy Roman Empire]], the Ottonians were replaced by the [[Salian dynasty|Salians]] in 1024. They protected the lesser nobility to reduce the German dukes' power and seized Burgundy before clashing with the papacy under Henry IV.<ref>Backman ''Worlds of Medieval Europe'' pp. 259–260</ref> After a short interval between 1125 and 1137, the [[Hohenstaufen]]s succeeded the Salians. Their recurring conflicts with the papacy allowed the northern Italian cities and the German [[Imperial Estate|ecclesiastic and secular princes]] to extort considerable concessions from the emperors. In 1183, [[Frederick I Barbarossa|{{nowrap|Frederick I}} Barbarossa]] (r. 1155–90) [[Peace of Constance|sanctioned the right]] of the [[Lombard League|Lombard cities]] to elect their leaders; the German princes' judicial and economic privileges [[Statutum in favorem principum|were confirmed]] during the reign of his grandson {{nowrap|[[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]]}} (r. 1220–50).<ref>Barber ''Two Cities'' pp. 182–203</ref> Frederick was famed for his erudition and unconventional life style{{efn-ua|{{nowrap|Frederick II}} had a [[harem]], was dressed in Arab-style garments, and wore a mantle decorated with [[Āyah|verses from the Quran]] during his imperial coronation in Rome.<ref>Backman ''Worlds of Medieval Europe'' p. 411</ref>}} but his efforts to rule Italy eventually led to the fall of his dynasty. In Germany, a period of interregnum, or rather civil war began, whereas Sicily—Frederick's maternal inheritance—was seized by an ambitious French prince [[Charles I of Anjou]] (r. 1266–85).<ref>Backman ''Worlds of Medieval Europe'' pp. 409–413</ref> During the German civil war, the right of seven [[prince-elector]]s to elect the king was reaffirmed.

Clashes with secular powers during the Investiture Controversy accelerated the militarization of the papacy.

[[Cathedral chapter]]s were expected to operate a school from the late 11th century. As students of the traditional [[monastic school]]s lived under strict rules, the more lenient [[cathedral school]]s quickly marginalised them. Schools reaching the highest level of mastery within the disciplines they taught received the rank of {{lang|la|[[studium generale]]}}, or [[medieval university|university]] from the pope or the Holy Roman Emperor.<ref>Backman ''Worlds of Medieval Europe'' pp. 345–348</ref><ref>Barber ''Two Cities'' pp. 409–410</ref> The new institutions of education encouraged scholarly discussions.<ref>Colish ''Medieval Foundations'' p. 265</ref> Debates between the [[Philosophical realism|realists]] and the [[Nominalism|nominalists]] over the concept of "[[Universal (metaphysics)|universals]]" were especially heated. Philosophical discourse was stimulated by the rediscovery of [[Aristotle]] and his emphasis on [[empiricism]] and [[rationalism]]. Scholars such as [[Peter Abelard]] (d. 1142) and [[Peter Lombard]] (d. 1164) introduced [[Term logic|Aristotelian logic]] into theology.<ref>Backman ''Worlds of Medieval Europe'' pp. 324–333</ref> [[Scholasticism]], the new method of intellectual discourse and pedagogy, required the study of authoritative texts, notably the [[Vulgate]] and [[Church Fathers|patristic]] literature, but references to them could no more override rational argumentation.<ref>Backman ''Worlds of Medieval Europe'' pp. 433–434</ref> Scholastic academics summarized their and other authors' views on specific subjects in comprehensive sentence collections known as {{lang|la|[[summa|summae]]}}, including the {{lang|la|[[Summa Theologica]]}} by [[Thomas Aquinas]] (d. 1274).<ref>Colish ''Medieval Foundations'' pp. 266, 295–301</ref>

[[Chivalry]] and the ethos of [[courtly love]] developed in royal and noble courts. This culture was expressed in the [[Vernacular|vernacular languages]] rather than Latin, and comprised poems, stories, legends, and popular songs. Often the stories were written down in the {{lang|fr|[[Chanson de geste|chansons de geste]]}}, or "songs of great deeds", such as ''[[The Song of Roland]]''. In contrast, [[chivalric romance]] praised chaste love, while eroticism was mainly present in poems composed by [[troubadour]]s.<ref>Backman ''Worlds of Medieval Europe'' pp. 352–359</ref><ref>Barber ''Two Cities'' pp. 413–414</ref> Chivalric literature took inspiration from [[classical mythology]], and also from the Celtic legends of the [[Arthurian cycle]] collected by [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]] (d. {{Circa|1155}}) in his {{lang|la|[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]}}.<ref>Colish ''Medieval Foundations'' p. 182</ref> Further featuring literary genres include spiritual [[autobiography|autobiographies]], [[chronicle]]s, philosophical poems, and [[hymn]]s.{{efn-ua|Examples include the spiritual works of [[Guibert of Nogent]] (d. {{Circa|1125}}), the lyric correspondence between Abelard and his former lover [[Héloïse]] (d. {{Circa|1164}}), ''The Two Cities'' by [[Otto of Freising]] (d. 1158), the poems of [[Alan of Lille]] (d. 1202/03), and {{lang|la|[[Stabat Mater]]}}, a hymn to Virgin Mary.<ref name=Colish178_182/>}}<ref name=Colish178_182>Colish ''Medieval Foundations'' pp. 178–182</ref>

The discovery of a copy of the {{lang|la|Corpus Juris Civilis}} in the 11th century paved the way for the systematic study of Roman law at [[University of Bologna|Bologna]]. This led to the recording and standardisation of legal codes throughout Western Europe. Around 1140, the monk Gratian (fl. 12th century), a teacher at Bologna, wrote what became the standard text of ecclesiastical law, or [[canon law]]—the {{lang|la|[[Decretum Gratiani]]}}.<ref>Backman ''Worlds of Medieval Europe'' pp. 333–337</ref> Among the results of the Greek and Islamic influence on this period in European history was the replacement of [[Roman numerals]] with the [[decimal]] [[Positional notation|positional number system]] and the invention of [[algebra]], which allowed more advanced mathematics. Astronomy benefited from the translation of [[Ptolemy]]'s ''[[Almagest]]'' from Greek into Latin in the late 12th century. Medicine was also studied, especially in southern Italy, where Islamic medicine influenced the [[Schola Medica Salernitana|school at Salerno]].<ref>Backman ''Worlds of Medieval Europe'' pp. 343–344</ref>

In the 10th century the establishment of churches and monasteries led to the development of stone architecture that elaborated vernacular Roman forms, from which the term "Romanesque" is derived. Where available, Roman brick and stone buildings were recycled for their materials. From the tentative beginnings known as the [[First Romanesque]], the style flourished and spread across Europe in a remarkably homogeneous form.

Romanesque art, especially metalwork, was at its most sophisticated in [[Mosan art]], in which distinct artistic personalities including [[Nicholas of Verdun]] (d. 1205) become apparent, and an almost [[Ancient Greek art|classical style]] is seen in works such as a [[Baptismal font at St Bartholomew's Church, Liège|font at Liège]].<ref name=Lasko240>Lasko ''Ars Sacra'' pp. 240–250</ref> Large illuminated bibles and [[psalter]]s were the typical forms of luxury manuscripts.<ref name=Benton91>Benton ''Art of the Middle Ages'' pp. 91–92</ref>

From the early 12th century, French builders developed the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] style, marked by the use of [[rib vault]]s, [[Ogive|pointed arches]], [[flying buttress]]es, and large [[stained glass]] windows. It was used mainly in churches and cathedrals and continued in use until the 16th century in much of Europe. Classic examples of Gothic architecture include [[Chartres Cathedral]] and [[Reims Cathedral]] in France as well as [[Salisbury Cathedral]] in England.<ref name=Adams195>Adams ''History of Western Art'' pp. 195–216</ref> Stained glass became a crucial element in the design of churches, which continued to use extensive wall-paintings, now almost all lost.<ref name=Benton185to271>Benton ''Art of the Middle Ages'' pp. 185–190, 269–271</ref>

During this period the practice of manuscript illumination gradually passed from monasteries to lay workshops, so that according to [[Janetta Benton]] "by 1300 most monks bought their books in shops",<ref name=Benton250>Benton ''Art of the Middle Ages'' p. 250</ref> and the [[book of hours]] developed as a form of devotional book for lay-people.

===Famine and plague===
{{main|Crisis of the Late Middle Ages}}

Average annual temperature was declining from around 1200, introducing the gradual transition from the Medieval Warm Period to the [[Little Ice Age]]. Climate anomalies caused agricultural crises and famine, culminating in the [[Great Famine of 1315–1317|Great Famine of 1315–17]].<ref>Hoffmann ''An Environmental History of Medieval Europe'' pp. 323–325</ref> As the starving peasants slaughtered their draft animals, those who survived had to make extraordinary efforts to revive farming.

These troubles were followed in 1347 by the [[Black Death]], a [[pandemic]] that spread throughout Europe during the following three years, killing about one-third of the population. Towns were especially hard-hit because of their crowded conditions.{{efn-ua|One town, [[Lübeck]] in Germany, lost 90&nbsp;per cent of its population to the Black Death.<ref name=Singman_189>Singman ''Daily Life'' p. 189</ref>}} The rapid and extremely high mortality destroyed economy and trade, and the recovery was slow. The peasants who survived the pandemic paid lower rents to the landlords but demand for agricultural products declined, and the lower prices barely covered their costs. Urban workers received higher salaries but they were heavily taxed. Occasionally, the governments tried to fix rural rents at a high level, or to keep urban salaries low, which provoked [[Popular revolt in late-medieval Europe|popular uprisings]] across Europe, including the {{lang|fr|[[Jacquerie]]}} in France, the [[Peasants' Revolt]] in England, and the [[Ciompi Revolt]] in [[Florence]].<ref>Backman ''Worlds of Medieval Europe'' pp. 531–542</ref> The trauma of the plague led to an increased piety throughout Europe, manifested by the foundation of new charities, the self-mortification of the [[flagellant]]s, and the [[Black Death Jewish persecutions|scapegoating of Jews]].<ref name=Davies412>Davies ''Europe'' pp. 412–413</ref> Plague continued to strike Europe periodically during the rest of the Middle Ages.<ref name=Singman_189/>

Partly at the urging of landlords, governments attempted to legislate a return to the economic conditions that existed before the Black Death.<ref name=Keen234>Keen ''Pelican History of Medieval Europe'' pp. 234–237</ref> Non-clergy became increasingly literate, and urban populations began to imitate the nobility's interest in chivalry.<ref name=Vale346>Vale "Civilization of Courts and Cities" ''Oxford Illustrated History of Medieval Europe'' pp. 346–349</ref>

===State resurgence===

Strong, royalty-based [[nation state]]s rose throughout Europe in the Late Middle Ages, particularly in [[Kingdom of England|England]], [[Kingdom of France|France]], and the Christian kingdoms of the Iberian Peninsula: [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]], [[Crown of Castile|Castile]], and [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]]. The long conflicts of the period strengthened royal control over their kingdoms and were extremely hard on the peasantry. Kings profited from warfare that extended royal legislation and increased the lands they directly controlled.<ref name=Watts201>Watts ''Making of Polities'' pp. 201–219</ref> Paying for the wars required that methods of taxation become more effective and efficient, and the rate of taxation often increased.<ref name=Watts224>Watts ''Making of Polities'' pp. 224–233</ref> The requirement to obtain the consent of taxpayers allowed representative bodies such as the [[Parliament of England|English Parliament]] and the [[Estates General (France)|French Estates General]] to gain power and authority.<ref name=Watts233>Watts ''Making of Polities'' pp. 233–238</ref>

[[File:Joan of Arc miniature graded.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|[[Joan of Arc]], 15th- or 19th-century depiction]]
Throughout the 14th century, French kings sought to expand their influence at the expense of the territorial holdings of the nobility.<ref name=Watts166>Watts ''Making of Polities'' p. 166</ref> They ran into difficulties when attempting to confiscate the holdings of the English kings in southern France, leading to the [[Hundred Years' War]],<ref name=Watts169>Watts ''Making of Polities'' p. 169</ref> waged from 1337 to 1453.<ref name=MA100>Loyn "Hundred Years' War" ''Middle Ages'' p. 176</ref> Early in the war, the English won the battles of [[Battle of Crécy|Crécy]] and [[Battle of Poitiers|Poitiers]], captured the city of [[Calais]], and won control of much of France.{{efn-ua|Calais remained in English hands until 1558.<ref name=Davies545>Davies ''Europe'' p. 545</ref>}} The resulting stresses almost caused the disintegration of the French kingdom.<ref name=Watts180>Watts ''Making of Polities'' pp. 180–181</ref> In the early 15th century, France again came close to dissolving, after [[Henry V of England|Henry V's]] victory at the [[Battle of Agincourt]] in 1415, which briefly paved the way for a unification of the two kingdoms. However, his son [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]] soon squandered all previous gains,<ref>Allmand (1998), p. 458; Koenigsberger, p. 309.</ref> and in the late 1420s, the military successes of [[Joan of Arc]] (d. 1431) led to the victory of the French and the capture of the last English possessions in southern France in 1453.<ref name=Watts317>Watts ''Making of Polities'' pp. 317–322</ref> The price was high, with the population of France at the end of the wars likely half what it had been at the start. Conversely, the Wars had a positive effect on [[English national identity]], doing much to fuse the various local identities into a national English ideal. The conflict with France also helped create a national culture in England separate from French culture, which had previously been the dominant influence.<ref name=Davies423>Davies ''Europe'' p. 423</ref> The dominance of the English [[longbow]] began during early stages of the Hundred Years' War,<ref name=Nicholle186>Nicolle ''Medieval Warfare Source Book: Warfare in Western Christendom'' p. 186</ref> and [[cannon]] appeared on the battlefield at Crécy in 1346.<ref name=Nicolle296>Nicolle ''Medieval Warfare Source Book: Warfare in Western Christendom'' pp. 296–298</ref>

In modern-day Germany, the [[Holy Roman Empire]] continued to rule, but the elective nature of the imperial crown meant there was no enduring dynasty around which a strong state could form.<ref name=Watts170>Watts ''Making of Polities'' pp. 170–171</ref> Further east, the kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Poland (1385–1569)|Poland]], [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]], and [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemia]] grew powerful.<ref name=Watts173-75>Watts ''Making of Polities'' pp. 173–175</ref> In Iberia, the Christian kingdoms continued to gain land from the Muslim kingdoms of the peninsula;<ref name=Watts173>Watts ''Making of Polities'' p. 173</ref> Portugal concentrated on expanding overseas during the 15th century, while the other kingdoms were riven by difficulties over royal succession and other concerns.<ref name=Watts327>Watts ''Making of Polities'' pp. 327–332</ref><ref name=Watts340>Watts ''Making of Polities'' p. 340</ref> After losing the Hundred Years' War, England went on to suffer a long civil war known as the [[Wars of the Roses]], which lasted into the 1490s<ref name=Watts340/> and only ended when [[Henry VII of England|Henry Tudor]] (r. 1485–1509 as Henry VII) became king and consolidated power with his victory over [[Richard III of England|Richard III]] (r. 1483–85) at [[Battle of Bosworth Field|Bosworth]] in 1485.<ref name=Davies426>Davies ''Europe'' pp. 425–426</ref> In Scandinavia, [[Margaret I of Denmark]] (r. in Denmark 1387–1412) consolidated Norway, Denmark, and Sweden in the [[Kalmar Union|Union of Kalmar]], which continued until 1523.

===Collapse of Byzantium and rise of the Ottomans===

[[File:1396-Battle of Nicopolis.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Horsemen and infantry fighting at a fortress on a river|[[Battle of Nicopolis]] depicted in the late-16th-century Ottoman illuminated chronicle {{lang|tr|Hunernama}}]]

Although the [[Palaiologos]] emperors recaptured Constantinople from the Western Europeans in 1261, they were never able to regain control of much of the former imperial lands. The former Byzantine lands in the Balkans were divided between the new [[Kingdom of Serbia (medieval)|Kingdom of Serbia]], the [[Second Bulgarian Empire]] and the city-state of [[Republic of Venice|Venice]]. The power of the Byzantine emperors was threatened by a new Turkish tribe, the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]], who established themselves in Anatolia in the 13th century and [[Byzantine–Ottoman Wars|steadily expanded]] throughout the 14th century. The Ottomans expanded into Europe, reducing Bulgaria to a vassal state by 1366 and taking over Serbia after its defeat at the [[Battle of Kosovo]] in 1389. Western Europeans rallied to the plight of the Christians in the Balkans and declared a new crusade in 1396; a great army was sent to the Balkans, where it was defeated at the [[Battle of Nicopolis]].<ref name=Davies385>Davies ''Europe'' pp. 385–389</ref> Constantinople was finally [[Fall of Constantinople|captured]] by the Ottomans in 1453.<ref name=Davies446>Davies ''Europe'' p. 446</ref>

===Controversy within the Church===
{{Main|Western Schism|Bohemian Reformation|Hussites}}
During the tumultuous 14th century, disputes within the leadership of the Church led to the [[Avignon Papacy]] of 1309–76,<ref name=Thomson170>Thomson ''Western Church'' pp. 170–171</ref> also called the "Babylonian Captivity of the Papacy" (a reference to the [[Babylonian captivity]] of the Jews),<ref name=MAAvignon>Loyn "Avignon" ''Middle Ages'' p. 45</ref> and then to the [[Western Schism|Great Schism]], lasting from 1378 to 1418, when there were two and later three rival popes, each supported by several states.<ref name= MAGreat>Loyn "Great Schism" ''Middle Ages'' p. 153</ref> Ecclesiastical officials convened at the [[Council of Constance]] in 1414, and in the following year, the council deposed one of the rival popes, leaving only two claimants. Further depositions followed, and in November 1417, the council elected [[Pope Martin V|Martin V]] (pope 1417–31) as pope.<ref name=Thomson184>Thomson ''Western Church'' pp. 184–187</ref>

Besides the schism, the Western Church was riven by theological controversies, some of which turned into heresies. [[John Wycliffe]] (d. 1384), an English theologian, was condemned as a heretic in 1415 for teaching that the laity should have access to the text of the Bible as well as for holding views on the [[Eucharist]] that were contrary to Church doctrine.<ref name=Thomson197>Thomson ''Western Church'' pp. 197–199</ref> Wycliffe's teachings influenced two of the major heretical movements of the later Middle Ages: [[Lollardy]] in England and [[Hussites|Hussitism]] in Bohemia.<ref name=Thomson218>Thomson ''Western Church'' p. 218</ref> The Bohemian movement initiated with the teaching of [[Jan Hus]], who was burned at the stake in 1415. The Hussite Church, although the target of a crusade, survived beyond the Middle Ages.<ref name=Thomson213>Thomson ''Western Church'' pp. 213–217</ref> Other heresies were manufactured, such as the accusations against the Knights Templar that resulted in their suppression in 1312 and the division of their great wealth between the French king [[Philip IV of France|Philip IV]] (r. 1285–1314) and the Hospitallers.<ref name=Templars>Loyn "Knights of the Temple (Templars)" ''Middle Ages'' pp. 201–202</ref>

The papacy further refined the practice in the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] in the Late Middle Ages, holding that the clergy alone was allowed to partake of the wine in the Eucharist. This further distanced the secular laity from the clergy. The laity continued the practices of pilgrimages, veneration of relics, and belief in the power of the devil. Mystics such as [[Meister Eckhart]] (d. 1327) and [[Thomas à Kempis]] (d. 1471) wrote works that taught the laity to focus on their inner spiritual life, which laid the groundwork for the Protestant Reformation. Besides mysticism, belief in witches and witchcraft became widespread, and by the late 15th century, the Church had begun to lend credence to populist fears of witchcraft.<ref name=Davies436>Davies ''Europe'' pp. 436–437</ref>

===Scholars, intellectuals, and exploration===
{{see also|Europeans in Medieval China}}
During the Later Middle Ages, theologians such as [[Duns Scotus|John Duns Scotus]] (d. 1308) and [[William of Ockham]] (d. {{Circa|1348}})<ref name=MASchol>Loyn "Scholasticism" ''Middle Ages'' pp. 293–294</ref> led a reaction against intellectualist scholasticism, objecting to the application of reason to faith. Their efforts undermined the prevailing [[Platonic idealism|Platonic]] idea of universals. Ockham's insistence that reason operates independently of faith allowed science to be separated from theology and philosophy.<ref name=Davies433>Davies ''Europe'' pp. 433–434</ref> Legal studies were marked by the steady advance of Roman law into areas of jurisprudence previously governed by [[Custom (law)|customary law]]. The lone exception to this trend was in England, where the [[common law]] remained pre-eminent. Other countries codified their laws; legal codes were promulgated in Castile, Poland, and [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania|Lithuania]].<ref name=Davies438>Davies ''Europe'' pp. 438–439</ref>

[[File:Studying astronomy and geometry.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|Clerics studying [[astronomy]] and [[geometry]], French, early 15th century]]

Education remained mostly focused on the training of future clergy. The basic learning of the letters and numbers remained the province of the family or a village priest, but the secondary subjects of the [[trivium]]—grammar, rhetoric, logic—were studied in cathedral schools or in schools provided by cities. Universities spread throughout Europe in the 14th and 15th centuries. Lay literacy rates rose, but were still low; one estimate gave a literacy rate of ten per cent of males and one per cent of females in 1500.<ref name=Singman224>Singman ''Daily Life'' p. 224</ref>

The publication of vernacular literature increased, with [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]] (d. 1321), Petrarch and Boccaccio in 14th-century Italy, [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] (d. 1400) and [[William Langland]] (d. {{Circa|1386}}) in England, and [[François Villon]] (d. 1464) and [[Christine de Pizan]] (d. {{Circa|1430}}) in France. Much literature remained religious in character, and although a great deal of it continued to be written in Latin, a new demand developed for saints' lives and other devotional tracts in the vernacular languages.<ref name=Davies438/> This was fed by the growth of the ''[[Devotio Moderna]]'' movement, most prominently in the formation of the [[Brethren of the Common Life]].<ref name=Keen282>Keen ''Pelican History of Medieval Europe'' pp. 282–283</ref> Theatre also developed in the guise of [[Mystery play|miracle plays]] put on by the Church.<ref name=Davies438/> At the end of the period, the development of the [[printing press]] in about 1450 led to the establishment of publishing houses throughout Europe by 1500.<ref name=Davies445>Davies ''Europe'' p. 445</ref>

In the early 15th century, the countries of the Iberian Peninsula began to sponsor exploration beyond the boundaries of Europe. Prince [[Henry the Navigator]] of Portugal (d. 1460) sent expeditions that discovered the [[Canary Islands]], the [[Azores]], and [[Cape Verde]] during his lifetime. After his death, exploration continued; [[Bartolomeu Dias]] (d. 1500) went around the [[Cape of Good Hope]] in 1486, and [[Vasco da Gama]] (d. 1524) sailed around Africa to India in 1498.<ref name=Davies451>Davies ''Europe'' p. 451</ref> The combined Spanish monarchies of Castile and Aragon sponsored the voyage of exploration by Christopher Columbus (d. 1506) in 1492 that led to his discovery of the Americas.<ref name=Davies454>Davies ''Europe'' pp. 454–455</ref> The English crown under [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] sponsored the voyage of [[John Cabot]] (d. 1498) in 1497, which landed on [[Cape Breton Island]].<ref name=Davies511>Davies ''Europe'' p. 511</ref>

{{anchor|Agriculture}}

===Technological and military developments===
[[File:Crescenzi calendar.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|[[Labours of the Months]], agricultural calendar {{Circa|1470}}, from a manuscript of [[Pietro de Crescenzi]]'s manual on farming]]

One of the major developments in the military sphere during the Late Middle Ages was the increased use of infantry and light cavalry.<ref name=NicolleWestern180>Nicolle ''Medieval Warfare Source Book: Warfare in Western Christendom'' p. 180</ref> The English also employed longbowmen, but other countries were unable to create similar forces with the same success.<ref name=NicolleWestern183>Nicolle ''Medieval Warfare Source Book: Warfare in Western Christendom'' p. 183</ref> Armour continued to advance, spurred by the increasing power of crossbows, and [[plate armour]] was developed to protect soldiers from crossbows as well as the handheld guns that were developed.<ref name=NicolleWestern188>Nicolle ''Medieval Warfare Source Book: Warfare in Western Christendom'' p. 188</ref> [[Pole weapon|Pole arms]] reached new prominence with the development of the Flemish and Swiss infantry armed with pikes and other long spears.<ref name=Nicolle185>Nicolle ''Medieval Warfare Source Book: Warfare in Western Christendom'' p. 185</ref>

In agriculture, the increased usage of sheep with long-fibred wool allowed a stronger thread to be spun. In addition, the [[spinning wheel]] replaced the traditional [[distaff]], tripling production.<ref name=Epstein193>Epstein ''Economic and Social History'' pp. 193–194</ref>{{efn-ua|This wheel was still simple, as it did not yet incorporate a treadle-wheel to twist and pull the fibres. That refinement was not invented until the 15th century.<ref name=Daily36>Singman ''Daily Life'' p. 36</ref>}} A less technological refinement that still greatly affected daily life was the use of buttons as closures for garments.<ref name=Daily38>Singman ''Daily Life'' p. 38</ref> Windmills were refined with the creation of the [[tower mill]], allowing the upper part of the windmill to be spun around to face the direction from which the wind was blowing.<ref name=Epstein200>Epstein ''Economic and Social History'' pp. 200–201</ref> The [[blast furnace]] appeared around 1350 in Sweden, increasing the quantity of iron produced and improving its quality.<ref name=Epstein203>Epstein ''Economic and Social History'' pp. 203–204</ref> The first [[Patent|patent law]] in 1447 in Venice protected the rights of inventors to their inventions.<ref name=Epstein213>Epstein ''Economic and Social History'' p. 213</ref>

===Late medieval art and architecture===
[[File:Les Très Riches Heures du duc de Berry février.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|February scene from the [[Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry]], 1410s]]

The Late Middle Ages in Europe as a whole correspond to the [[Trecento]] and [[Early Renaissance]] cultural periods in Italy. Northern Europe and Spain continued to use Gothic styles, which became increasingly elaborate in the 15th century, until almost the end of the period. [[International Gothic]] was a courtly style that reached much of Europe in the decades around 1400, producing masterpieces such as the [[Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry]].<ref name=Benton253>Benton ''Art of the Middle Ages'' pp. 253–256</ref> All over Europe, secular art continued to increase in quantity and quality, and in the 15th century, the mercantile classes of Italy and Flanders became important patrons, commissioning small portraits as well as a growing range of luxury items such as jewellery, [[Casket with Scenes of Romances (Walters 71264)|ivory caskets]], [[cassone]] chests, and [[maiolica]] pottery. Although royalty owned huge collections of plate, little survives except for the [[Royal Gold Cup]].<ref>Lightbown ''Secular Goldsmiths' Work'' p. 78</ref> Italian silk manufacture developed, so that Western churches and elites no longer needed to rely on imports from Byzantium or the Islamic world. In France and Flanders [[tapestry]] weaving of sets like ''[[The Lady and the Unicorn]]'' became a major luxury industry.<ref name=Benton257>Benton ''Art of the Middle Ages'' pp. 257–262</ref>

The large external sculptural schemes of Early Gothic churches gave way to more sculpture inside the building, as tombs became more elaborate and other features such as pulpits were sometimes lavishly carved, as in the [[Pulpit of Sant' Andrea, Pistoia (Giovanni Pisano)|Pulpit by Giovanni Pisano in Sant'Andrea]]. Painted or carved wooden relief [[altarpiece]]s became common, especially as churches created many [[Chapel|side-chapels]]. [[Early Netherlandish painting]]s by artists such as [[Jan van Eyck]] (d. 1441) and [[Rogier van der Weyden]] (d. 1464) rivalled that of Italy, as did northern illuminated manuscripts, which in the 15th century began to be collected on a large scale by secular elites, who also commissioned secular books, especially histories. From about 1450, printed books rapidly became popular, though still expensive. There were around 30,000 different editions of [[Incunable|incunabula]], or works printed before 1500,<ref name=BL>British Library Staff "[http://www.bl.uk/catalogues/istc/index.html Incunabula Short Title Catalogue]" ''British Library''</ref> by which time illuminated manuscripts were commissioned only by royalty and a few others. Very small [[woodcut]]s, nearly all religious, were affordable even by peasants in parts of Northern Europe from the middle of the 15th century. More expensive [[engraving]]s supplied a wealthier market with a variety of images.<ref name=Griffiths17>Griffiths ''Prints and Printmaking'' pp. 17–18, 39–46</ref>

==Modern perceptions==
{{see also| Dark Ages (historiography)|Medievalism|Medieval studies|Middle Ages in popular culture}}

[[File:Gossuin de Metz - L'image du monde - BNF Fr. 574 fo42.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.1|Medieval illustration of the [[spherical Earth]], in a 14th-century copy of ''[[Gautier de Metz|L'Image du monde]]'']]

The medieval period is frequently caricatured as a "time of ignorance and superstition" that placed "the word of religious authorities over personal experience and rational activity."<ref>Lindberg "Medieval Church Encounters" ''When Science & Christianity Meet'' p. 8</ref> This is a legacy from both the [[Renaissance]] and [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] when scholars favourably contrasted their intellectual cultures with those of the medieval period. Renaissance scholars saw the Middle Ages as a period of decline from the high culture and civilisation of the Classical world. Enlightenment scholars saw reason as superior to faith, and thus viewed the Middle Ages as a time of ignorance and superstition.<ref name=Davies291>Davies ''Europe'' pp. 291–293</ref>

Others argue that reason was generally held in high regard during the Middle Ages. Science historian [[Edward Grant]] writes, "If revolutionary rational thoughts were expressed [in the 18th century]<!--original quotation says: "expressed in the Age of Reason"-->, they were only made possible because of the long medieval tradition that established the use of reason as one of the most important of human activities".<ref name=Grant9>Grant ''God and Reason'' p. 9</ref> Also, contrary to common belief, [[David C. Lindberg|David Lindberg]] writes, "The late medieval scholar rarely experienced the coercive power of the Church and would have regarded himself as free (particularly in the natural sciences) to follow reason and observation wherever they led."<ref name=QPeters>Quoted in Peters "Science and Religion" ''Encyclopedia of Religion'' p. 8182</ref>

The caricature of the period is also reflected in some more specific notions. One misconception, first propagated in the 19th century,<ref name=flat>Russell ''Inventing the Flat Earth'' pp. 49–58</ref> is that all people in the Middle Ages believed that the [[Myth of the flat Earth|Earth was flat]].<ref name=flat/> This is untrue, as lecturers in the medieval universities commonly argued that evidence showed the Earth was a sphere.<ref>Grant ''Planets, Stars, & Orbs'' pp. 626–630</ref> Other misconceptions such as "the Church prohibited autopsies and dissections during the Middle Ages", "the rise of Christianity killed off ancient science", or "the medieval Christian Church suppressed the growth of natural philosophy", are all cited by Numbers as examples of widely popular myths that still pass as historical truth, although they are not supported by historical research.<ref name=Numberslect>Numbers "[https://web.archive.org/web/20171011022345/https://www.faraday.st-edmunds.cam.ac.uk/CIS/Numbers/Numbers_Lecture.pdf Myths and Truths in Science and Religion: A historical perspective]" ''Lecture archive'' Archived 11 October 2017</ref>{{dubious|source is self-published tract whitewashing religion|date=August 2023}}
