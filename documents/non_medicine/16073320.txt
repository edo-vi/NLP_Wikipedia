'''Thumps''' is a condition that occurs in [[horse]]s where there is an irregular spasming of the [[Thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]],<ref name=LaMarra>{{cite web|last1=LaMarra|first1=Tom|title=Top Filly Princess of Sylmar Retired|url=http://www.bloodhorse.com/horse-racing/articles/87482/top-filly-princess-of-sylmar-retired|website=Blood-Horse|accessdate=6 November 2014|date=September 19, 2014}}</ref> usually caused by dehydration due to fluid loss and related abnormal [[electrolyte imbalance|electrolyte levels]], most often [[blood calcium]]. It is essentially a case of the [[hiccup]]s, but in horses it usually has a more serious underlying cause than in the corresponding human condition.

It is most often seen in horses used for [[endurance riding]] but also occurs in other equine athletes. Clinical signs include sound coming from the horse's abdomen, which also can be seen contracting with the animal's heartbeat, but at rates of 40-50 times per minute. The condition was first identified by a veterinarian in 1831.<ref name=TheHorse>{{cite web|author1=University of Illinois College of Agriculture|title=Equine 'Thumps' Are More than Mere Hiccups|url=http://www.thehorse.com/articles/21687/equine-thumps-are-more-than-mere-hiccups|website=The Horse|accessdate=6 November 2014|date=August 5, 2008}}</ref>
