'''''Gasterophilus haemorrhoidalis''''' (also called '''nose botfly''' or '''lip botfly''') is a [[species]] of the [[genus]] ''[[Gasterophilus]]'' that lays eggs on the lips and around the mouth of [[horse]]s, [[mule]]s and [[donkey]]s. Their hatching is simulated by moisture from licking or feeding of hosts. 

First instar development: Penetrate epidermis of the lips of hosts and migrate into mouth.

Second instar: move to stomach and duodenum(first section of small intestine)

Third instar: larvae become detached after some time and then pass to the rectum and re-attach themselves.


Appearance: Postsutural scutum with ground color uniformly brown or black legs yellowish brown, with femora distinctly darkened; abdomen ground color dark brown or black, with reddish-yellow or orangish setae posteriorly  male with surstylus abruptly tapered distally, surstylar setae short, reaching at most halfway to the sagittal plane 


Egg Description: Pedicel long and slender, with width/length ratio around 1/6 in lateral view, accounting for 2/5 of the total egg length. 

In [[Equidae]], third-stage larvae attach to the stomach, but also to the rectum, sometimes in great numbers.<ref>Johannes Kaufmann, Parasitic Infections of Domestic Animals, Birkh√§user Verlag, Basel, Boston, Berlin, 1996, {{ISBN|3-7643-5115-2}}.</ref> Heavy infestation can cause anal [[prolapse]] in foals and mules.

They do not [[parasitise]] humans.
