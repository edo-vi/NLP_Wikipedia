'''beoutQ''' was a [[Pirate decryption|pirate]] [[pay television]] broadcaster that operated in [[Saudi Arabia]] between August 2017 and August 2019. The service  consisted of ten [[satellite television]] channels that carried rebranded feeds of programming from [[Qatar|Qatari]] broadcaster [[BeIN Sports (Middle East TV network)|beIN Sports]]. beoutQ began operations after Saudi Arabia blocked [[beIN Media Group]] from offering its services in the country; the action stemmed from a then-ongoing [[Qatar diplomatic crisis|diplomatic crisis]] between Qatar and other Arab countries over its [[Qatar and state-sponsored terrorism|alleged state sponsorship of terrorist groups]]. The service operated out of facilities in Saudi Arabia, and utilised the [[Arabsat]] satellites for transmission. The channels also carried propaganda accusing beIN Sports of being a [[monopoly]].  

The service was condemned by beIN Media Group, sports bodies, and governments for its large-scale [[Copyright infringement|infringement of copyrights]]; beIN Sports's managing director described beoutQ as being an industrial-scale operation, and warned that the service was creating market conditions that would make them less likely to make larger investments in sports broadcast rights. Citing alleged inaction against the service, Saudi Arabia was placed on intellectual property watchlists by the [[United States Trade Representative]] and European Union. In turn, the Saudi government accused beIN Sports of engaging in [[anti-competitive]] behaviour and of participating in a [[smear campaign]] against the Kingdom with its sister company [[Al Jazeera]].      

Citing the impact of the service, beIN declined to renew its rights to [[Formula One]] and the [[Bundesliga]] in the [[MENA]] region. It also criticised football bodies for hosting [[Super cup|super cups]] in Saudi Arabia. In June 2020, beIN Sports briefly pulled the [[Serie A]] from its channels worldwide until it was compensated for the impact of piracy on its rights. Issues surrounding beoutQ also impacted a bid by the Saudi [[Public Investment Fund]] to acquire [[Premier League]] club [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]]. In September 2021, a representative of the club accused beIN of engaging in lobbying efforts against the sale that improperly influenced the Premier League. 

In August 2019, beoutQ abruptly ceased operations on satellite. Its [[set-top boxes]] continued to be usable via third-party [[IPTV]] services available on a built-in [[app store]]. In June 2020, the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) issued a report finding evidence that the service operated out of Saudi Arabia. The WTO also found that Saudi Arabia had frustrated beIN's ability to receive [[legal counsel]] in the country. In October 2021, after the diplomatic crisis was resolved, beIN Media Group stated that Saudi Arabia was planning to lift its ban on the beIN Sports service, ahead of the Premier League officially approving the Saudi purchase of Newcastle United.

== Background ==
The Qatar-based [[BeIN Sports (Middle East TV network)|beIN Sports]] is the dominant broadcaster of sports programming in the Middle East and North Africa ([[MENA]]). It had held rights to prominent events such as the [[Olympic Games]], the [[FIFA World Cup]], [[UEFA Champions League]], [[Asian Football Confederation]] (including the [[AFC Asian Cup]]), [[La Liga]], and [[Premier League]] in association football, [[Formula One]] racing, international [[tennis]] events, and other events.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www2.gulf-times.com/story/603496/Premier-League-gets-tough-with-Saudi-piracy |title=Premier League gets tough with Saudi piracy |date=21 August 2018 |work=Gulf-Times |access-date=26 August 2018 |archive-date=26 August 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200826051542/https://gulf-times.com/story/603496/Premier-League-gets-tough-with-Saudi-piracy |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=":1">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/16/sports/qatar-saudi-arabia-beoutq-bein-sports.html |title=Qatar's BeIN Sports Says It Has Proof of Saudi Role in Piracy Dispute |work=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=26 August 2018 |archive-date=1 August 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200801051218/https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/16/sports/qatar-saudi-arabia-beoutq-bein-sports.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

In June 2017, as part of [[Qatar diplomatic crisis|a diplomatic crisis]] over alleged funding of extremist groups by the government of Qatar, beIN was banned from selling its subscriptions in Saudi Arabia, and the beIN Sports channels were briefly banned in the [[United Arab Emirates]] (the ban was reversed the following month).<ref>{{cite news |url=https://money.cnn.com/2017/06/08/media/uae-qatar-media-blocked/index.html |title=Blocked in Dubai: Qatar cartoon and soccer channels |first=Zahraa |last=Alkhalisi |date=8 June 2017 |publisher=[[CNN]] |accessdate=13 August 2017 |archive-date=21 June 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190621205631/https://money.cnn.com/2017/06/08/media/uae-qatar-media-blocked/index.html |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/07/uae-restores-qatar-bein-sports-network-air-170722144955060.html |title=UAE restores Qatar's BeIN sports network on air |date=23 July 2017 |agency=[[Al Jazeera]] |accessdate=13 August 2017 |archive-date=21 June 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190621205637/https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/07/uae-restores-qatar-bein-sports-network-air-170722144955060.html |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.thenational.ae/uae/bein-sports-back-on-tv-in-the-uae-1.613012 |title=BeIN Sports back on TV in the UAE |first1=Steven |last1=McCombe |first2=Roberta |last2=Pennington |date=22 July 2017 |work=[[The National (Abu Dhabi)|The National]] |accessdate=13 August 2017 |archive-date=6 July 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190706022638/https://www.thenational.ae/uae/bein-sports-back-on-tv-in-the-uae-1.613012 |url-status=live }}</ref> It was reported that Saudi Arabia planned to fund a new competitor out of [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]], known as PBS Sport,<ref>{{cite web |title=Saudi-Egyptian sports alliance to replace blocked Qatari beIN Sports |url=https://www.arabnews.com/node/1117646/media |date=20 June 2017 |website=Arab News |access-date=4 May 2020 |archive-date=22 March 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200322103553/https://www.arabnews.com/node/1117646/media |url-status=live }}</ref> but the proposed service never launched.<ref name=":10">{{cite web |title=Newcastle takeover could lead to Saudi bid for Premier League rights, says report |url=https://www.sportspromedia.com/news/newcastle-takeover-premier-league-tv-rights-saudi-arabia |website=SportsPro Media |date=29 April 2020 |access-date=4 May 2020}}</ref>

A few months later, a new subscription service known as beoutQ emerged, which [[Pirate decryption|repackaged the beIN Sports channels as their own]]. Initially, the service was distributed online, but later began to be distributed via 10 [[Satellite television|satellite]] channels.<ref name=":5">{{cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/could-be-worlds-biggest-state-sponsored-piracy-operation-1217919 |title=Could This Be the World's Biggest State-Sponsored Piracy Operation? |website=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=20 June 2019 |access-date=21 June 2019 |archive-date=21 June 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190621205623/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/could-be-worlds-biggest-state-sponsored-piracy-operation-1217919 |url-status=live }}</ref> The service's launch was backed by a social media campaign on [[Twitter]]; [[Saud al-Qahtani]], former adviser to [[King of Saudi Arabia|King]] [[Abdullah of Saudi Arabia|Abdullah]], participated in the campaign.<ref name=":5" /> It was reported that the service's associated decoder boxes and subscriptions had become widely available across the country,<ref name=":0">{{cite news |url=http://www.sportspromedia.com/analysis/world-cup-broadcasting-pirates-saudi-arabias-bein-sport-qatar |title=World Cup pirates: Saudi Arabia's BeIN action threatens future of international sports broadcasting |work=SportsPro |access-date=26 August 2018 |archive-date=26 August 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180826150102/http://www.sportspromedia.com/analysis/world-cup-broadcasting-pirates-saudi-arabias-bein-sport-qatar |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=":2">{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/aug/21/premier-league-games-screened-illegally-via-saudi-satellite-firm |title=Premier League games 'screened illegally via Saudi satellite firm' |last=Wintour |first=Patrick |date=21 August 2018 |website=[[The Guardian]] |access-date=26 August 2018 |archive-date=21 June 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190621205622/https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/aug/21/premier-league-games-screened-illegally-via-saudi-satellite-firm |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.sportspromedia.com/news/premier-league-piracy-beoutq-bein-saudi-arabia-qatar-ligue-1 |title=BeoutQ illegally shows opening Premier League and Ligue 1 games |work=SportsPro |access-date=26 August 2018 |archive-date=26 August 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180826151607/http://www.sportspromedia.com/news/premier-league-piracy-beoutq-bein-saudi-arabia-qatar-ligue-1 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=":3">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/09/sports/bein-sports-qatar-beoutq.html |title=The Brazen Bootlegging of a Multibillion-Dollar Sports Network |first=Tariq |last=Panja |work=The New York Times |date=9 May 2018 |access-date=22 June 2019 |archive-date=1 August 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200801051212/https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/09/sports/bein-sports-qatar-beoutq.html |url-status=live }}</ref> bundled with a free one-year subscription.<ref name=":5" />

During commercial breaks, the channels broadcast propaganda attacking Qatar and beIN; one such example included a cartoon short where a beIN Sports executive (depicted as a cigar-smoking businessman surrounded by piles of money) realises that beoutQ was stealing away his customers. He attempts to meet representatives of FIFA (including a cartoon portrayal of its president [[Gianni Infantino]]), [[UEFA]], and the [[Premier League]], but they all ignore him. When he gets home, he discovers that his children were also watching beoutQ. The short ended with a caption reading "No to monopoly, no to politicising sport".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sportspromedia.com/opinion/saudi-arabia-beoutq-bein-sports-piracy-tv-rights |title=Saudi Arabia, cartoon pirates and the great TV sports rights robbery |website=SportsPro Media |date=20 March 2019 |access-date=21 June 2019 |archive-date=21 June 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190621203210/http://www.sportspromedia.com/opinion/saudi-arabia-beoutq-bein-sports-piracy-tv-rights |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=":3" />

Arabsat regularly denied that it was involved in beoutQ.<ref name=":2" /><ref name=":0" /><ref name=":3" /> A French court commissioned an independent test that had also traced the signals to Arabsat. It was observed that beoutQ's satellite frequencies changed frequently during the test, likely to evade detection.<ref name=":7" />

== Technical details ==
In 2019, [[MarkMonitor]] performed an investigation into beoutQ's hardware and software at the request of FIFA, UEFA, and major European football leagues.<ref name=":23" /> The beoutQ service was transmitted via [[ArabSat|Arabsat]]'s [[Badr-4]], Badr-5, and Badr-6 satellites,<ref name=":18" /> and was received using [[Android (operating system)|Android]]-based [[Digital media player|"hybrid" set-top boxes]] manufactured by the Chinese company DreamMax. Their firmware contained several levels of [[geolocation]] checks in order to prevent the boxes from being activated outside of Saudi Arabia, including [[over-the-air programming]] during its first-time setup that required access to beoutQ's satellite signal.<ref name=":18" />

Alongside the beoutQ satellite channels, the boxes include a "beoutQ [[App store|App Store]]" with a selection of third-party media apps. Of the 25 apps listed at the time of the review, most of them were for other pirate [[video on demand]] and subscription IPTV services. Of the three IPTV services highlighted by the MarkMonitor investigation, all three of them carried the beIN Sports channels (with one of them listing them in their [[Electronic program guide|program guide]] under the "beoutQ" name, but using the unmodified feeds from beIN), and one was listed on its website as being based in the Saudi capital of [[Riyadh]].<ref name=":23">{{Cite web |last=Hawley |first=Steven |title=MarkMonitor research released by UEFA & European football leagues traces beoutQ piracy – Piracy Monitor |url=https://piracymonitor.org/european-football-leagues-trace-beoutq-piracy/ |access-date=17 August 2022 |website=PiracyMonitor |date=19 September 2019 |language=en-US |archive-date=17 August 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220817202522/https://piracymonitor.org/european-football-leagues-trace-beoutq-piracy/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=":18" /> The beoutQ App Store also contained apps for legitimate services such as [[HBO Go]], [[Red Bull TV]], [[SoundCloud]], [[Spotify]], [[TED (conference)|TED]], [[TuneIn|TuneIn Radio]], and [[YouTube]].<ref name=":18" />

In mid-August 2019, it was reported that beoutQ had shut down its satellite transmissions.

=== By beIN and Al Jazeera ===
The owner of beIN Sports, [[beIN Media Group]], condemned the beoutQ service. beIN Sports managing director Tom Keaveny described beoutQ as being an "industrial-scale" operation,<ref name=":8" /><ref name=":3" /><ref name=":6" />  and not just "a small outfit operating out of someone’s bedroom."<ref>{{Cite web |date=1 October 2018 |title='Industrial-scale piracy' is plaguing the World Cup due to a diplomatic crisis in the Middle East |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/tech/world-cup-live-streaming-channel-watch-online-stream-free-bein-piracy-beoutq-a8432916.html |access-date=18 August 2022 |website=The Independent |language=en |archive-date=18 August 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220818035503/https://www.independent.co.uk/tech/world-cup-live-streaming-channel-watch-online-stream-free-bein-piracy-beoutq-a8432916.html |url-status=live }}</ref>
