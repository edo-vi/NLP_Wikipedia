===Viral mechanism===
{{see also|Ebola virus disease#Virology}}
A significant part of the actual EVD infection is based on [[immune suppression]] along with systemic inflammation, leading to multiple organ failure and [[Shock (circulatory)|shock]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Feldmann |first1=Heinz |last2=Geisbert |first2=Thomas W. |title=Ebola haemorrhagic fever |journal=The Lancet |date=March 2011 |volume=377 |issue=9768 |pages=849–862 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(10)60667-8 |pmid=21084112 |pmc=3406178 }}</ref>  Systemic inflammation and fever may damage many types of tissues in the body but the consequences are especially profound in the liver where Ebola wipes out cells required to produce [[coagulation]]. In the gastrointestinal tract damaged cells lead to diarrhea putting patients at risk of dehydration. And in the [[adrenal gland]] the virus cripples the cells  that make steroids which regulate blood pressure, resulting in [[circulatory collapse]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Servick |first1=Kelly |title=What does Ebola actually do? |url=https://www.science.org/content/article/what-does-ebola-actually-do-rev2 |website=Science |access-date=20 February 2021}}</ref>

===Genetic epidemiology===
[[Genetic epidemiology]] is a medical field that studies how genetic factors and the environment interact, in this case the outbreak affecting the populations of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the neighboring country of Uganda.  Genetic sequencing had already identified another unrelated strain of [[Zaire ebolavirus]] that was implicated in [[2018 Équateur province Ebola outbreak|the 2018 outbreak in Équateur province]] which had ended only a week previously.  This was the first time two epidemiologically and genetically distinct outbreaks of Ebola had emerged within weeks of each other.<ref>{{cite web |title=Genetic Epidemiology |url=https://www.genome.gov/genetics-glossary/Genetic-Epidemiology |website=Genome.gov |access-date=4 February 2021 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ilunga Kalenga |first1=Oly |last2=Moeti |first2=Matshidiso |last3=Sparrow |first3=Annie |last4=Nguyen |first4=Vinh-Kim |last5=Lucey |first5=Daniel |last6=Ghebreyesus |first6=Tedros A. |title=The Ongoing Ebola Epidemic in the Democratic Republic of Congo, 2018–2019 |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |pages=373–383 |doi=10.1056/NEJMsr1904253 |date=25 July 2019|volume=381 |issue=4 |pmid=31141654 |doi-access=free }}</ref>  In 2020 a third outbreak of Zaire ebolavirus occurred in the DRC.

== Transmission ==
Ebola virus is found in a variety of bodily fluids, such as breast milk, saliva, stool, blood, and semen, rendering it highly contagious due to ease of contact. Although a few transmission methods are known, there is a possibility that many other methods are unknown and must be further researched. Here are some potential routes of transmission:<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Judson |first1=Seth |last2=Prescott |first2=Joseph |last3=Munster |first3=Vincent |title=Understanding Ebola Virus Transmission |journal=Viruses |date=3 February 2015 |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=511–521 |doi=10.3390/v7020511 |pmid=25654239 |pmc=4353901 |doi-access=free }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Transmission {{!}} Ebola Hemorrhagic Fever {{!}} CDC |url=https://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/transmission/index.html |website=www.cdc.gov |access-date=20 November 2019 |date=6 November 2019}}</ref>
* Droplets: Droplet transmission occurs when contact is made with virus-containing droplets.
* [[Fomites]]: Occurs when an individual comes in contact with a pathogen-containing surface.
* Bodily fluids: The most common way of transmitting the Ebola virus in humans is through contact with infected bodily fluids.

Those infected by EVD generally gain immunity, although it is considered possible that such immunity is only temporary.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=MacIntyre |first1=C.

==Containment and control==
Even with the advances made in vaccine technology and treatment options during previous Ebola outbreaks, effective control of the North Kivu Epidemic continued to rely on traditional public health efforts including the timely identification and isolation of cases, control measures in hospital settings, identification and follow-up of contacts, community engagement, and safe burials.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Inungu |first1=Joseph |last2=Iheduru-Anderson |first2=Kechi |last3=Odio |first3=Ossam J |title=Recurrent Ebolavirus disease in the Democratic Republic of Congo: update and challenges |journal=AIMS Public Health |date=20 November 2019 |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=502–513 |doi=10.3934/publichealth.2019.4.502 |pmid=31909070 |pmc=6940573 |issn=2327-8994|doi-access=free }}</ref> Data from the West African Ebola Outbreak showed that response strategies that achieved 60% efficacy for sanitary burial, case isolation, and contact-tracing combined, could have greatly reduced the daily number of Ebola cases and ended the outbreak after only 6 months.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Pandey|first1=A.|last2=Atkins|first2=K.

[[Contact tracing]] is defined as the identification and follow-up of persons who may have been in contact with a person infected with Ebola. Ideally, close contacts are observed for 21 days after their last known exposure to a case and isolated if they become symptomatic. The volume of contacts and the duration of monitoring presented challenges in Ebola surveillance as it required careful record-keeping by properly trained and equipped staff.<ref>{{Cite web|last=WHO, CDC|date=September 2015|title=Implementation and management of contact tracing for Ebola virus disease|url=https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/185258/WHO_EVD_Guidance_Contact_15.1_eng.pdf;jsessionid=36CB095B65A9ED753792803F0573FD12?sequence=1|access-date=16 December 2020|website=}}</ref> To strengthen surveillance activities, the DRC Ministry of Health began disseminating standardized Ebola case definitions, developed reporting tools, and communication strategies, and began distribution of daily situation reports.<ref name=aru/> Rapid response teams were deployed to affected health zones to strengthen Ebola case management and infection prevention and control in health care facilities and treatment centers.<ref name=aru /> Similar to the West African Ebola Outbreak, relatively few (less than 10%) Ebola cases presented with hemorrhagic symptoms.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=2020-03-01|title=The 2018/19 Ebola epidemic the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC): epidemiology, outbreak control, and conflict|journal=Infection Prevention in Practice|language=en|volume=2|issue=1|pages=100038|doi=10.1016/j.infpip.2020.100038|issn=2590-0889|doi-access=free|last1=Shears|first1=Paul|last2=Garavan|first2=Carrie|pmid=34368690|pmc=8336035}}</ref>

In North Kivu and Ituri, outbreaks of sporadic violence and suspicion of the response in parts of some affected communities impacted heavily on disease surveillance. Poor record keeping by local health facilities also made it difficult or impossible to identify and trace contacts that might have been exposed to the disease while they were undergoing treatment for other illness at health centers. Additionally, the high degree of mobility of affected populations, combined with occasional mistrust of the response has meant that contacts that had been identified have sometimes been lost to follow-up for extended periods.<ref>{{Cite web|last=WHO|date=2019|title=WHO's response to the 2018-2019 Ebola outbreak in North Kivu and Ituri, the Democratic Republic of the Congo|url=https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/documents/emergencies/drc-ebola-response-srp-1-3-october2019.pdf?sfvrsn=41319fa1_2|access-date=16 December 2020|website=}}</ref> Initially, it was estimated that 30-50% of contacts may not have originally been registered by contact tracing teams.<ref>{{Cite web|title=DRC Ebola outbreak crisis update {{!}} MSF|url=https://www.msf.org/drc-ebola-outbreak-crisis-update|access-date=2020-12-16|website=Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) International|language=en}}</ref>

=== Community engagement and awareness ===
Surveys among the affected population in North Kivu and Ituri showed both general mistrust with the Ebola response, partly related to years of mistrust of any governmental or external action, and specific opposition to the response because of conflicts with local cultural practices.<ref name=":4">{{Cite journal|last1=Masumbuko Claude|first1=Kasereka|last2=Underschultz|first2=Jack|last3=Hawkes|first3=Michael T.|date=2019-09-26|title=Social resistance drives persistent transmission of Ebola virus disease in Eastern Democratic Republic of Congo|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=14|issue=9|pages=e0223104|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0223104|issn=1932-6203|pmc=6762146|pmid=31557243|doi-access=free}}</ref> Some of the cultural practices which complicated the Ebola response included eating bush meat, regular gatherings at family or village events, and traditional funeral practices, which were events that were particularly high risk for Ebola transmission.<ref name=":4" /> Additionally, people from the affected region reported that their perception of security and trust in the government, as well as humanitarian workers, declined over the course of the outbreak, complicating an already complex response.<ref>{{Cite web|last1=Vinck |first1=P |last2=Pham |first2=P |last3=Makoond |first3=A |date=March 2018 |title=Voices from Congo: Peacebuilding and Reconstruction Polls|url=http://www.peacebuildingdata.org/sites/m/pdf/DRC_Poll13_english_final.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181123105623/http://www.peacebuildingdata.org/sites/m/pdf/DRC_Poll13_english_final.pdf |archive-date=2018-11-23  |access-date=16 December 2020|website=peacebuildingdata.org |publisher=Harvard Humanitarian Initiative, United Nations Development Program }}</ref>

==== Misinformation ====
{{See also|Ebola conspiracy theories}}
Combatting misinformation was a key element in overcoming Ebola in North Kivu. One study using surveys found that low institutional trust coupled with a belief in misinformation about Ebola were inversely associated with preventive behaviors in individuals, including Ebola vaccine acceptance.<ref name=":5">{{Cite journal|last1=Vinck|first1=Patrick|last2=Pham|first2=Phuong N|last3=Bindu|first3=Kenedy K|last4=Bedford|first4=Juliet|last5=Nilles|first5=Eric J|date=2019|title=Institutional trust and misinformation in the response to the 2018–19 Ebola outbreak in North Kivu, DR Congo: a population-based survey|journal=The Lancet Infectious Diseases|language=en|volume=19|issue=5|pages=529–536|doi=10.1016/S1473-3099(19)30063-5|pmid=30928435|doi-access=free}}</ref> Belief in misinformation regarding Ebola was widespread, with 25% of respondents reporting that they did not believe the Ebola outbreak was real. Some of the rumors that were being circulated included statements that the outbreak did not exist, it was [[Ebola conspiracy theories#Origins theories|fabricated by the authorities for financial gains]], or was fabricated to destabilize the region.<ref name=":5" /> Approximately 68% of respondents reported that they did not trust the local authorities to represent their interest, and community trust in the Ebola response was often further undermined by misinformation spread by local politicians.<ref name=":5" />

==== Delay in seeking treatment ====
Early in the epidemic there were delays in patients seeking care for Ebola because the initial cases were misdiagnosed. Ebola symptoms were similar to symptoms of more common infectious diseases such as malaria, flu, and typhoid fever so patients would wait until their clinical situation deteriorated dangerously, usually after failure to respond to anti-malarial and/or antibiotic regimens, before reporting to the hospitals.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Inungu|first1=Joseph|last2=Iheduru-Anderson|first2=Kechi|last3=Odio|first3=Ossam J|date=2019-11-20|title=Recurrent Ebolavirus disease in the Democratic Republic of Congo: update and challenges|journal=AIMS Public Health|volume=6|issue=4|pages=502–513|doi=10.3934/publichealth.2019.4.502|issn=2327-8994|pmc=6940573|pmid=31909070}}</ref>

=== Burials ===
The [[International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies|IFRC]] has called funerals "super-spreading events" as burial traditions include kissing and generally touching bodies. Safe burial teams formed by health workers are subject to suspicion.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.voanews.com/africa/congolese-anti-ebola-fighter-killed-new-vaccine-arrives|title=Congolese Anti-Ebola Fighter Killed as New Vaccine Arrives|website=Voice of America|date=3 November 2019 |access-date=2019-11-04}}</ref>

===Travel restrictions and border closings===
On 26 July 2019, it was reported that the country of [[Saudi Arabia]] would not allow visas from the DRC after the WHO declared it an international emergency due to EVD.<ref>{{cite news |title=Saudi Arabia suspends visas to people from Congo over Ebola |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/saudi-arabia-suspends-visas-to-people-from-congo-over-ebola/2019/07/26/32ab67ac-af91-11e9-9411-a608f9d0c2d3_story.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190726122531/https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/saudi-arabia-suspends-visas-to-people-from-congo-over-ebola/2019/07/26/32ab67ac-af91-11e9-9411-a608f9d0c2d3_story.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=26 July 2019 |newspaper=The Washington Post |access-date=26 July 2019 }}</ref> On 1 August 2019, the country of Rwanda closed its border with the DRC after multiple cases in the city of Goma, which borders the country in the upper Northwestern region.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Doshi |first1=Vidhi |title=Rwanda closes border with DRC over deadly Ebola outbreak |url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/aug/01/rwanda-closes-border-with-dr-congo-over-deadly-ebola-outbreak-goma |website=The Guardian |access-date=1 August 2019 |date=1 August 2019}}</ref>

To minimize the risk of the spread to neighboring countries, screening points which consisted of temperature and symptom monitoring were established at many border crossings. Over 2 million screenings were undertaken during the outbreak which no doubt contributed to the containment of the epidemic within DRC.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Screening for Ebola on the Uganda-Democratic Republic of the Congo border - Uganda|url=https://reliefweb.int/report/uganda/screening-ebola-uganda-democratic-republic-congo-border|access-date=2020-12-16|website=ReliefWeb|date=12 July 2019 |language=en}}</ref>

==Treatment==
{{further|Ebola virus disease treatment research}}

In August 2018, the WHO evaluated several drugs used to treat EVD, including [[Remdesivir]], [[ZMapp]], [[atoltivimab/maftivimab/odesivimab]], [[ansuvimab]] and [[favipiravir]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Notes for the record: Consultation on Monitored Emergency Use of Unregistered and Investigational Interventions (MEURI) for Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) |url=https://www.who.int/ebola/drc-2018/notes-for-the-record-meuri-ebola.pdf |publisher=World Health Organization (WHO) |access-date=11 September 2018}}</ref> The drug ansuvimab (which is a [[monoclonal antibody]]) was deployed for the first time to treat infected individuals during this EVD outbreak.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-begins-testing-ebola-treatment-early-stage-trial|title=NIH begins testing Ebola treatment in early-stage trial|date=23 May 2018|work=National Institutes of Health (NIH)|access-date=15 October 2018}}</ref>

On 8 August 2018, the process of vaccination began with [[rVSV-ZEBOV]] [[Ebola vaccine]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Ebola vaccination begins in North Kivu |url=https://reliefweb.int/report/democratic-republic-congo/ebola-vaccination-begins-north-kivu |website=ReliefWeb |date=9 August 2018 |access-date=9 August 2018 }}</ref> While several studies have shown the vaccine to be safe and protective against the virus, additional research is needed before it can be licensed. Consequently, the WHO reported that it was being used under a [[ring vaccination]] strategy with what is known as "[[compassionate use]]" to protect persons at highest risk of the Ebola outbreak, i.e. contacts of those infected, contacts of those contacts, and front-line medical personnel.<ref>{{cite web |title=Ebola Virus Disease |url=https://www.who.int/ebola/drc-2018/faq-vaccine/en/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180520013909/http://www.who.int/ebola/drc-2018/faq-vaccine/en/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=20 May 2018 |publisher=World Health Organization (WHO) |access-date=29 January 2019}}</ref> As of 15 September, according to the WHO, almost a quarter of a million individuals had been vaccinated in the outbreak.<ref name=none/>

====Pregnant and lactating women====
Based on a lack of evidence about the safety of the vaccine during pregnancy, the DRC ministry of health and the WHO decided to cease vaccinating women who were pregnant or lactating. Some authorities criticized this decision as ethically "utterly indefensible". They noted that as caregivers of the sick, pregnant and lactating women are more likely to contract Ebola. They also noted that since it is known that almost 100% of pregnant women who contract Ebola will die, a safety concern should not be a deciding factor.<ref>{{cite web |title=Pregnant and lactating women should be vaccinated in an Ebola outbreak – STAT |url=https://www.statnews.com/2018/08/27/ebola-vaccine-pregnant-lactating-women/ |website=STAT |access-date=2 September 2018 |date=27 August 2018}}</ref> As of June 2019, pregnant and lactating women were also being vaccinated.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/19-06-2019-who-flags-critical-funding-gap-calls-for-political-parties-to-join-fight-against-ebola |title = WHO flags critical funding gap, calls for political parties to join fight against Ebola}}</ref>

Learning from other responses, such as in the [[List of Ebola outbreaks|2000 outbreak in Uganda]], the WHO established its [[Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network]], and other public health measures were instituted in areas at high risk. Field laboratories were established to confirm cases, instead of shipping samples to [[South Africa]].<ref>{{Cite journal | pmid=15630468 | doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0010059 | title=Containing the Threat—Don't Forget Ebola | year=2004 | last1=Cohen | first1=Jonathan | journal=PLOS Medicine | volume=1 | pages=e59 | issue=3 | pmc=539049 | doi-access=free }}</ref> Additionally, the outbreak was closely monitored by the CDC Special Pathogens Branch.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/spb/mnpages/whoweare.htm | title=Mission Statement | date=31 October 2007 | publisher=National Center for Infectious Diseases & Centers for Disease Control and Prevention | access-date=3 May 2019 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304092940/http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/spb/mnpages/whoweare.htm | archive-date=4 March 2016 | url-status=dead }}</ref>{{CSS image crop

==Statistical measures==
One way to measure the outbreak is via the [[basic reproduction number]], ''R''<sub>0</sub>, a statistical measure of the average number of people expected to be infected by one person with a disease. If the basic reproduction number is less than 1, the infection dies out; if it is greater than 1, the infection continues to spread—with exponential growth in the number of cases.<ref>{{cite web|title=Basic Reproductive Rate (Ro)|url=http://practice.sph.umich.edu/micphp/epicentral/basic_reproduc_rate.php|publisher=University of Michigan|access-date=16 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141104222957/http://practice.sph.umich.edu/micphp/epicentral/basic_reproduc_rate.php|archive-date=4 November 2014|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> A March 2019 paper by Tariq ''et al.'' suggested that ''R''<sub>0</sub> was oscillating around 0.9.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Tariq |first1=A. |last2=Roosa |first2=K. |last3=Mizumoto |first3=K. |last4=Chowell |first4=G. |title=Assessing reporting delays and the effective reproduction number: The Ebola epidemic in DRC, May 2018 – January 2019 |journal=Epidemics |date=March 2019 |volume=26 |pages=128–133 |doi=10.1016/j.epidem.2019.01.003 |pmid=30880169 |display-authors=3 |doi-access=free }}</ref>

==Response==
During the Ebola outbreak in Democratic Republic of the Congo, a number of organizations helped in different capacities:
[[Caritas Internationalis|CARITAS]] DRC, [[CARE International]], Cooperazione Internationale (COOPE), Catholic Organization for Relief and Development Aid (CORDAID/PAP-DRC), [[International Rescue Committee]] (IRC), [[Médecins Sans Frontières]] (MSF), [[Oxfam]], [[International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies]] (IFRC), [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] (ICRC), and [[Samaritan's Purse]].<ref name=response />

===WHO===
[[File:World Health Organization Logo.svg|thumb|100px|WHO has only declared six PHEICs in its history.<ref>{{cite web |title=Archived: WHO Timeline - COVID-19 |url=https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/27-04-2020-who-timeline---covid-19 |website=www.who.int |access-date=12 July 2020 }}</ref>]]
On 12 April 2019, the WHO Emergency Committee was reconvened by the WHO Director-General after an increase in the rate of new cases, and determined that the outbreak still failed to meet the criteria for a [[Public Health Emergency of International Concern]] (PHEIC).<ref name=PHEIC_12_April_2019>{{cite web |url=https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/12-04-2019-statement-on-the-meeting-of-the-international-health-regulations-(2005)-emergency-committee-for-ebola-virus-disease-in-the-democratic-republic-of-the-congo-on-12th-april-2019 |title=Statement on the meeting of the International Health Regulations (2005) Emergency Committee for Ebola virus disease in the Democratic Republic of the Congo on 12th April 2019 |publisher=World Health Organization |date=12 April 2019 |access-date=12 April 2019 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/ihr-emergency-committee-on-ebola-virus-disease-in-the-democratic-republic-of-congo-north-kivu |title=IHR Emergency Committee on Ebola virus disease in the Democratic Republic of Congo, North Kivu |author=Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus |publisher=World Health Organization |date=12 April 2019 |access-date=13 April 2019 }}</ref>

====Sex abuse accusations====
In September 2021, a commission found that between 2018 and 2020, WHO staff had engaged in sex abuse and rape. The report prompted WHO's chief [[Tedros Adhanom]] to issue a formal apology to those women and girls affected.<ref>{{cite news |title='Negligence' by WHO staff to blame for sexual abuse in DRC, independent commission says |url=https://www.france24.com/en/africa/20210928-negligence-by-who-staff-to-blame-for-sexual-abuse-in-drc-independent-commission-says |access-date=28 September 2021 |work=[[France24]] |date=28 September 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Farge |first1=Emma |last2=Holland |first2=Hereward |title=WHO employees took part in Congo sex abuse during Ebola crisis, report says |url=https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/who-heartbroken-by-congo-sex-abuse-probe-findings-2021-09-28/ |access-date=28 September 2021 |work=Reuters |date=28 September 2021}}</ref>

===World Bank===
The [[World Bank]] was criticised when its [[Pandemic Emergency Financing Facility]], intended to support countries affected by pandemic diseases, had only paid out $31&nbsp;million of a potential total of $425&nbsp;million by August 2019 while generating substantial returns for investors.  The conditions used to decide when the fund should pay out to disease-affected countries were criticised as too stringent.<ref name="nature19">{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/d41586-019-02415-9|pmid=31409936|bibcode=2019Natur.572..285J|journal=Nature|volume=572|page=285|title=Pandemic bonds: designed to fail in Ebola|first1=Olga|last1=Jonas|issue=7769|date=13 August 2019|doi-access=free}}</ref>

===International governments===
Financial support has been contributed by the governments of the US and the UK, among others. The UK [[Department for International Development|DfID]] minister, [[Rory Stewart]], visited the area in July 2019, and called for other western countries, including [[Canada]], [[France]] and [[Germany]], to donate more financial aid.

==Subsequent outbreaks and other regional health issues==
===2020 Équateur province===
On 1 June 2020, the Congolese health ministry announced a new DRC outbreak of Ebola in [[Mbandaka]], [[Équateur Province]], a region along the Congo River. This area was the site of the [[2018 Équateur province Ebola outbreak]], which infected 53 people and resulted in 29 deaths. That outbreak was quickly brought under control with the use of the Ebola vaccine.

Genome sequencing suggested that this 2020 outbreak, the 11th outbreak since the virus was first discovered in the country in 1976, was unrelated to the one in North Kivu Province or the previous outbreak in the same area in 2018.  It was reported that six cases had been identified with four fatalities. It was expected that more people would be identified as surveillance activities increased.<ref name="auto1"/>

The WHO assisted with the response to this outbreak in part using the structures put in place for the 2018 outbreak. Testing and contact tracing was used and additional medical staff had been sent in.<ref>{{cite web |title=New Ebola outbreak detected in northwest Democratic Republic of the Congo; WHO surge team supporting the response |url=https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/01-06-2020-new-ebola-outbreak-detected-in-northwest-democratic-republic-of-the-congo-who-surge-team-supporting-the-response#:~:text=New%20Ebola%20outbreak%20detected%20in%20northwest%20Democratic%20Republic%20of%20the,surge%20team%20supporting%20the%20response&text=The%20Government%20of%20the%20Democratic,%2C%20Mbandaka%2C%20in%20%C3%89quateur%20province. |website=World Health Organization |access-date=7 June 2020}}</ref> [[Médecins Sans Frontières]] was also on hand to give assistance if needed. The outbreak added to an already difficult time for the Congo due to both [[Coronavirus disease 2019|COVID-19]] cases and a [[2019–2020 measles outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo|large measles outbreak]] that has caused more than 7,000 deaths as of August 2020.<ref name="msf.org"/>

By 8 June, a total of 12 cases had been identified in and around Mbandaka and 6 deaths due to the virus. The WHO said 300 people in Mbandaka and the surrounding Équateur province had been vaccinated.<ref>{{cite web |title=Up to 12 Infected in Congo's New Ebola Outbreak: WHO |url=https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2020-06-08/up-to-12-infected-in-congos-new-ebola-outbreak-who |website=USNews |access-date=8 June 2020}}</ref> By 15 June the case count had increased to 17 with 11 deaths, with more than 2,500 people having been vaccinated.<ref>{{cite web |title=17 infected, 11 dead in new Ebola outbreak in DR Congo |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/06/17-infected-11-dead-ebola-outbreak-dr-congo-200615112609457.html |website=www.aljazeera.com |access-date=15 June 2020}}</ref> On 17 October, it had increased to 128 cases and 53 deaths, despite an effective vaccine being available.<ref>{{cite web |title=DR Congo's latest Ebola outbreak 'under control' |url=https://medicalxpress.com/news/2020-10-dr-congo-latest-ebola-outbreak.html |website=medicalxpress.com |access-date=19 October 2020 |language=en}}</ref> As of 18 November, the World Health Organization has had no reported cases of Ebola in Équateur province for 42 days; therefore the outbreak is over.<ref name="2020over1"/> In the end there were 130 cases and 55 dead due to the virus.<ref name="2020over2"/>
