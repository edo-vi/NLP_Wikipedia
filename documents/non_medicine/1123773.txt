''Literary fiction'' is often used as a synonym for [[literature]], in the exclusive sense of writings specifically considered to have considerable [[Art|artistic]] merit.<ref>"written work valued for superior or lasting artistic merit". ("Literature", OED).</ref> While literary fiction is commonly regarded as artistically superior to [[genre fiction]], the two are not mutually exclusive, and major literary figures have employed the genres of [[science fiction]], [[crime fiction]], [[Romance novel|romance]], etc., to create works of literature. Furthermore, the study of genre fiction has developed within academia in recent decades.<ref name=":02" />{{Rp|page=115, 131}}<ref>Matthew Schneider-Mayerson, "Popular Fiction Studies: The Advantages of a New Field".

[[Slipstream genre]] is sometimes located in between the genre and non-genre fictions.

==Characteristics==

=== Definition ===
Literary fiction may involve a concern with [[social commentary]], [[political criticism]], or reflection on the [[human condition]].{{sfn|Saricks|2009|p=180}} This contrasts with genre fiction where plot is the central concern.{{sfn|Saricks|2009|pp=181–82}} It may have a slower pace than popular fiction.{{sfn|Saricks|2009|p=182}} As [[Terrence Rafferty]] notes, "literary fiction, by its nature, allows itself to dawdle, to linger on stray beauties even at the risk of losing its way."{{sfn|Rafferty|2011}} Other works may be more concerned with [[style (fiction)|style]] and complexity of the writing: Saricks describes literary fiction as "elegantly written, lyrical, and ... layered".{{sfn|Saricks|2009|p=179}}

As opposed to [[genre fiction]], literary fiction refers to the realistic fiction of human character, or more broadly, "all serious prose fiction outside the market genres", the genres being for example [[science fiction]], [[fantasy]], [[Thriller (genre)|thrillers]] or [[Western (genre)|Westerns]].<ref name="mainstream1"/> Jeff Prucher defined mainstream literature as "realistic literature... that does not belong to a marketing category (especially science fiction, fantasy or [[Horror fiction|horror]])".<ref name=":02"/>

In the context of science fiction, [[Brian Stableford]] defined literary fiction as "a tradition that had been and remained stubbornly indifferent to, if not proudly ignorant of, the progress of science".<ref>{{Cite book |last=Stableford |first=Brian |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pH9sBgAAQBAJ&dq=%22a+tradition+that+had+been+and+remained+stubbornly+indifferent+to%2C+if+not+proudly+ignorant+of%2C+the+progress+of+science%22&pg=PR21 |title=Science Fact and Science Fiction: An Encyclopedia |date=2006-09-06 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-135-92373-0 |pages=xxi |language=en}}</ref> [[James E. Gunn]] wrote that "The SF community uses the word mainstream to describe the fiction that is getting the attention they want; the word is a confession that SF is felt to be a sidestream, a tributary.<ref name=":1">{{Cite book |last=Gunn |first=James E. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hioYAAAAIAAJ&q=The+New+encyclopedia+of+science+fiction |title=The New Encyclopedia of Science Fiction |date=1988 |publisher=Viking |isbn=978-0-670-81041-3 |language=en |chapter=Mainstream}}</ref> 

Gunn also noted the difference between commercial and literary mainstreams, with the former meaning authors whose works are popular{{snd}}high-selling bestsellers{{snd}}and the latter, works seen as "art". He also noted that there is a contradiction between these, as "high sales figures are generally taken to mean the author has [[Selling out|sold out]]" and left the literary mainstream. He further defined the literary mainstream as "dominated by the academic-literary community—university professors of literature; high-powered critics for prestige publications such as the ''[[The New York Times Book Review|New York Times Book Review]]'', ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', and ''[[The New Yorker]]'': and writers who take the first two groups seriously". According to Gunn, the field of literary fiction in the United States is significantly framed by fiction of the early 20th century and classic canon made from works of authors such as [[Virginia Woolf]], [[James Joyce]] or [[Henry James]] (all from European descent).<ref name=":1"/>

=== Classic book ===
Literary fiction includes [[classic book]]s: that is works in any discipline that have been accepted as being exemplary or noteworthy. This includes being listed in a list of [[great books]]. The terms "classic book" and "[[Western canon]]" are closely related concepts, but they are not necessarily synonymous. A "canon" refers to a list of books considered to be "essential" and is presented in a variety of ways. It can be published as a collection, such as [[Great Books of the Western World]], [[Modern Library]], or [[Penguin Classics]], or presented as a list by an academic such as [[Harold Bloom]]'<ref>{{cite book|author=Bloom, Harold|title= The Western Canon: The Books and School of the Ages|url=https://archive.org/details/westerncanonbook00bloorich|url-access=registration|location= New York|publisher= Harcourt Brace & Company|date= 1994}}</ref> or be the official reading list of an institution of higher learning.<ref name="Stjohnscollege.edu">{{cite web|url=http://www.stjohnscollege.edu/academic/readlist.shtml |title=St. John's College &#124; Academic Program &#124; The Reading List |publisher=Stjohnscollege.edu |access-date=2010-06-13 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527090156/http://www.stjohnscollege.edu/academic/readlist.shtml |archive-date=May 27, 2010 }}</ref>

[[Robert M. Hutchins]] in his 1952 preface to the ''Great Books of the Western World'' declared:

:Until lately the West has regarded it as self-evident that the road to education lay through great books. No man was educated unless he was acquainted with the masterpieces of his tradition. There never was very much doubt in anybody's mind about which the masterpieces were. They were the books that had endured and that the common voice of mankind called the finest creations, in writing, of the Western mind.<ref>Hutchins, Robert M., ed. (1952). ''Great Books of the Western World'' (Chicago: Encyclopedia Britannica), v. 1, p. xi.</ref>

However, [[Ben Bova]], remarking on the distinction between genre and non-genre works, noted that "the literature of the fantastic was the mainstream of world storytelling from the time writing began until the beginning of the [[17th century|seventeenth century]]", and that older classics have more in common with modern, fantastical genre works than with the genre of literary, mainstream fiction.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Herbert |first=Frank |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w7xO2N8RGGMC&q=The+literature+of+the+fantastic+was+the+mainstream |title=Nebula Winners: Fifteen |date=1981 |publisher=Harper & Row |isbn=978-0-06-014830-0 |pages=175 |language=en}}</ref>

=== High culture ===
Literary fiction can be considered an example of "[[high culture]]" and contrasted with "[[popular culture]]" and "[[mass culture]]".<ref>''The Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (1967) Volume 1. p. 167.</ref>

The poet and critic [[Matthew Arnold]] defined "culture", in ''[[Culture and Anarchy]]'' (1869), as "the disinterested endeavour after man's perfection" pursued, obtained, and achieved by effort to "know the best that has been said and thought in the world".<ref>{{cite book|title=[[Culture and Anarchy]]|first=Matthew|last=Arnold|date=1869|publisher=[[The Cornhill Magazine]]|author-link=Matthew Arnold}}{{Gutenberg|no=4212|name=Culture and Anarchy|date=2003}}</ref> Such a literary definition of high culture also includes [[philosophy]]. The philosophy of [[aesthetics]] proposed high culture as a force for moral and political good.

=== Literary merit ===

Since 1901 the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] has frequently been awarded to the authors of literary fiction. This annual award is presented to a writer from any country who has, in the field of [[literature]], produced the most outstanding work in an [[Idealism (arts)|idealistic]] direction.<ref name='nobelorglit'>{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/alfred-nobel/alfred-nobels-testamente/ |title=Alfred Nobel will |access-date=20 January 2021 | work=nobelprize.org}}</ref><ref name='swedishref'>{{cite news | author=John Sutherland | title=Ink and Spit | publisher=The Guardian | url =http://books.guardian.co.uk/review/story/0,,2189673,00.html | work =Guardian Unlimited Books |date=13 October 2007 | access-date = 13 October 2007 }}</ref> Though individual works are sometimes cited as being particularly noteworthy, the award is based on an author's body of work as a whole.

The [[International Booker Prize]] is a similar British award given for outstanding literary fiction translated into English. This complements the earlier [[Booker Prize]], which is awarded to fiction in the English language. For both judges are selected from amongst leading literary critics, writers, academics and public figures. The Booker judging process and the very concept of a "best book" being chosen by a small number of literary insiders is controversial for many.<ref name="notthebooker">{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/series/not-the-booker-prize | title=Not the Booker prize | newspaper= The Guardian | date=16 October 2017}}</ref> Author [[Amit Chaudhuri]] wrote: "The idea that a 'book of the year' can be assessed annually by a bunch of people – judges who have to read almost a book a day – is absurd, as is the idea that this is any way of honouring a writer."<ref name="bookercrit">{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/aug/16/booker-prize-bad-for-writing-alternative-celebrate-literature | title=My fellow authors are too busy chasing prizes to write about what matters |first= Amit |last=Chaudhuri|newspaper=The Guardian | date=15 August 2017}}</ref>

== Criticism ==
In an interview, [[John Updike]] lamented that "the category of 'literary fiction' has sprung up recently to torment people like me who just set out to write books, and if anybody wanted to read them, terrific, the more the merrier ... I'm a genre writer of a sort. I write literary fiction, which is like spy fiction or chick lit."{{sfn|Grossman|2006}} Likewise, on ''[[The Charlie Rose Show]]'', Updike argued that this term, when applied to his work, greatly limited him and his expectations of what might come of his writing, so he does not really like it. He suggested that all his works are literary, simply because "they are written in words."<ref name=":0">[http://www.charlierose.com/view/interview/356 ''The Charlie Rose Show'' from June 14, 2006 with John Updike] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090203054558/http://www.charlierose.com/view/interview/356 |date=February 3, 2009 }}</ref>

[[James E. Gunn|James Gunn]] noted that genre fans and critics criticize mainstream as mundane, with the term's "deliberate overtones of dullness, worldliness, and uninspired realism". He criticized mainstream fiction as becoming increasingly stagnant and marginalized.<ref name=":1" /> This view has been echoed by others, for example [[Adam Roberts (British writer)|Adam Robert]] wrote: "It's not that SFF [science fiction and fantasy] is a ghetto inside the glorious city of "Literary Fiction", but the reverse. "Literary" novels sell abominably badly, by and large; popular culture in the main belongs to SF and Fantasy, eighteen of the top twenty highest grossing movies of all time are SFF, everybody recognises SFF icons and memes'".<ref>{{Cite web |last=Notion |first=Dream |date=2018-07-07 |title='We're Winning the War': A Q&A with SF writer, critic and historian, Adam Roberts |url=https://factordaily.com/adam-roberts-interview/ |access-date=2022-08-31 |website=FactorDaily |language=en-US}}</ref> 

Critics and readers of mainstream fiction have been accused of "[[Snob|snobbery]]" when it comes to their dislike of genre fiction.<ref>{{Cite web |title=SFE: Genre SF |url=https://sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/genre_sf |access-date=2022-08-31 |website=sf-encyclopedia.com}}</ref>
