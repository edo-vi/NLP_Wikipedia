'''Ulcerative dermal necrosis ''' ('''UDN''') is a  chronic dermatological disease of cold water [[salmonid]] fish that had a severe impact on north Atlantic [[Salmon]] and [[Brown trout|sea trout]] stocks in the late 1960s and 1970s–1980.<ref name="Roberts 2012">{{cite book |last1=Roberts |first1=R.J. |editor1-last=Roberts |editor1-first=Ronald J. |title=Fish pathology |date=2012 |publisher=Wiley Blackwell |isbn=9781444332827 |pages=435–438 |edition=4th |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WZRJnq41pfUC&pg=PA435 |chapter=Miscellaneous non-infectious diseases.

Although the worst effects of the disease were seen in the 1970s and 1980, even now large numbers of salmon will succumb to the disease after spawning. This is thought be due in part to their weak post-spawning condition, and lack of food for several months whilst in the river.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}
