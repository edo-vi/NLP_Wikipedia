=== 2019–20 season ===
[[File:2020 European Figure Skating Championships Ice dancing medal ceremonies 2020 01 25 7596.jpg|left|thumb|265px|Sinitsina/Katsalapov claim gold at the [[2020 European Figure Skating Championships|2020 European Championships]]]]
Sinitsina/Katsalapov started their season at the [[2019 CS Ondrej Nepela Memorial]], where they won the gold medal.<ref name=ONM2019/>  On the [[2019-20 ISU Grand Prix of Figure Skating|Grand Prix]], they began at the [[2019 Cup of China]], where they placed first in the rhythm dance with a new personal best score.<ref name=GS191108/>  The finished second in the free dance, behind [[Madison Chock]]/[[Evan Bates]], but their rhythm dance lead was sufficient to give them the gold medal.

In what would prove to be their final competition of the season, Sinitsina/Katsalapov competed at the [[2020 European Figure Skating Championships|2020 European Championships]] in [[Graz]].  After the rhythm dance, they were in second place, separated from five-time defending champions [[Gabriella Papadakis|Papadakis]]/[[Guillaume Cizeron|Cizeron]] by only 0.05 points.<ref name=GS200123/>  In a close result, they won the free dance and took the title overall by a margin of 0.14 points.  This marked the first time anyone had beaten Papadakis/Cizeron since [[Tessa Virtue|Virtue]]/[[Scott Moir|Moir]] at the [[Figure skating at the 2018 Winter Olympics - Ice dance|2018 Winter Olympics]], and the first time they had been defeated in the free dance since the [[2016-17 Grand Prix of Figure Skating Final|2016–17 Grand Prix Final]].  The result was considered a major upset, with Katsalapov remarking "to get anywhere near Gabriella and Guillaume seemed impossible for all the skaters."<ref name=GS200125/><ref name=IFS200125/>

The European result generated immediate speculation that Sinitsina/Katsalapov could challenge Papadakis/Cizeron for the World gold at the [[2020 World Figure Skating Championships|2020 World Championships]] in [[Montreal]], but these were cancelled as a result of the [[2019-20 COVID-19 pandemic|coronavirus pandemic]].<ref name=CBC200311/>

Due to Katsalapov recovering from an injury, the team missed the 2020 Russian senior test skates.<ref name=IFS300924/>  Sinitsina/Katsalapov thus began the season at the second stage of the domestic Russia Cup, but had to withdraw midway through the free dance after Sinitsina suffered severe tendon inflammation.<ref name=RSP201011/>

Following recovery, the duo had their first full competition at the [[2020 Rostelecom Cup]], placing first in the rhythm dance by a wide margin.<ref name=GS201119/>  They struggled toward the end of their free dance, which Sinitsina said was their "first full run-through", but remained comfortably first in both the segment and overall.<ref name=GS201121/>  They subsequently withdrew from the fifth stage of the Russian Cup and the [[2021 Russian Figure Skating Championships|2021 Russian Championships]] due to medical issues.<ref name=TASS201217/>  Katsalapov subsequently indicated that both had contracted [[COVID-19]], with his being a mild case while hers was "severe" and damaged her lungs.  The two were announced as performing in a New Year's skating show to help regain competitive form.<ref name=ZV201222/>

Following a victory at the Russian Cup Final, Sinitsina/Katsalapov were assigned to the [[2021 World Figure Skating Championships|2021 World Championships]], to be held without an audience in [[Stockholm]]. Four-time and defending champions Papadakis/Cizeron declined to attend due to their own illness with COVID and lack of training time, leading to much speculation that Sinitsina/Katsalapov were the frontrunners to claim the World title.<ref name=GS210318/> They won both the rhythm and free dances to take the gold medal, setting personal bests for the free dance and total score.<ref name=GS210326/><ref name=GS210327/> Their placement combined with the fifth-place finish of [[Alexandra Stepanova|Stepanova]]/[[Ivan Bukin|Bukin]] qualified three berths for Russian ice dance at the [[2022 Winter Olympic Games]] in [[Beijing]].<ref name=ISU-2022OWG/>

Sinitsina/Katsalapov finished the season at the [[2021 ISU World Team Trophy in Figure Skating|2021 World Team Trophy]], where they finished first in both of their segments and Team Russia won the gold medal.<ref name=GS210415/><ref name=GS210416/><ref name=GS210417/>

=== 2021–22 season ===
After debuting their programs at the Russian senior test skates, Sinitsina/Katsalapov withdrew from a planned appearance on the domestic Russian Cup series due to Katsalapov suffering a back injury.<ref name=RSP211011/>

Making their season debut on the [[2021-22 ISU Grand Prix of Figure Skating|Grand Prix]] at the [[2021 NHK Trophy]], Sinitsina/Katsalapov won the gold medal. Speaking after the free dance, Katsalapov credited the crowd for it support, and said that "we want to improve further, but for now we are happy. Our program is about us, our career and hopefully with a bright finish."<ref name=GS211113/> They won a second gold at the [[2021 Rostelecom Cup]].<ref name=GS211127/> The results qualified them for the [[2021-22 Grand Prix of Figure Skating Final|Grand Prix Final]], to be held in [[Osaka]], but it was subsequently cancelled due to restrictions prompted by the [[SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant|Omicron variant]].<ref name=CBC211202/>

Seeking to win their third national title at the [[2022 Russian Figure Skating Championships|2022 Russian Championships]], Sinitsina/Katsalapov won the rhythm dance.

In response to this, the [[International Skating Union]] banned all Russian and Belarusian athletes from competing at the [[2022 World Figure Skating Championships|2022 World Championships]], bringing an end to Sinitsina and Katsalapov's international season.

==Support of Russia's invasion of Ukraine==
On 18 March 2022, Sinitsina and Katsalapov appeared at Putin's [[2022 Moscow rally|Moscow rally]] celebrating the [[annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|annexation of Crimea]] from Ukraine in 2014 and justifying the invasion of Ukraine. They both wore the [[Z military symbol]] used by the Russian invading army in Ukraine.<ref name=VG220318/><ref name=Sports220318/> Sinitsina and Katsalapov's presence at the rally was criticized by their former training partners, Ukrainian ice dancers [[Oleksandra Nazarova]] and [[Maksym Nikitin]], who spent weeks caught in the [[Battle of Kharkiv (2022)|siege of Kharkiv]].

In December 2022, the Ukrainian Parliament sanctioned Sinitsina and Katsalapov for their support of the war.<ref name=ITG221213/>
