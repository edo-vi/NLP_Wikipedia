{{short description|Manufacturing process}}
In the [[pharmaceutical industry]], '''fill and finish''' (also referred to as '''fill finish''', '''fill-finish''' or '''fill/finish''') is the process of filling [[vial]]s with [[vaccine]], biological and pharmaceutical Drug Substances (DS) and finishing the process of packaging the medicine for distribution. Many vaccine manufacturers use third parties to fill and finish their vaccines.<ref name="vaccinedevelopment.org.uk">{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=26 July 2020|title=Fill / finish|url=http://www.vaccinedevelopment.org.uk/fill-finish.html|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=|website=www.vaccinedevelopment.org.uk}}</ref>

The fill/finish process is a common bottleneck in the manufacturing and deployment of vaccines.<ref name="vaccinedevelopment.org.uk" /><ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=6 April 2020|title=Vaccine Taskforce Aims|url=https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/893417/S0135_Vaccine_Taskforce_Aims.pdf|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-07-26|website=assets.publishing.service.gov.uk}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Pagliusi|first1=Sonia|last2=Jarrett|first2=Stephen|last3=Hayman|first3=Benoit|last4=Kreysa|first4=Ulrike|last5=Prasad|first5=Sai D.|last6=Reers|first6=Martin|last7=Hong Thai|first7=Pham|last8=Wu|first8=Ke|last9=Zhang|first9=Youn Tao|last10=Baek|first10=Yeong Ok|last11=Kumar|first11=Anand|date=July 2020|title=Emerging manufacturers engagements in the COVID −19 vaccine research, development and supply|url= |journal=Vaccine|language=en|volume=38|issue=34|pages=5418–5423|doi=10.1016/j.vaccine.2020.06.022|pmc=7287474|pmid=32600908}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last1=Miller|first1=Joe|last2=Kuchler|first2=Hannah|date=2020-04-28|title=Drugmakers race to scale up vaccine capacity|url=https://www.ft.com/content/87d1170a-78bc-11ea-bd25-7fd923850377|access-date=2020-07-26|website=www.ft.com|language=en-GB}}</ref>

To address this problem, in 2013 the U.S. federal government created the Fill Finish Manufacturing Network, a network of third-party provider contracts intended to perform fill and finish operations for  vaccines against future infectious diseases.<ref>{{Cite web|title=HHS boosts national capacity to produce pandemic flu vaccine: New fill and finish manufacturing network strengthens pandemic readiness|url=https://www.phe.gov/Preparedness/news/Pages/fill-finish-130930.aspx|access-date=2020-07-26|website=www.phe.gov}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Fill Finish Manufacturing Network|url=https://www.medicalcountermeasures.gov/barda/core-services/fill-finish-manufacturing-network/|access-date=2020-07-26|website=www.medicalcountermeasures.gov}}</ref> As part of its response to the [[COVID-19 pandemic]], the UK government has provided financial support for fill and finish operations.<ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=20 July 2020|title=Millions could be vaccinated against COVID-19 as UK secures strong portfolio of promising vaccines|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/millions-could-be-vaccinated-against-covid-19-as-uk-secures-strong-portfolio-of-promising-vaccines|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-07-26|website=GOV.UK|language=en}}</ref>
