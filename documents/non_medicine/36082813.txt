{{History of American football}}

[[Concussion]]s and play-related head blows in [[American football]] have been shown to be the cause of [[chronic traumatic encephalopathy]] (CTE), which has led to player deaths and other debilitating symptoms after retirement, including memory loss, [[depression (mood)|depression]], anxiety, headaches, stress, and sleep disturbances.<ref>{{Cite book|title=concussions|last=Meehan III|first=William|year=2017|isbn=9781440838941|location=Santa Barbara, California}}</ref>

According to [[Boston University]], CTE is a brain degenerative disease found in athletes, military veterans, and others with history of repetitive brain trauma. Although CTE is highly controversial and misunderstood, it is believed that a protein called Tau forms clumps that slowly spread throughout the brain, killing brain cells.

There is also theoretical research that suggests early CTE might result from damaged blood vessels within the brain. That could trigger brain inflammation and, eventually, the development of proteins such as Tau believed to play a key role in CTE. This hypothesis was tested on adult mice; the researchers state that their brains possess similar attributes to that of human brains. Using a special device, the mice were given precise impacts that would lead to mild brain traumas similar to what an athlete would suffer in contact sports. The mice, whose brains were scanned using a specialized MRI, immediately showed changes to the electrical functions of their brains.<ref>Tagge, C. A., Fisher, A. M., Minaeva, O.

== NFL concussions ==
{{Essay-like|section|date=October 2023}}
The NFL has constantly been trying to make changes and make it so none of this serious damage happens for much longer. Even in this article they state," Concussions in the NFL remain a key focus for player safety and injury prevention. The decreased incidence observed in 2018 and 2019 has provided a new benchmark from which to work toward further reduction in concussive injury in the NFL." People are constantly trying to state that the NFL doesn't do anything to help the players but they are always trying the fix or help lessen these issues.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Greenhow |first=Annette |date=2011-01-01 |title=Concussion policies of the National Football League: Revisiting the 'Sport Administrator's Charter' and the role of the Australian Football League and National Rugby League in concussion management |url=https://slgj.scholasticahq.com/article/6398-concussion-policies-of-the-national-football-league-revisiting-the-sport-administrator-s-charter-and-the-role-of-the-australian-football-league-an |journal=Sports Law and Governance Journal |language=en |volume=1 |issue=1 |doi=10.53300/001c.6398}}</ref> 

NFL concussions have always been a big issue but now there is backlash because of all the former players experiencing things due to these concussions. We have seen many players go out and completely change who they are and go crazy because of all of this contact with the brain. Studies have shown that so much contact with the head can affect how you act and think. It is very scary and the NFL is trying very hard to make it so there are ways to play with a much reduced risk of injury to the head.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Greenhow |first=Annette |date=2011-01-01 |title=Concussion policies of the National Football League: Revisiting the 'Sport Administrator's Charter' and the role of the Australian Football League and National Rugby League in concussion management |url=https://slgj.scholasticahq.com/article/6398-concussion-policies-of-the-national-football-league-revisiting-the-sport-administrator-s-charter-and-the-role-of-the-australian-football-league-an |journal=Sports Law and Governance Journal |language=en |volume=1 |issue=1 |doi=10.53300/001c.6398}}</ref> 

NFL concussions have increased by 18% since 2022. '''Practitioners''' think the concussion percentage should be going down instead of going up due to new technology and studies on helmets. Sills said, "We continue to become more cautious and conservative in our evaluation and diagnosis of concussions," "That's not just an opinion. That's backed up by the data." The NFL needs to change something about the helmets so the numbers decrease in concussion.. <ref>{{Cite journal |last=Greenhow |first=Annette |date=2011-01-01 |title=Concussion policies of the National Football League: Revisiting the 'Sport Administrator's Charter' and the role of the Australian Football League and National Rugby League in concussion management |url=https://slgj.scholasticahq.com/article/6398-concussion-policies-of-the-national-football-league-revisiting-the-sport-administrator-s-charter-and-the-role-of-the-australian-football-league-an |journal=Sports Law and Governance Journal |language=en |volume=1 |issue=1 |doi=10.53300/001c.6398}}</ref>

== History ==
[[File:WCMorris Spokesman-Review cartoons 099 (1).jpg|thumb|1908 cartoon (by [[William Charles Morris|W.C. Morris]]) highlighting the dangers that were associated with the sport]]
A [[concussion]] is a frequent injury among football players. Concussions occur when the head is subject to a large impact force, resulting in a minor brain injury.  There has been a growing concern about concussions since the early 1900s.  In 1906, a Harvard student-athlete died from a head injury and the team doctors released a report titled "The Physical Aspect of American Football" in the Boston Medical and Surgical Journal describing the type, severity, and number of injuries the team sustained in the 1905 season.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Harrison|first1=Emily|title=The First Concussion Crisis; Head Injury and Evidence in Early American Football|journal= American Journal of Public Health|date=May 2014|volume=104|issue=5|pages=822–33|pmc=3987576|pmid=24625171|doi=10.2105/AJPH.2013.301840}}</ref>

The NFL first began to review the subject formally in 1994, then [[NFL Commissioner]] [[Paul Tagliabue]] approved the creation of the Mild Traumatic Brain Injury (MTBI) Committee with the stated goal of studying the effects of concussions and sub-concussive injury in NFL players. Tagliabue appointed [[rheumatologist]] Elliot Pellman to chair the committee.<ref name="Peter">{{cite web|last=Peter|first=Peter|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espnmag/story?id=3644940|title=Elliot Pellman, the NFL's top medical adviser, claims it's okay for players with concussions to get back in the game. Time for a second choice|publisher=ESPN Sports|access-date=2013-09-03|date=2006-11-06}}</ref> Pellman's appointment was met with harsh criticism, because he is not a neurologist or [[neuropsychologist]] and often admitted ignorance about head injuries.<ref name="Peter"/> The concussion data collected by the league from 1996 to 2001 has been shown to understate the actual number of diagnosed concussions by ten percent.  The league additionally relied on legal counsel who were actively involved in downplaying health risks in the tobacco industry.<ref>Alan Schwarz, Walt Bogdanich and Jacqueline Williams. (24 March 2016). "In NFL, Deeply Flawed Concussion Research and Ties to Big Tobacco " The New York Times. (New York). Retrieved 24 March 2016.

The same year, the [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH) reported a statistically significant increase in the risk of [[neurological]] disorders such as [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]] (ALS) in retired football players, which furthered public knowledge about the risk of long-term neurocognitive disease related to repeated head impacts.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/hhe/reports/pdfs/1988-0085-letter.pdf|title=Concussion in professional football: helmet testing to assess impact performance – part 11|publisher=[[United States Public Health Service]] [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]]|date=2004-01-10|access-date=2013-09-03}}</ref> Despite the NIOSH study, Pellman and the MTBI Committee drew their own conclusions that continued to contradict these findings and those of other organizations. Biomechanical engineers and neurosurgeons informed the Committee that the helmet safety standard at that time was insufficient to minimize the risk of concussions.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Concussion in professional football: helmet testing to assess impact performance – part 11|date=January 2006|pmid=16385332|volume=58|issue=1|vauthors=Pellman EJ, Viano DC, Withnall C, Shewchenko N, Bir CA, Halstead PD |pages=78–96; discussion 78–96|journal=Neurosurgery|doi=10.1227/01.neu.0000196265.35238.7c|s2cid=10666909}}</ref>

The MTBI Committee began studying the nature of [[Tackle (American football)|tackle]] plays resulting in concussive impacts and developing its own biomechanical analysis of the effect of these forces on the brain.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Practice parameter: the management of concussion in sports (summary statement).

A six-year study by the Committee concluded that, "Players who are concussed and return to the same game have fewer initial signs and symptoms than those removed from play. Return to play does not involve a significant risk of a second injury either in the same game or during the season."<ref>{{cite journal|title=Concussion in professional football: players returning to the same game – part 7 |pmid=15617589 | volume=56|issue=1 |vauthors=Pellman EJ, Viano DC, Casson IR, Arfken C, Feuer H |pages=79–90; discussion 90–92|journal=Neurosurgery|doi=10.1227/01.neu.0000150180.16552.8d|year=2005 |s2cid=29653958 }}</ref>

== Research ==
Other organizations continued to publish study results that linked repeated concussions and long-term health problems contrary to reports by the MTBI Committee. A 2003 report by the Center for the Study of Retired Athletes at the [[University of North Carolina]], for example, found a connection between numerous concussions and depression among former professional football players. Further, the center's follow-up study in 2005 associated both brain impairment and Alzheimer's disease with retired NFL players who had histories of concussions.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Association between recurrent concussion and late-life cognitive impairment in retired professional football players. |pmid=16239884 | volume=57|issue=4 |date=Oct 2005|pages=719–26|journal=Neurosurgery|doi=10.1227/01.NEU.0000175725.75780.DD|last1=Guskiewicz |first1=K.

A 2004 doctoral dissertation by Don Brady examined NFL Players' knowledge of concussions, studying both active and retired National Football League Players' knowledge of concussions. Brady's findings concluded: that many NFL players lacked accurate and essential knowledge pertaining to various aspects of a concussion; that the preponderance of credible experimental and clinical evidence pertaining to the adverse effects of concussion indicates that the brain is injured as a result of a concussion; that the altered cell functioning and cell death along with subtle to more visible neurological, neurocognitive, psychological, and other medical problems reflect a diverse range of lifelong negative consequences of a concussion / brain injury; and that sports team health-care personnel need to focus primarily on the athletes' health and well-being, and not minimize an injury or primarily concentrate on the players' capacity to perform on the field. This expanded focus of health care is necessary in order to avoid any real or perceived conflicts of interest emerging in the concussion research, concussion management and related return to play decision-making process.<ref name=Brady04>{{cite thesis |type=Ph.D. |first=Don |last=Brady |title=A Preliminary Investigation of Active and Retired NFL Players' Knowledge of Concussions |publisher=The Union Institute and University |year=2004}}</ref>

During November 2014, Brady filed objections to the proposed NFL concussion settlement offer. Brady sent a cover letter and detailed objections on behalf of NFL retired players to the presiding US district court judge, Anita Brody.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.footballvets.org/blog/2014/11/dr-don-brady-files-objection/|title=Dr. Don Brady Files Objection to NFL Concussion Settlement Offer|work=Footballvets.org|date=November 19, 2014|access-date=June 18, 2015|archive-date=October 12, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151012111936/http://www.footballvets.org/blog/2014/11/dr-don-brady-files-objection/|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In addition to the studies that continued to contradict the work of the MTBI Committee, renowned experts and sports journalists wrote critical reviews of the committee's studies. Robert Cantu of the [[American College of Sports Medicine]] noted bias in the committee's extremely small sample size and held that no conclusions should be drawn from the NFL's studies. In an ESPN Magazine article titled "Doctor Yes," Peter Keating criticized Pellman and the MTBI Committee's work and argued that the "... Committee has drawn a number of important conclusions about head trauma and how to treat it that contradict the research and experiences of many other doctors who treat sports concussions, not to mention the players who have suffered them."<ref name="Peter"/>

More studies continued to associate repetitive head injuries with neurological problems later in life. [[Kevin Guskiewicz]], Director of the Center for the Study of Retired Athletes in the Department of Exercise and Sport Science at the University of North Carolina, analyzed data from a 2007 study of nearly 2,500 former NFL players. He found about 11 percent of the study participants suffered from [[clinical depression]], with a threefold increased risk in former players who had a history of three or four concussions.<ref>{{cite news|agency = Associated Press|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/31/sports/football/31concussions.html?pagewanted=all|title = NFL Study Links Concussions, Depression|work=New York Times|date = 2007-05-31|access-date = 2015-10-04}}</ref> The following year, the NFL commissioned the [[University of Michigan Institute for Social Research]] to conduct a study involving more than 1,000 former NFL players. The results reported that Alzheimer's disease or similar diseases appear to have been diagnosed in former NFL players vastly more often than in the general population at a rate of 19 times the normal rate for men ages 30 through 49. The NFL responded to these results by claiming the study was incomplete.<ref>{{cite news|author = Ken Belson|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/13/sports/football/actuarial-reports-in-nfl-concussion-deal-are-released.html|title = Dementia Risk Seen in Players in NFL Study|work=New York Times|date = 2014-09-12|access-date = 2015-10-04}}</ref>

On September 30, 2014, researchers with [[Boston University]] announced that in autopsies of 79 brains of former NFL players, 76 had tested positive for CTE.<ref name="Breslow">{{cite web|last=Breslow|first=Jason|date=30 September 2014|title=76 of 79 Deceased NFL Players Found to Have Brain Disease|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/sports/concussion-watch/76-of-79-deceased-nfl-players-found-to-have-brain-disease/|publisher=PBS|access-date=13 November 2014}}</ref> As of January 2017, that number had grown to 90 out of 94.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bu.edu/cte/our-research/case-studies/|title=Case Studies » CTE Center {{!}} Boston University|website=www.bu.edu|access-date=2016-11-04}}</ref> A study published in ''[[The Journal of the American Medical Association]]'' in July 2017 showed that 110 of 111 former NFL players whose brains were examined were found to have suffered from CTE.<ref name="110of111">{{cite news|last1=Ward|first1=Joe|last2=Williams|first2=Josh|last3=Manchester|first3=Sam|title=111 NFL Brains.

== Effects of concussions ==
{{Essay-like|section|date=October 2023}}
Concussions are such a big issue in the NFL today.{{Editorializing|date=October 2023}} Many findings suggest that the onset of dementia-related syndromes may be initiated by repetitive cerebral concussions in professional football players. Studies have shown that "The purpose of our study was to investigate the association between previous head injury and the likelihood of developing mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease in a unique group of retired professional football players with previous head injury exposure." With this being said, it is an issue if head injuries are causing these issues.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Greenhow |first=Annette |date=2011-01-01 |title=Concussion policies of the National Football League: Revisiting the 'Sport Administrator's Charter' and the role of the Australian Football League and National Rugby League in concussion management |url=https://slgj.scholasticahq.com/article/6398-concussion-policies-of-the-national-football-league-revisiting-the-sport-administrator-s-charter-and-the-role-of-the-australian-football-league-an |journal=Sports Law and Governance Journal |language=en |volume=1 |issue=1 |doi=10.53300/001c.6398}}</ref>

CTE and other issues have been a very serious issue being caused by severe brain damage in football. According to ESPN, "The brain of former Kansas City Chiefs linebacker Jovan Belcher -- the 25-year-old player who shot and killed his girlfriend in 2012 before committing suicide -- showed signs of pervasive brain damage like that found in other deceased NFL players, according to a neuropathologist." With a lot of studies, doctors were able to see that players with CTE or other brain damage have more chance to go out and act like this due to having so much brain damage.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Greenhow |first=Annette |date=2011-01-01 |title=Concussion policies of the National Football League: Revisiting the 'Sport Administrator's Charter' and the role of the Australian Football League and National Rugby League in concussion management |url=https://slgj.scholasticahq.com/article/6398-concussion-policies-of-the-national-football-league-revisiting-the-sport-administrator-s-charter-and-the-role-of-the-australian-football-league-an |journal=Sports Law and Governance Journal |language=en |volume=1 |issue=1 |doi=10.53300/001c.6398}}</ref> 

== Helmets to help protect the players ==
In the article, Sports Law and Governance, it talks about how over 2,000 former NFL players are dealing with concussions later on in life. The players are complaining and the league is getting sued for how the helmets have led players to have severe lifelong brain damage. The NFL has been responding with a new "HIT" system helping players not get these problems so easily.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Greenhow |first=Annette |date=2011-01-01 |title=Concussion policies of the National Football League: Revisiting the 'Sport Administrator's Charter' and the role of the Australian Football League and National Rugby League in concussion management |url=https://slgj.scholasticahq.com/article/6398-concussion-policies-of-the-national-football-league-revisiting-the-sport-administrator-s-charter-and-the-role-of-the-australian-football-league-an |journal=Sports Law and Governance Journal |language=en |volume=1 |issue=1 |doi=10.53300/001c.6398}}</ref> 

Wildman, a sports scientist shows how much of an ongoing criticism is about NFL helmets and just helmets in general. The NFL finally acknowledged the negative impact concussions have on its billion-dollar business and opted to start awarding research grants geared toward finding a solution. They are constantly trying to make better ways to protect the players without '''restraining''' them. The newest thing being done on the helmets is to make them more like a car bumper.<ref>{{Citation |last=Morrison |first=Daniel R. |title=Football Helmet Safety and the Veil of Standards |date=2019 |url=https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.4324/9780429028175-4/football-helmet-safety-veil-standards-daniel-morrison |work=Sociocultural Examinations of Sports Concussions |pages=59–77 |access-date=2023-10-26 |publisher=Routledge |doi=10.4324/9780429028175-4 |isbn=978-0-429-02817-5|s2cid=213916625 }}</ref>

The Journal of Sociocultural Examanations of Sports Concussion, it shows significant data on concussions and every way the NFL is trying to protect the players as much as they can. No matter what it is they are always trying to figure out a new helmet or new material to use to make it a lot safer for players if they take a lot of big blows to the head area.

== Concussion protocol process ==
When a [[American football|football]] player sustains a [[concussion]] in the NFL, he is required to go through the concussion protocol the league has in place by the NFL Head, Neck and Spine Committee:<ref name=":0">{{cite web|url=http://static.nfl.com/static/content/public/photo/2013/10/01/0ap2000000254002.pdf|title=NFL Head, Neck and Spine Committee's Protocols Regarding Diagnosis and Management of Concussion|website=NFL|access-date=March 20, 2017}}</ref>

=== Preseason evaluation ===
Before the NFL season starts, all players and coaching staff of an organization are required to be educated on concussions and the importance of promptly reporting any concussion symptoms. All players in the league are also mandated to take a baseline [[neurological]] and [[Physical examination|physical exam]]. The baseline neurological exam is either a computerized or paper and pencil exam that will test different brain functions. The exam tests attention span, memory, language, speech skills, reasoning, planning, and organizational skills. The results of this test are used as a baseline if a player suffers a head injury at any point throughout the season.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.webmd.com/brain/neuropsychological-tests#1|title=Neuropsychological Tests|work=WebMD|access-date=2017-04-03}}</ref> The preseason physical examination allows the team physician and athletic trainer the opportunity to review and answer any questions the player might have. This also gives the physician and athletic trainer the time to go over any previous concussions, discuss the importance of reporting any symptoms of a concussion, and explain the concussion protocol that is in place for the current season.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1">{{Cite news|url=https://www.si.com/nfl/nfl-concussion-protocol-policy-history|title=What is the NFL's concussion protocol?|last=Flynn|first=Erin|work=SI.com|access-date=2017-03-20}}</ref>

=== In-game identification ===
Current NFL concussion protocol creates positions in each organization's medical staff who are specifically charged with identifying and diagnosing concussions. One of these roles involves an unaffiliated neurotrauma consultant who work with other team physicians and [[athletic trainer]]s to conduct evaluations. Another position involves athletic trainers who are positioned in the booth at every game to spot potential concussions in players from both teams. These spotters review film throughout the game that could possibly result in concussions and are capable to call "medical timeouts" to relay that information to the medical personnel on the sidelines so that further evaluation can be conducted. These spotters have been in use since the [[2011 NFL season|2011 season]].<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" />

=== In-game evaluation ===
If a player shows to have a concussion or concussion symptoms, it is mandatory that the individual be removed from the game. If the player is diagnosed with a concussion, they are prohibited from re-entering the game or practice that day. According to the league's protocol, signs of a concussion include: loss of consciousness, lack of balance, holding head after contact, absentmindedness, lethargy, confusion or a visible facial injury in combination with any of the other factors. If the medical staff rule the player clear from a concussion, then the video of that hit must be reviewed before the player can re-enter the game or practice.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" />

=== Post-game ===
After a concussion has occurred, the player must be monitored and examined on a daily basis in a training room by the team medical staff until fully cleared from concussion. Along with the continuous examination prior to a concussion, the player must meet standards that are in place by the league in order to return a game or contact practice. The player may not return to football activities until he has returned to his baseline [[cognitive function]]. Next, the player must go through a graduated exercise challenge, followed by a gradual return to practice and play. If player is feeling any setback or post- concussion symptoms, evaluation then starts from the beginning. Finally, the team doctor and an unaffiliated neurotrauma consultant must both clear him for return to play.<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":0" />

== NFL litigation ==

===Denial by the League===
The NFL spent years trying to deny and cover up any link that emerged connecting head injuries sustained while playing football with long-term brain disorders. The NFL Mild Traumatic Brain Injury (MTBI) Committee, first formed in 1994, reported in December 1999 that the number of head injuries had remained "remarkably the same over the course of four years."<ref name="ReferenceA">Ezell, Lauren. "Timeline: The NFL's Concussion Crisis." PBS.</ref> The committee went a step further in 2004 when it suggested in an article published in ''Neurosurgery'' that "NFL players have evolved to a state where their brains are less susceptible to injury." Two months after that, MTBI publishes another article that concludes "Players who are concussed and return to the same game have fewer initial signs and symptoms than those removed from play. Return to play does not involve a significant risk of a second injury either in the same game or during the season."<ref name="ReferenceA"/> However, when Dr. [[Bennet Omalu]] examined the brain of former Pittsburgh Steeler [[Mike Webster]], he discovered a new brain disease, which he called [[chronic traumatic encephalopathy]], or CTE. He outlined his findings in a scientific paper published in ''Neurosurgery'' in July 2005.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> The NFL's MTBI committee wrote in May 2006 that the article be retracted. Dr. Omalu instead wrote a second paper in the same magazine, this time about former Pittsburgh Steeler [[Terry Long (American football)|Terry Long]].<ref name="ReferenceA"/> Dr. Ira Casson, who was then co-chair of MTBI, denied in a televised interview that there was any link between head injuries sustained playing in the NFL and long-term brain damage. His repeated denials won him the nickname "Dr. No."<ref name="ReferenceA"/> In September 2009, ''The New York Times'' published an article of an NFL-funded study stating that former players are 19 times more likely than the general population to have dementia, Alzheimer's or other memory-related diseases. The NFL's spokesperson, Greg Aiello, publicly said, "the study did not formally diagnose dementia, that it was subject to shortcomings of telephone surveys."<ref name="ReferenceA"/> Two months later, Aiello told ''New York Times'' reporter [[Alan Schwarz]] that "it's quite obvious from the medical research that's been done that concussions can lead to long-term problems."<ref>Schwarz, Alan. "N.F.L Acknowledges Long-Term Concussion Effects." The New York Times, December 20, 2009.</ref> It was the first time any League official had acknowledged a link between the two.

Things got worse for the NFL when investigative reporters [[Steve Fainaru]] and his brother [[Mike Fainaru-Wada]] learned from an anonymous source that the NFL Retirement Board had awarded "disability payments to at least three former players after concluding that football caused their crippling brain injuries – even as the league's top medical experts for years consistently denied any link between the sport and long-term brain damage."<ref name="ReferenceB">Fainaru, Steve, and Mark Fainaru-Wada. "NFL Board Paid $2M to Players While League Denied Football-Concussion Link." PBS.</ref> One of the cases was that of Mike Webster, who filed a claim in 1999. In 2005, three years after his death, his family received $1.8 million from the Retirement Board. "That same year", write the Fainuru brothers, "the NFL published the 10th installment in its series on concussions research in the medical journal ''Neurosurgery.'' The paper, whose authors included three members of the League's [MTBI], asserted that chronic brain injury 'has never been reported in American football players.{{' "}}<ref name="ReferenceB"/>

Since Aiello's admittance, the link between head injuries in football and long-term brain damage have become more accepted in the NFL. In a roundtable discussion with the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] Committee on Energy and Commerce, Jeff Miller, the NFL's senior vice-president for health and safety, admitted that "there is a link between football-related head trauma and chronic traumatic encephalopathy."<ref>Fainuru, Steve. "NFL acknowledges, for first time, link between football, brain disease." ESPN.</ref> However, public relations issues continue to plague the League. A report from the Democratic members of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce said that "the NFL rescinded a gift to the [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH) for concussion research when it learned the study's findings would be detrimental to the league's image."<ref>Vasilogambros, Matt. "The NFL's Concussion Cover-Up." The Atlantic, May 23, 2016</ref> The NFL had tried to funnel the funds it gave to the NIH towards its own studies. The League rejected the accusations.<ref>Fainaru, Steve, and Mark Fainaru-Wada. "Congressional report says NFL waged improper campaign to influence government study." ESPN.</ref>

To mitigate the public relations (PR) nightmare, the NFL has taken several steps to better assure player safety and bring awareness to head injuries in football players of all ages. Several rule changes took place between 2007 and 2014. NFL commissioner Roger Goodell issued a memo in December 2009 to all 32 teams stating that a player who sustains a concussion cannot return to play if he shows signs or symptoms, such as inability to remember assignments or plays, a gap in memory and persistent dizziness. This move changed the 2007 rule saying a player cannot return only if he has lost consciousness.<ref>NFL "Goodell issues memo changing return-to-play rules for concussions."</ref> Additionally, new rules regarding "crown of the helmet" tackles have been installed where a runner or a tackler cannot initiate forcible contact with the crown of the helmet outside the [[tackle box (American football)|tackle box]] so as to protect players' heads.<ref>Smith, Michael David. "NFL officiating video stresses new "crown of the helmet" rule." NBC Sports.</ref> Lastly, the NFL and [[USA Football]] launched the [https://usafootball.com/programs/heads-up-football/ Heads Up Football] initiative, which "emphasizes a smarter and safer way to play and teach youth football, including proper tackling and taking the head out of the game."<ref>NFL "NFL celebrates USA Football Month with launch of USA Football's Heads Up Football initiative."</ref> A mobile application was also launched with help from the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] where information about concussion protocols and player health and safety can be easily reached by parents and coaches.

The PR issues surrounding the NFL's cover-up of concussions are far from over, and it is too early to tell how and to what extent these events will impact the NFL or football playing. Robert Boland, professor of sports management at [[New York University]] and former college football player says, "In the short-run, [the NFL] is still thriving", but downward trends in youth football players shows that future generations "might have less of an intimate attachment to the sport."<ref name="ReferenceC">Drummond, Katie. "Can the NFL survive its concussion crisis?." The Verge.</ref> Boland says this in light of [[Pop Warner]] football enrollment dropping by 9.5 percent between 2010 and 2012, likely linked to the high-profile concussion problem.<ref name="ReferenceC"/>

===Federal NFL concussion litigation===
In April 2011, attorneys Sol H. Weiss and [[Larry E. Coben]] from the Philadelphia law firm of Anapol Weiss filed a federal lawsuit on behalf of [[Ray Easterling]], [[Jim McMahon]] and five other players. Thousands of former NFL players have since filed lawsuits against the League after suffering repeated concussions throughout their careers.

The multidistrict litigation (MDL) titled In re: National Football League Players' Concussion Injury Litigation (MDL 2323) was filed on January 31, 2012, in the [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania]]. Judge [[Anita B. Brody]] presides over the matter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dockets.justia.com/docket/pennsylvania/paedce/2:2012md02323/457890/|title=MDL-2323 in re: National Football Players' Concussion Injury Litigation|date=2012-01-31|access-date=2013-09-03}}</ref> The master administrative long-form [[complaint]], filed by Plaintiff's Co-Lead Counsel Sol Weiss and [[Christopher A. Seeger|Christopher Seeger]] on June 7, 2012, alleges the League "... was aware of the evidence and the risks associated with repetitive traumatic brain injuries virtually at the inception, but deliberately ignored and actively concealed the information from the Plaintiffs and all others who participated in organized football at all levels." The master complaint argues the NFL knew or should have known players who sustain repetitive head injuries are at risk of suffering "... early-onset of Alzheimer's Disease, [[dementia]], depression, deficits in [[cognitive function]]ing, reduced processing speed, attention, and reasoning, loss of memory, sleeplessness, moods swings, personality changes, and the debilitating and latent disease known as [[Chronic traumatic encephalopathy]] ('CTE')."

In April 2012, Easterling was found dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound in his home.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/news/five-nfl-players-whove-died-self-inflicted-gunshot-002000760--nfl.html|title=Five NFL Players Who've Died from a Self-Inflicted Gunshot Wound|publisher=Yahoo!

One month later, former [[San Diego Chargers]] player [[Junior Seau]] also died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, and a brain autopsy showed he suffered from CTE.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/espn/otl/story/_/id/8830344/study-junior-seau-brain-shows-chronic-brain-damage-found-other-nfl-football-players|title=Doctors: Junior Seau's brain had CTE|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=2013-01-13|access-date=2013-09-03}}</ref>

Like Easterling and Seau, an autopsy of Bears safety [[Dave Duerson]]'s brain after he committed [[suicide]] earlier that year revealed he also suffered from the same degenerative brain disease.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/03/sports/football/03duerson.html?_r=0|title=Duerson's Brain Trauma Diagnosed|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=2011-05-13|access-date=2013-09-03|first=Alan|last=Schwarz}}</ref>

The autopsy results following these players' suicides heightened existing concerns regarding the connection between player deaths and concussions.

In August 2012, the number of players involved in suits against the NFL increased to 3,402, and the League sued three dozen insurance companies in an attempt to force them to cover the costs of defending claims of not protecting players. However, [[The Travelers Companies|Travelers]] ultimately sued the League on August 21 in a lawsuit called Discover Property & Casualty Co. et al. vs. National Football League et al., [[New York State Supreme Court]], New York County, No. 652933/2012. The company provided liability coverage for the League's merchandising arm (NFL Properties), and the insurer also pointed out that the above-mentioned lawsuit has allegedly 14 counts against the League, while only two against NFL Properties.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ax|first=Joseph|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/news/travelers-sues-nfl-over-ex-players-brain-injury-184938731--nfl.html|title=Travelers sues NFL over brain injury lawsuits|publisher=Yahoo!

A federal hearing was held on April 9, 2013, in Philadelphia to discuss the League's motion to dismiss the lawsuits brought on behalf of more than 4,500 former players. On July 8, 2013, Judge Brody ordered representatives of both sides of the litigation to explore a possible settlement in the litigation. Judge Brody ordered a report on or before September 3, 2013, regarding the results of the mediation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nflconcussionmdl.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Order-on-mediation-7-8-13.pdf|title=Mediation Order|access-date=2013-03-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222173311/http://www.nflconcussionmdl.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Order-on-mediation-7-8-13.pdf|archive-date=2014-02-22|url-status=dead}}</ref>

A proposed settlement was reached in the litigation on August 29, 2013. Under the agreement, the NFL will contribute $765 million to provide medical help to more than 18,000 former players. Retired players who suffer severe neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's and [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]] (ALS) diseases in the future will also be eligible to apply for medical help. In addition, $10 million will fund brain injury research as well as safety and education programs.<ref>{{cite web|last=Martin|first=John|url=http://articles.philly.com/2013-08-31/news/41622052_1_retired-players-former-players-ray-easterling|title=NFL ex-players reach $765 million deal in concussion case|publisher=[[Philly.com]]|date=2013-08-29|access-date=2013-03-18}}</ref>

The settlement says it should not be interpreted as a statement of legal liability on the part of the NFL.<ref>{{cite press release|title=NFL, Retired Players Resolve Concussion Litigation; Court-Appointed Mediator Hails Historic Agreement|publisher=Alternative Dispute Resolution Center|date=August 29, 2013|url=http://nfllabor.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/press-release-2.pdf|access-date=29 August 2013}}</ref>

The settlement, which is projected to protect retired players for nearly 65 years, will compensate injured former players who need immediate help and will provide baseline assessments and medical benefits to those who are symptom-free or beginning to show signs of neurological problems.

"I think it's more important that the players have finality, that they're vindicated, and that as soon as the court approves the settlement they can begin to get screening, and those that are injured can get their compensation. I think that's more important than looking at some documents", attorney Weiss said.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/sports/2013/08/29/nfl-players-reach-proposed-765m-settlement-concussion-related-lawsuits/|title=NFL players reach proposed $765M settlement of concussion-related lawsuits|publisher=[[Fox News]]|date=2013-08-29|access-date=2013-03-18}}</ref>

The settlement also allows a player diagnosed with CTE the eligibility to up to 4 million dollars in compensation. This has been met with criticism of the settlement's structure as it only applies to players diagnosed before the settlements preliminary agreement and disallows those diagnosed after the approval of the deal in July.<ref name="Breslow"/>

Controversy continues to surround the NFL response to concussive injuries among current and former players. Although Mike Webster was the first patient to be diagnosed with CTE, posthumously, being the first diagnosed case and one of the higher profile cases illuminating the issue of head trauma injuries to the NFL, his family has not received financial compensation from the NFL. The reason for this is Webster's died before January 1, 2006, and in the terms of the NFL's settlement agreement, the organization is only responsible for dispersing compensation payments to families of players who died from head related trauma and injuries from 2006 and beyond. The Webster family is currently taking legal action against the National Football League with the goal of removing that qualification from the settlement.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Belson|first=Ken|date=2018-01-13|title=He Helped Ex-Players Get Benefits.

The NFL has paid nearly $1 billion in settlements from claims alleging long-term injuries from repeated blows to the head. Courts have examined these claims using a "Trigger" process. This trigger process includes 4 triggers: The "exposure" trigger, the "manifestation" trigger, the "injury-in-fact" trigger, and the "continuous" trigger.<ref>Reiter, Thomas M., and Lucas J. Tanglen.

The dementia tests that the NFL-approved process used came under scrutiny in 2021, as black players were assumed to have a lower baseline cognitive function than non-black players, making it more difficult to prove dementia in their case.  The practice was called "race-norming" by opponents.  A lawsuit attempting to overturn the practice was thrown out in March 2021 and the judge ordered the parties to resolve it via mediation.<ref>{{cite news |last=Dale |first=Maryclaire |date=March 8, 2021 |title=Judge tosses suit over 'race-norming' in NFL dementia tests |url=https://apnews.com/article/judge-tosses-race-norming-suit-nfl-dementia-tests-ed61e9917fcd94d79c1fe79a13e037e0 |work=Associated Press News |access-date=June 3, 2021}}</ref>  In June 2021, the NFL announced it would end the practice and would form a panel of neuropsychologists to create new, race-neutral standards.<ref>{{cite news |last=Dale |first=Maryclaire |date=June 2, 2021 |title=NFL pledges to halt 'race-norming,' review Black claims |url=https://apnews.com/article/pa-state-wire-race-and-ethnicity-health-nfl-sports-205b304c0c3724532d74fc54e58b4d1d |work=Associated Press News |access-date=June 3, 2021}}</ref>

===Kansas City Chiefs concussion lawsuit===
On December 3, 2013, five former NFL players filed a lawsuit against the [[Kansas City Chiefs]] organization: former Chiefs players [[Alexander Cooper (American football)|Alexander Cooper]], [[Leonard Griffin (American football)|Leonard Griffin]], [[Christopher Martin (American football)|Christopher Martin]], [[Joe Phillips (American football)|Joe Phillips]], and [[Kevin Porter (American football)|Kevin Porter]]. They wish to know what the Chiefs knew about concussions and when they knew it.<ref>{{cite web|last=Paylor|first=Terez|title=Five Former Players Sue Chiefs over Consusisons|url=http://www.kansascity.com/2013/12/03/4666316/five-former-players-suing-chiefs.html#storylink=cpy|work=The Kansas City Star|access-date=3 December 2013}}</ref>

This lawsuit is unique and different from the thousands of lawsuits previously filed against the NFL. These players are not suing the NFL, and are instead suing the Chiefs.

From 1987 to 1993 there was no [[Collective Bargaining Agreement]] established in the NFL. With no existence of a CBA in these years, players who played during this time for the Chiefs can sue the team for many of the same reasons the NFL has been sued. The $765 million settlement in August 2013 between the NFL and former players only protected the NFL. "I think all of our clients were disappointed", McClain said of his clients reaction to the settlement with the NFL.<ref>{{cite web|last=Paylor|first=Terez|title=Five Former Players Suing Chiefs over Concussions|url=http://www.kansascity.com/2013/12/03/4666316/five-former-players-suing-chiefs.html|access-date=3 December 2013}}</ref> The players gordon suing the Chiefs have all opted-out of the settlement from the previous mediation with the NFL.

A law unique to Missouri allows certain former NFL players to sue the individual team. The current Missouri law states that employees can sue employers in civil court if the employees declined worker's compensation. The Independence attorney for the five ex-Chiefs, Ken McClain said, "The lawsuit is allowed in Missouri after a state workers' compensation statute was amended in 2005 to exclude cases of occupational injury that occur over an extended time."<ref>{{cite web|last=Drapper|first=Bill|title=Five ex-Chiefs sue Kansas City over concussions|date=3 December 2013|url=http://www.delcotimes.com/sports/20131203/five-ex-chiefs-sue-kansas-city-over-concussions|publisher=Daily Times|access-date=3 December 2013}}</ref>

The amendment of the 2005 law is set to be changed at the end of December 2013. Martin and McClain have both encouraged former players who are eligible to join the lawsuit before their window of opportunity expires.

On December 1, 2012, [[Jovan Belcher]], a then-current member of the Kansas City Chiefs, shot and killed his fiancée, Kassandra Perkins, before committing suicide in the Arrowhead practice facility parking lot. On behalf of Belcher's and Perkins’ daughter, lawyers have filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the Chiefs. Belcher's mother has filed a similar suit accusing the Chiefs of ignoring Belcher's cries for help as he complained of concussion like symptoms. The first occurrence came against Jacksonville in 2009 where Belcher was knocked unconscious and failed to receive adequate treatment. The second occurrence was against the Bengals in November 2012. The lawsuits allege, Belcher "suffered what should have been recognized as an acute concussion." However, one lawsuit continues, "despite exhibiting obvious symptoms, Decedent was never removed from play for evaluation and recovery." The lawsuits also claims Belcher exhibited signs of CTE, including changes in his mood and behavior.<ref name="Delsohn">{{cite web|last=Delsohn|first=Steve|title=OTL:Belcher's Brain Had CTE Signs|url=http://espn.go.com/espn/otl/story/_/id/11612386/jovan-belcher-brain-showed-signs-cte-doctor-says-report|publisher=ESPN|access-date=30 September 2014|date=2014-09-29}}</ref>

On September 30, 2014, it was announced that the brain of former Kansas City Chiefs player, Jovan Belcher, contained neurofibrillary tangles of tau protein; which is associated with CTE. The tangles were distributed throughout Belcher's hippocampus, an area of the brain involved with memory, learning and emotion. If the findings of CTE come to be true, Belcher's daughter and mother are eligible for up to $4 million under the National Football League's current Collective Bargaining Agreement.<ref name="Delsohn"/>

===Cook County, Illinois Riddell concussion litigation===
On March 11, 2016, the family of deceased San Diego Charger defensive back [[Paul Oliver (American football)|Paul Oliver]] sued helmet-maker [[Riddell Sports Group, Inc.|Riddell]] along with its related corporate entities, in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Chicago, Illinois.  Shortly thereafter, Pro Football Hall of Fame running back and Super Bowl champion [[Paul Hornung]], represented by [[The Brad Sohn Law Firm]] and [[Corboy & Demetrio]], filed a related case against these defendants.  Now, some 100 former professional players have sued Riddell in the consolidated litigation in Cook County, which alleges Riddell to have conspired with the NFL in creating false science.  Riddell's attempt at the same federal labor preemption defense attempted by the NFL failed.  The NFL remains subject to discovery in this case, even though it is a non-party.

The [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]], like the NFL, has been criticized for its handling of concussions, with numerous players having retired from football due to concussions, or have filed lawsuits against the association for failing to protect student-athletes from concussions.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/2013/09/04/former-football-players-sue-ncaa-over-concussions/2762575/|title = Former college football player sues NCAA in federal court over concussions|work=USA Today|date = 2013-09-04|access-date = 2015-10-04}}</ref> In 2011, former players Derek Owens and Alex Rucks filed lawsuits against the association for failing to cover the players' safety.

==Concussions in other leagues==

===NCAA Football===
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2023}}
In the 2003 football season, there was a reported 184 concussions out of the 4251 athletes that participated in that specific football season. That is 6.3% of college football players have reported having a concussion. This number does not include the athletes that fail to report they had a concussion. Out of these athletes that reported their concussion and sat out of competition until released to participate again, 6.5% of these athletes had another concussion occur in the same season.  Concussions are known to be one of the most common injuries in College Football, this is because of the constant contact to these athletes' head. Another reason these concussions are very likely to happen is because, once a concussion is sustained, it is very likely to happen again. In fact an athlete that has sustained a concussion has a 35.1% chance of this injury reoccurring.  The teams athletic trainers have specific guidelines for when their athletes sustain a concussion, and they must follow these guidelines when diagnosing a concussion, and also releasing a player to play after the initial diagnosis of the concussion. Failure to follow the specific concussion protocol will result in harsh punishment against the university. The athletic trainers do not have a specific guideline to how long it takes for their athletes to recover from these concussions, when they feel their athlete is ready to undergo protocol to return to play, is when they will test if their athlete is healthy enough to participate.

Players that have suffered from the concussion, the average of their age was 19.5 years of age, and they had an estimated 8.4 years of experience. Players that have suffered two or more concussions were slightly younger at 19.1 years of age, and had some more experience at 9.1 years of participation. This supports the statement that athletes with more exposure to these helmet to helmet hits will be more prone to concussions. For example, a quarterback that is hit the least amount on the football fields only suffers concussions around 5.6% of the reported concussions, opposed to offensive lineman that suffers about 20.9% of the reported concussions.  The more that the head is exposed to these hits, makes these athletes more susceptible to these head injuries. These injuries do happen in practice, have been known to happen more often during the participation of a game. This is because the athletes are playing with full effort, and the hits are more severe therefore the chances of concussion rise significantly

===Canadian Football League===
In the [[2010 CFL season|2010 season]] for the [[Canadian Football League]], there have been 50 reported concussions; 44.8 percent of players reported having a concussion or concussion-like symptoms, 16.9 percent had confirmed that they had a concussion, and 69.6 percent of all players who suffered from concussions that year suffered from more than one.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reactcanada.org/EN/resources/articles/sport_specific/CFL_DELANEY.pdf|title=Concussions During the 1997 Canadian Football League Season|work=[[Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine]]|access-date=14 June 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222043659/http://www.reactcanada.org/EN/resources/articles/sport_specific/CFL_DELANEY.pdf|archive-date=22 February 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> However, the average of 0.59 concussions per game is lower than the 0.67 recorded by the NFL in 2010.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/sports/football/cfl/argos/article/971336--cfl-concussions-not-always-revealed-to-fans|title=CFL concussions not always revealed to fans|work=The Star|date=2011-04-07|access-date=2012-06-27|location=Toronto}}</ref> The league eventually started a concussion-awareness program with the help of [[Football Canada]], [[Canadian Interuniversity Sport]] (CIS), the [[Canadian School Sport Federation]], the [[Canadian Football League Players Association]] (CFLPA), the [[Canadian Football League Alumni Association]] (CFLAA), and the [[ThinkFirst]] program.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/sports/football/article/985088--canadian-football-tackles-concussions-head-on|title=Canadian football tackles concussions head-on|work=The Star|date=2011-05-03|access-date=2012-06-27|location=Toronto}}</ref> The league eventually pointed out eight protocols:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cfl.ca/article/working-to-promote-concussion-awareness|title=Official Site of the Canadian Football League|publisher=CFL.ca|date=2011-05-03|access-date=2012-06-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111114185222/http://cfl.ca/article/working-to-promote-concussion-awareness|archive-date=2011-11-14|url-status=dead}}</ref>
* Team physicians and therapists are to use a SCAT2 (a medical protocol), to diagnose concussions and preventing athletes from playing until they have been cleared to play.
* All players are to be submitted to IMPACT, which is a form of cognitive testing, during training camp.
* All player concussion assessments in the CFL are to only be used by team physicians and therapists.
* All coaches and players will receive educational items to aid in recognizing signs of a concussion.
* Administrators are to report a change from the expectation that a player returns to the game to one that encourages players to be honest about symptoms.
* The formation of certification programs that teach coaches how to recognize the symptoms of concussions.
* The formation of training programs for coaches that emphasize that players should never use their helmets to tackle.
* A new rule in the amateur football rulebook was implemented that requires officials to report suspected concussed players to the coaching or medical staff during games.

In 2012, ThinkFirst founder and [[Toronto Western Hospital]] neurosurgeon Charles Tator led a study that was conducted by the [[University of Toronto]], which examined the brains of 20 former players with a history of concussions, and compared them to 20 other players without a history of head injury. A separate group of 20 without football experience served as a control group. Also in 2012, the league and Tator announced a partnership to work in a study that would perform postmortem tests on former CFL players to look for signs of CTE.<ref name="Study">{{cite web|url=http://www.cflaa.ca/2012/may-5-2012-former-cfl-players-to-be-studied-for-long-term-concussion-effects/|title=Former CFL players to be studied for long term concussion effects|publisher=Canadian Football League Alumni Association|date=May 5, 2012|access-date=2012-06-27}}</ref>

===Arena Football League===
In the [[Arena Football League]], despite the league's intense play, very few lawsuits have been filed for concussions. The most notable lawsuit against the league was a lawsuit filed by former [[Colorado Crush]] kicker [[Clay Rush]] in 2010, who claimed that he suffered from permanent brain damage due to repeated blows to the head during games.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/19/sports/football/19concussions.html|title=Lawsuit Cites Mishandling of Football Concussions|author=Alan Schwarz|date=18 March 2010|work=The New York Times|access-date=14 June 2012}}</ref> Like the NFL, the AFL prohibits players who suffered from concussions from practicing.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/stories/sports/more-sports/arena-football-league-adopts-strict-guidelines-on-concussions-296455/?p=0|title=Arena Football League adopts strict guidelines on concussions|work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|date=2012-03-29|access-date=2012-06-27}}</ref> In 2008, during the original league's [[2008 Arena Football League season|final season]], the "Shockometer" made its debut at two season-opening games ([[Dallas Desperados]] vs. [[Georgia Force]]/[[San Jose SaberCats]] vs. [[Chicago Rush]]) on 40 player helmets.

===Youth football===
Youth athletes make up 70% of football players in the United States. Every year there are 23,000 nonfatal traumatic brain injuries stemming from playing football that required an emergency visit to the hospital.  Of those visits, 90% of them are children between the ages of 5–18 years old.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Johnson|first1=L. Syd|title=Return to Play Guidelines Cannot Solve the Football-Related Concussion Problem|journal=Journal of School Health|volume=82|issue=4|pages=180–185|doi=10.1111/j.1746-1561.2011.00684.x|pmid=22385091|year=2012}}</ref>

A study conducted from 2010 to 2014 showed that of the 529 million emergency room visits; 819,000 were contact sport related. This accounted for 0.15% of all emergency visits. This number although small, may affect and cause ramifications in the American healthcare system. These figures are represented with nearly 80-90% of that of the youth population (ages 7–18).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=McGinity|first=Michael|date=2018|title=The impact of tackle football injuries on the American healthcare system|pmid=29734348|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0195827|pmc=5937786|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=13|issue=5|pages=e0195827|doi-access=free}}</ref>

One of the first studies of its kind was performed during the Fall 2011 football season when researchers from [[Virginia Tech]], receiving permission from parents, placed [[accelerometer]]s (which measure [[g force]]s) inside the helmets of seven youth players. These seven players were 7- and 8-year-old boys participating in a community youth league who were chosen because they were expected to have high participation and also because they wore at least a youth medium [[Riddell Sports Group, Inc.|Riddell]] Revolution helmet (enabling the accelerometers, [[battery (electricity)|battery]], and wireless transmitter to fit inside the helmet within the padding). That is, these seven were not a random selecting of players. Rather, the purpose of this study was to establish a baseline of what range of hits are generally expected.<ref name=VirginiaTech2011YouthFootballStudy>{{Cite journal | last1 = Daniel | first1 = R.

As way of comparison, a collision of 80g is a big hit in a college football game of which there might be only six per game. And the range of 80, 90, or 100g is generally where risk of acute injury and [[concussion]] begins to occur (concussion being symptoms such as feeling foggy or woozy and not necessarily loss of consciousness). An example of a lesser force of 40g is heading a [[soccer ball]], and even with blows in this 30 to 40g range, it is not known whether these pose a cumulative risk of injury.<ref name=VirginiaTech2011YouthFootballStudy/>

This 2011 study measured a total 753 impacts among these seven players with a median impact of 15g. It did, however, observe 38 impacts of 40g or greater, and six impacts of greater than 80g. Fortunately, none of these youth players experienced a concussion. There is also a concern that since many young players have less developed chest and neck muscles than older players, almost every impact potentially acts likes a surprise hit.<ref name=VirginiaTech2011YouthFootballStudy/>

The Center for Disease Control and Preventions (CDC's) has developed the "Heads Up concussion in Youth Sports." It helps youth coaches, players, and parents be more aware of a concussion. Heads up provides important information on preventing, recognizing and responding to a concussion. 63% of youth coaches viewed concussions being more serious, 72% said they are educating others about concussions, and 50% had learned something new.<ref>{{Cite journal|pmid=22494094|doi=10.1111/j.1746-1561.2012.00692.x|title=Educating Coaches About Concussion in Sports: Evaluation of the CDC's "Heads Up: Concussion in Youth Sports" Initiative|journal=The Journal of School Health|volume=82|issue=5|pages=233–38|last1=Covassin|first1=Tracey|last2= Elbin|first2= R J|last3= Sarmiento|first3= Kelly|date=May 2012}}</ref>

===Concussions in high school football===
Concussions are frequent in high school football. Football has the highest rate of concussion among high school sports, with about 11 concussions occurring per 10,000 athletic exposures.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Breslow|first1=Jason|title=High School Football Players Face Bigger Concussion Risk|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/sports/league-of-denial/high-school-football-players-face-bigger-concussion-risk/|website=Frontline|publisher=PBS|access-date=2 December 2014}}</ref> About 50 high school or younger football players across the country were killed or sustained serious head injuries on the field since 1997.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2007/09/16/sports/20070916_CONCUSSION_GRAPHIC.html?ref=headinjuries&_r=1&|title=Young Players, Serious Injuries|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=2007-09-16|access-date=2013-09-03}}</ref>

Many concussions that occur during high school football often go untreated and are not monitored. This is a big concern because repeated trauma to the head, especially injuries with concussion like symptoms, puts a young athlete's health at serious risk.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Unreported Concussion in High School Football Players: Implications for Prevention |journal=Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine|volume=14|issue=1|pages=13–7|date=January 2004|last1=McCrea|first1=Michael|last2=Hammeke|first2=Thomas|last3=Olsen|first3=Gary|last4=Leo|first4=Peter|last5=Guskiewicz|first5=Kevin|s2cid=15083145|doi=10.1097/00042752-200401000-00003|pmid=14712161}}</ref>  A 2013 study by Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center found that, despite knowing the risk of serious injury from continuing to play with a concussion, half of high school football players would still play if they had a headache from an injury sustained on the field.

More than 90 percent recognized the risk of serious injury if they returned to play too quickly, but more than half of those aware of the risks responded they would "always or sometimes continue to play with a headache sustained from an injury", and only 54 percent indicated they would "always or sometimes report symptoms of a concussion to their coach."<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2013-05/cchm-src050113.php|title=Study raises concerns that teen athletes continue to play with concussion symptoms|publisher=Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center|date=2013-05-06|access-date=2013-09-03}}</ref> Another study found that 15.8% of football players who sustain a concussion severe enough to cause loss of consciousness return to play the same day.

Eleven high schools in North Central Florida agreed to take a written questionnaire evaluating the varsity football teams' knowledge about concussions. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board for the Protection of Human Research Subjects by the University of Florida. The review consisted of three sections. First was to identify symptoms of a concussion, second what they believed were possible consequences from not getting the proper treatment of a concussion, and the last section was to indicate if they have ever received information about concussions. 25% of them had never received information about concussion and only 54% had talked about the issue of a concussion with a parent.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Concussion Knowledge in High School Football Players|journal = Journal of Athletic Training|volume = 49|issue = 5|pages = 654–658|last1= Cournoyer |last2= Tripp|first1=Janie |first2= Brady L.|date=Sep–Oct 2014|pmc = 4208870|pmid = 25162779|doi = 10.4085/1062-6050-49.3.34}}</ref>

==Prevention efforts==
Numerous efforts have attempted to identify potential concussions quickly. Helmet [[shock data logger]]s and [[impact sensor]]s help monitor impacts a player receives.  One example is a device created by [[Schutt Sports]] during the [[Arena Football League]]'s 2008 season known as the "Shockometer"—a triangle-shaped object with adhesive on its side that sticks to players' helmets. When a player gets hit by a [[g-force]] which exceeds 98, a capsule with a green light in it will change to a red light. Doctors have determined that a g-force of approximately 100 will increase the risk of a concussion, even though a quarterback that gets sacked would normally register a g-force of 150 g. A possible flaw to the Shockometer is that fan activity could accidentally trigger the device.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://sports.espn.go.com/extra/afl/news/story?id=3269214|title = Indicator on AFL helmets|work = ESPN|date = 2008-02-28|access-date = 2015-10-04}}</ref> [[Riddell Sports Group, Inc.|Riddell]] created the Head Impact Telemetry System (HITS) and Sideline Response System (SRS) to help record the frequency and severity of player impacts during practices and games.

Vicis, a Seattle-based firm, has created a new unique type of helmet that is very flexible due to the many layers that make up this new intricate helmet. This helmet consists of four layers, beginning with the Lode Shell. This layer absorbs the shock from the hit, which then leads to the Core Layer contorting and bending in all directions. This technology alleviates stress from the impact, which consists of all the linear and rotational forces involved in the hit. The Arch Shell exists directly under the Core Layer and is precisely designed to fit a player's head shape. The last layer, the Form Liner, works with the Arch Shell to apportion pressure evenly around the perimeter of the head. Instead of measuring a player's head the conventional way by taking the circumference, Vicis measures the length and width of the head to get more accurate data. A better fit of the helmet allows for the technology to work more advantageously.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.digitaltrends.com/cool-tech/zero-1-football-helmet-helps-prevent-concussions/|title=Flexible football helmet absorbs hits like a car bumper, could put an end to concussions|date=4 April 2017|website=digitaltrends.com}}</ref> Several NFL players have tried this new helmet and have provided great feedback. Cliff Avril from the Seattle Seahawks said, "You don't feel the thuds as hard as they normally are." In the NFL's 2017 Helmet Laboratory Testing Performance Results, the Vicis helmet finished first out of the 33 helmets that could have been worn in 2017 NFL season.

===NFL===
[[Sean Morey (American football)|Sean Morey]], who was named cochair of the [[National Football League Players Association|NFL Player Association's]] Concussion and Traumatic Brain Injury Committee in October 2009, told Brown Alumni Magazine in early 2010 that "fifty percent of concussions go unreported."

Since then, the National Football League has made numerous rule changes to reduce the number of concussions suffered by players while making the game safer.

In 2010, the NFL reworded the League's rules to prohibit a player from "launching himself off the ground and using his helmet to strike a player in a defenseless posture in the head or neck." Violations of this rule only result in the imposition of a 15-yard unnecessary roughness penalty. In the same season, the NFL mandated that once a player loses his helmet on the playing field, the current play must immediately be whistled dead.<ref name="Thomas 425–452">{{cite journal|last=Thomas|first=Drysdale|date=13 December 2013|title=Helmet-to-Helmet Contact: Avoiding a Lifetime Penalty by Creating a Duty to Scan Active NFL Players for Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy|journal=Journal of Legal Medicine|volume=34|issue=4|pages=425–452|doi=10.1080/01947648.2013.859969|pmid=24328519|s2cid=24595682}}<!--|access-date=17 November 2014--></ref>

Also in 2010, the NFL mandated that during field goals or extra point attempts, defenders must line up with their entire bodies on the outside of the snapper's body to protect the snapper while he is in a position of vulnerability. Violations of this rule, however, result in only a five-yard penalty for illegal formation.<ref name="Thomas 425–452"/>

The Competition Committee reviews all competitive aspects of the game, including playing rules, roster regulations, technology, game-day operations and player protection. The process for modifying or adopting rules and regulations is systematic and consensus-oriented.<ref>playsmartplaysafe.com Coaching For Change:Rule Changes Designed to Improve Health and Safety. website.</ref>

To reinforce the seriousness of the rule changes, in the middle of the 2010 season, Commissioner Goodell issued a memo to all NFL teams stating that "more significant discipline, including suspensions, will be imposed on players that strike an opponent in the head or neck area in violation of the rules."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/09000d5d81b7b9ef/article/goodell-issues-memo-enforcing-player-safety-rules|title=Goodell issues memo enforcing player safety rules|publisher=[[National Football League]]|date=2012-07-26|access-date=2014-11-11}}</ref>

The most drastic step the NFL has taken to reduce head injuries was the 2010 change to the NFL kickoff rules. To reduce what has been referred to as one of the most violent plays in the game, the kickoff was moved up from the 30-yard line to the 35-yard line. The NFL also outlawed the use of the three-man wedge on kickoffs, while allowing the two-man wedge to remain a legal play. Consequently, players on the kicking team must now line up closer to midfield, reducing the amount of space the players have in which to get a running start.<ref name="Thomas 425–452"/>

In 2011, the NFL also mandated that certified athletic trainers be available in press boxes during all NFL games. These athletic trainers assist medical personnel located on the sidelines in identifying potential concussions because the symptoms are often difficult to spot and assess from the field level.<ref name="Thomas 425–452"/>

On March 20, 2013, the NFL voted to introduce yet another new rule aimed at player safety. Starting in the 2013–2014 season, if a running back lowers the crown of his helmet while he is inside the tackle box or while he is less than three yards downfield and makes contact with a defender, the team will be given a 15-yard penalty.<ref name="Thomas 425–452"/>

After three years of declines in reported cases, the 2015 regular season contained a spike in reported concussions even after making several safety improvements the previous year. The total cases reported for the practices, pre-season, and regular season was 271, a 31.6 percent spike. The 2015 cases reported for regular season games was 182, a 58.3 percent spike.<ref>Shpigel, Ben. (29 January 2016). Diagnoses of Concussions Increase by Nearly a Third Over Last Season.

In the 2016 offseason, the NFL implemented a new policy to their concussion protocol. The NFL can now punish teams that do not follow their concussion protocol by imposing a monetary fine or taking away their draft picks. The first violation can be a fine up to $150,000 and the second violation can be a fine no less than $100,000 and a possible removal of draft picks.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.si.com/nfl/nfl-concussion-protocol-policy-history|title=What is the NFL's concussion protocol?|website=si.com|date=16 September 2016 }}</ref> In 2017, the Seattle Seahawks were under much scrutiny for violating the NFL's concussion protocol by allowing [[Russell Wilson]] to return to the game against the Arizona Cardinals without the proper treatment.

===WFA===
The [[Women's Football Alliance]] has come a long way when it comes to the guidelines on making the game safer for its players.

From 2012 to 2017 they have since made it illegal to send a player back into the game with suspicions of a concussion unless cleared by a certified health official.

===Youth football===
Return to play guidelines (RTPs), such as Washington State's Lystedt Law, have been legally mandated since 2009.  All 50 states, and Washington, D.C., have now passed legislation to help reduce the number of traumatic brain injuries in youth football.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bachynski|first1=Kathleen|title=Youth Sports & Public Health: Framing Risks of Mild Traumatic Brain Injury in American Football and Ice Hockey|journal=Journal of Law, Medicine and Ethics|year=2014|volume=42|issue=3|pages=323–33|doi=10.1111/jlme.12149|pmid=25264090|s2cid=39629829}}</ref>

Senator [[Dick Durbin]], from Illinois, introduced the Protecting Student Athletes from Concussions Act on September 25, 2013, to the U.S. Senate.  This act would require athletes, parents, coaches and school officials to be informed of the risks of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) and it would also require the "when in doubt, sit it out" policy to be used with athletes that have been suspected of having a concussion and be removed from the field of play.  A press release from Senator Durbin stated that many major U.S. sports organizations, including the NFL and NHL, endorsed the bill.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bachynski|first1=Kathleen|title=Youth Sports & Public Health: Framing Risks of Mild Traumatic Brain Injury in American Football and Ice Hockey|journal=Journal of Law, Medicine & Ethics|year=2014|volume=42|issue=Fall 2014|page=325|doi=10.1111/jlme.12149|pmid=25264090|s2cid=39629829}}</ref>

==Screening procedure==
{{Dubious|1=Screening procedures|reason= NPOV, dubious, hyperbole, promotional, FDA smackdown|date=April 2015}}

In September 2015, researchers with the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Department of Veterans Affairs]] and [[Boston University]] announced that they had identified CTE in 96 percent of NFL players that they had examined and in 79 percent of all football players.<ref>{{cite web|last=Breslow|first=Jason|title=New: 87 Deceased NFL Players Test Positive for Brain Disease|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/new-87-deceased-nfl-players-test-positive-for-brain-disease/|access-date=9 January 2016|publisher=Frontline}}</ref>

As of February 2015, Gary Small and colleagues have been called into question by the [[FDA]] for their overzealous commercialization and promotion of clinically unproven screening that fellow peer researchers deem fit only for research and they have responded by withdrawing related materials from their website.<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.latimes.com/science/sciencenow/la-sci-sn-brain-scan-warning-taumark-20150410-story.html|title= FDA forces UCLA researchers to stop touting experimental dementia scan|first= Alan |last= Zarembo|date= Apr 10, 2015|newspaper= LA Times}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|date= Feb 15, 2015|url= https://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/EnforcementActivitiesbyFDA/WarningLettersandNoticeofViolationLetterstoPharmaceuticalCompanies/UCM436520.pdf|title= Warning Letters and Notice of Violation Letters|publisher= FDA|quote= Restrict promotional claims of safety or effectiveness of the drug for a use for which it is under investigation and to preclude commercialization of the drug before it is approved for commercial distribution}}</ref>

To date, all screening procedures that examine football players for brain damage have been post mortem. In 2013, Gary Small and colleagues developed an in vivo chemical tracer that can detect tau protein build up in living players. Small and his team invented this new chemical tracer, 2-(1-<nowiki/>{6-[(2-[F-18]fluoroethyl)(methyl)amino]-2-naphthyl}ethylidene)malononitrile, or FDDNP, that could be used in [[Positron Emission Tomography]] (PET) scans.<ref name="Small 2013 138-144">{{cite journal|last=Small|first=G.W.|title=PET Scanning of Brain Tau in Retired National League Football Players: Preliminary Findings|journal=The American Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry |year=2013|volume=21|issue=2|pages=138–144|doi=10.1016/j.jagp.2012.11.019|pmid=23343487|citeseerx=10.1.1.372.2960}}</ref> This new tracer measures for tau protein and amyloid plaque accumulation in human brains; symptoms of repetitive brain trauma among other things. Although tracers have been developed to screen for the build-up of tau proteins in the human brain, FDDNP is the first PET tracer that can be used in vivo in human trials. FDDNP was originally developed in an effort to detect Alzheimer's in elderly individuals, thus the article was published in the [[The American Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry|journal]] of the [[American Association for Geriatric Psychiatry]]. However, because there are similarities between Alzheimer's and the effects of [[Chronic traumatic encephalopathy|Chronic Traumatic Encephelopathy]] (CTE), FDDNP was used to study the extent of brain trauma in consenting, retired NFL players.

Small and colleagues performed a controlled experiment on retired NFL players and an equal number of control participants. Unfortunately the sample size was very small as only 5 players of the 19 contacted were eligible for the study. Though the sample size was small, a good range of positions were represented (linebacker, quarterback, offensive lineman, defensive lineman, and a center) and all players had played in the league at least 10 years. The players had to be at least 45 years of age and currently exhibit symptoms of cognitive and mood disruption. Control participants had to meet certain criteria as well to ensure that they were as similar as possible to the NFL players in order to eliminate any biases or confounding variables. Age, Body Mass Index (BMI), years of education, and family history of dementia were all selected as the selection criteria for control participants. All participants received intravenous injections of the FDDNP tracer and were tested over 4 weeks using PET imaging technology.

The injection of the FDDNP tracer was successful, and the results of the study showed significant differences between the NFL players and control participants. The NFL players had significantly higher FDDNP signals than control participants, indicating a greater amount of tau protein accumulation. The cortical regions of all the participants studied showed no significant difference, but the NFL players had FDDNP levels that were significantly higher in the caudate, putamen, thalamus, sub thalamus, midbrain, and cerebellar white matter regions of the brain as compared to the control participants.<ref name="Small 2013 138-144"/> In addition, a positive correlation was found between the number of head injuries the players sustained and the levels of FDDNP binding. This suggests that players with a more severe history of head trauma will likely have significantly more accumulation of tau protein. This, in turn, gives rise to the suggestion that a more severe history of head trauma will result in greater deterioration of the brain, cognitive functioning, and mood regulation.

The findings of the study were consistent with previous autopsy studies of individuals with CTE. The important distinction to make, however, is that the patients in Small's study were not on the slab and walked out after testing was completed. This is monumental in the field of brain trauma and concussion research.

Based on recent new blood tests; evidence is revealing no change in blood plasma tau and serum neurofilament light concentrations following sport related concussions. However these levels did rise in more severe concussion sport related injuries. This can potentially suggest that a new blood test be developed and help aid in identifying the severity of concussion, and assist in concussion protocols.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=November 2018|title=New Biomarkers Study Results Reported from University of British Columbia (No change in plasma tau and serum concentrations in adolescent athletes following sport-related concussions).|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/anonymous?id=GALE%7CA561840507|journal=Obesity, Fitness & Wellness}}</ref>

==Recovery efforts==
Concussions are proven to cause loss of brain function. This can lead to physical and emotional symptoms such as attention disorders, depression, headaches, nausea, and amnesia. These symptoms can last for days or weeks and even after the symptoms have gone, the brain still will not be completely normal. Players with multiple concussions can have drastically worsened symptoms and exponentially increased recovery time.

Researchers at UCLA used a brain-imaging tool to identify a certain protein found in five retired NFL players. The presence and accumulation of tau proteins found in the five living players, are associated with [[Alzheimer's disease]]. Previously, this type of exam could only be performed with an autopsy. Scientists at UCLA created a chemical marker that binds to the abnormal proteins and they are able to view this with [[positron emission tomography]] (PET) scan. Researcher at UCLA, Gary Small explains, "Providing a non-invasive method for early detection is a critical first step in developing interventions to prevent symptom onset and progression in [[Chronic traumatic encephalopathy|CTE]]".<ref>{{cite web|title=First Imaging Study of Concussion-Related Abnormal Brain Proteins In Retired NFL Players|url=http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/releases/255241.php|publisher=Medical News Today|access-date=1 December 2013}}</ref>

[[Post-concussive symptoms]] (PCS) is an area of recovery that is often not discussed. New evidence suggest that new recovery protocols have been recommended and designed to more adequately and efficiently recover from concussions. PCS is a concussion symptom lasting longer than 14 days. Current protocols suggest that the athlete refrain from any physical activity until symptoms free. However, according to the Journal of Athletic Training "a physiological approach to prolonged recovery from sport-related concussion" suggests some aerobic activity may be beneficial to more appropriate healing from concussion, and may lessen the reoccurrence of repeated concussions.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Leddy|first=John|date=March 2017|title=A physiological approach to prolonged recovery from sport-related concussion|journal=Journal of Athletic Training|volume=52|issue=3|pages=299–308|doi=10.4085/1062-6050-51.11.08|pmc=5384826|pmid=28387557}}</ref>

There has been promising evidence that blood flow restriction based exercises can be used to improve Post-Concussion Syndrome (PCS). "The leading theory supporting this is that human growth hormone is released in response to increased lactate production from exercise, enhancing the brain function and recovery". This exercise based program could potentially be used in conjunction with aerobic therapy to better improve concussion symptoms during the recovery process.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Wu, Yi-Ning |title=Stable recovery after aerobic exercise with limb blood flow restriction and cooling in individuals with post-concussion syndrome |journal=Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America|pages=437–54|date= 2016}}</ref>

As of 2011, all 32 NFL teams are required to have at least one Physical Therapist on staff. Physical Therapist can help with current and former NFL players that have experienced a concussion. A Vestibular Physical Therapist can create customized treatment for dizziness and balance dysfunction associated with a concussion.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/anonymous?id=GALE%7CA317901881|title=Concussion management in football: don't shake it off: the effects of sports-related concussions can last for decades. physical therapists can play an important role in concussion detection and intervention|last=Boriboon|first=Kia|date=February 2013|website=Academic One File}}</ref>
