D-orbit is mainly active in the [[Space tug]] also known as orbital transfer vehicle (OTV) market. While this concept has existed for several decades, it is only in the last few years that more examples are being produced and used.<ref name=Spacenews15622 />

D-Orbit has been operating commercial ION missions since September 2020,<ref name=Spacenews15622 /> deploying satellites for customers like [[Planet Labs]],<ref name=SpaceNewsVega>{{Cite news |title=D-Orbit Satellite Carrier delivers Planet SuperDoves to desired orbits |work=SpaceNews.com |url=https://spacenews.com/d-orbit-demonstrates-ion/ |date=28 October 2020}}</ref> [[EnduroSat]], [[Elecnor Deimos]],<ref name=spacenews1621>{{Cite news |title=D-Orbit unveils third mission for ION Satellite Carrier |work=Space News |url=https://spacenews.com/d-orbit-wild-ride/ |date=1 June 2021}}</ref> [[University of Southern California]],<ref>{{Cite web |title=StackPath |url=https://www.militaryaerospace.com/commercial-aerospace/article/14234003/usc-la-jument-3u-cubesat |access-date=2022-03-15 |website=www.militaryaerospace.com}}</ref> [[SatRevolution]],<ref>{{Cite web |date=13 January 2022 |title=SpaceX Launches 105 Spacecraft in Transporter-3 Rideshare Mission – Via Satellite – |url=https://www.satellitetoday.com/launch/2022/01/13/spacex-launches-105-spacecraft-in-transporter-3-rideshare-mission/ |access-date=2022-03-16 |website=Via Satellite |language=en}}</ref> and [[Kleos Space|Kleos]],<ref>{{Cite web |last=Urban |first=Viktoria |date=2 March 2022 |title=Kleos Patrol mission to launch with D-Orbit's ION Satellite Carrier |url=https://spacewatch.global/2022/03/kleos-patrol-mission-to-launch-with-d-orbits-ion-satellite-carrier/ |access-date=2022-03-16 |website=SpaceWatch.Global |language=en-US}}</ref> and operating payloads for the German HPS, High Performance Space Structure Systems,<ref name=SatNews16322>{{Cite web |title=D-Orbit's Coming Up With A WILD RIDE Via Their ION Satellite Carrier – SatNews |url=https://news.satnews.com/2021/05/31/d-orbits-coming-up-with-a-wild-ride-via-their-ion-satellite-carrier/ |access-date=2022-03-16 |website=news.satnews.com}}</ref> the [[Instituto de Astrofísica de Canarias]] (IAC),<ref>{{Cite web |title=D-Orbit e IAC Instituto Astrofisica de Canarias insieme nella missione PULSE |url=https://www.affaritaliani.it/blog/imprese-professioni/d-orbit-iac-instituto-astrofisica-de-canarias-insieme-nella-missione-pulse-709351.html |access-date=2022-03-16 |website=Affaritaliani.it |language=it}}</ref> and the Swiss data security company Cysec SA.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Kriening |first=Torsten |date=6 July 2021 |title=CYSEC launches ARCA Space in December on D-Orbit's ION |url=https://spacewatch.global/2021/07/cysec-launches-arca-space-in-december-on-d-orbits-ion/ |access-date=2022-03-16 |website=SpaceWatch.Global |language=en-US}}</ref>

== History ==
[[File:Artistic_rendition_of_ION_Satellite_Carrier_while_deploying_a_satellite.png|left|thumb|Artistic rendition of ION Satellite Carrier while deploying a satellite.]]
D-Orbit was founded in 2011 by Luca Rossettini, currently serving as [[Chief executive officer|chief executive officer (CEO)]], and Renato Panesi, currently serving as [[Chief commercial officer|chief commercial officer (COO)]].<ref name=":3">{{Cite web |title=Interview with Renato Panesi, Chief Commercial Officer and Founder of D-Orbit, a space logistics company headquartered in Italy |url=https://scaleupitaly.com/interview-with-renato-panesi-d-orbit/ |website=Scale Up Italy|date=26 April 2021 }}</ref>

The company's initial focus was the development of a smart and autonomous decommissioning motor for satellites and launcher stages called D3 (D-Orbit Decommissioning Device).<ref name=":2">{{Cite web |title=Smart propulsive device for controlled satellite decommissioning and reentry. |url=https://cordis.europa.eu/article/id/240913-new-device-enables-satellites-to-decommission-themselves |website=European Commission}}</ref> In 2015, the D3 project was partially funded by the [[European Union]] under the framework of [[Horizon 2020]].<ref name=":2" />

This provided the origin of the D-orbit name, being just a contraction of the term "[[de-orbit]]", which denotes an orbital manoeuver that pulls a spacecraft out of its operational orbit and inserts it into a reentry trajectory that will eventually cause it to burn up upon atmospheric entry.<ref name=":2" />

In 2017, the company began the development of [[ION Satellite Carrier]], an [[Space tug|orbital transfer vehicle]] able to host a batch of satellites, transport them across orbits, and release each one of them, individually, into a custom orbital slot<ref>{{Cite web |title=SatMagazine |url=http://www.satmagazine.com/story.php?number=1514329154 |access-date=2022-03-16 |website=www.satmagazine.com}}</ref> and operate third-party payloads.<ref>{{Cite web |title=D-Orbit Launch and Deployment Services/Space Logistics Company |url=https://directory.eoportal.org/web/eoportal/satellite-missions/d/d-orbit |website=ESA Earth Observation Portal (eoPortal)}}</ref>
The [[Space tug|OTV]] performed its first commercial mission in September 2020.<ref>{{Cite web |date=9 September 2020 |title=D-Orbit launches its first ION Satellite Carrier |url=https://www.geospatialworld.net/news/d-orbit-launches-its-first-ion-satellite-carrier/ |access-date=2022-03-16 |website=Geospatial World |language=en-US}}</ref>

In 2022, the company planned to go public via a SPAC with a valuation of $1.4bn,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/27/italian-space-company-d-orbit-going-public-via-nasdaq-spac.html |title=Italian space company D-Orbit to go public via SPAC at a $1.4 billion valuation |date=27 January 2022 |publisher=CNBC}}</ref> however this was cancelled.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://spacenews.com/d-orbit-cancels-spac-merger-plan/ |title=D-Orbit cancels SPAC merger plan |date=15 August 2022 |publisher=SpaceNews.com}}</ref>

The initial plan was to create a product to deorbit satellites at the end of their life. However the company has moved on to [[space tugs]] also known as 'orbital transfer vehicles' (OTV). D-orbit developed the [[ION Satellite Carrier]] formerly known as 'ION CubeSat Carrier'. The company aims to address the space logistics needs of customers by reducing the time needed to transfer a single [[spacecraft]] or a batch of [[satellite]]s belonging to a [[Satellite constellation|constellation]] from a [[parking orbit]] to their designated operational slot.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |title=The future of the CubeSat launch technology |url=http://www.satmagazine.com/story.php?number=1514329154 |date=March 2019 |access-date=5 January 2022 |website=www.satmagazine.com}}</ref> The company's core solution is D-Orbit's proprietary launch and deployment [[orbital transfer vehicle]] (OTV) [[ION Satellite Carrier]] to perform [[Last mile (transportation)|last-mile]] delivery of the customer's satellites.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=Spacenews15622 /> D-Orbit's OTV is also able to perform in-orbit demonstration (IOD) of third-party payloads hosted onboard thanks to a plug-and-play mechanical, electrical, and data interface that streamlines integration and in-orbit operations.<ref>{{Cite web |title=D-Orbit Launch and Deployment Services/Space Logistics Company |url=https://directory.eoportal.org/web/eoportal/satellite-missions/d/d-orbit |website=The ESA Earth Observation Portal (eoPortal)}}</ref>

=== Main product: ION Satellite Carrier ===
[[ION Satellite Carrier]] is a [[satellite]] platform with a configurable payload bay that can be equipped with a combination of proprietary or third-party launch dispensers,  third-party payloads, [[Microsatellite (spaceflight)|microsatellites]],  and instruments like [[lens]]es and [[Antenna (radio)|antennas]] to be tested in orbit.

Through the course of a mission, ION Satellite Carrier can travel across orbits characterized by different orientation, altitude, and [[Longitude of the ascending node|local time of ascending node (LTAN)]],<ref name=":4" /> deploy the satellites on board into custom, individual orbital slots<ref name=":0" /> and perform experiments on hosted payloads in the designated operating envelope.<ref>{{Cite web |title=D-Orbit Launch and Deployment Services/Space Logistics Company |url=https://directory.eoportal.org/web/eoportal/satellite-missions/d/d-orbit |website=ESA Earth Observation Portal (eoPortal)}}</ref>
