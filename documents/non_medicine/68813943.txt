{{Short description|Congenital disease}}
'''Strophosomia''' is a severe form of congenital ventral fissure, all abdominal and thoracic viscera being free in the uterus.

It is an extreme case of [[celosomia]].

== In humans ==
It is a very rare [[dysmorphic feature]] in humans.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/strophosomia|title = Strophosomia}}</ref>

== In farm animals ==
The condition occurs regularly in [[Calf (animal)|calves]] and [[sheep|lambs]]. The spine is flexed 180° so that the caudal region is near the neck, in so-called ''Schizosoma reflexum''.<ref><!--please give the right formula to this reference-->R(oger) Hanset, ''Cours de [[teratology|tératologie]] (vétérinaire)'', student-made edition, University of Liège, undated (circa 1970); the author often refers to [[Isidore Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]].</ref>

During the [[veterinary obstetrics|obstetrical operations]], the viscera are reached first, but the four limbs fold backwards may be barely accessible.

[[Cesarian section]] is often required in [[cow]]s. [[Fetotomy]] can resolve the condition in [[sheep|ewes]].
