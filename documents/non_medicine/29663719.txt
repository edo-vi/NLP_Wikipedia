[[Taiwanese people|Taiwanese]] [[taekwondo]] [[sportsperson|athlete]] [[Yang Shu-chun]] was disqualified with twelve seconds remaining in the first round due to "unauthorized" (disputed) sensors on her [[sock]]s.

==The judgment==
Yang was facing [[Vietnam]]ese opponent Vu Thi Hau in the first round of the [[flyweight]] division (under 49 kilogram) of the Asian Games taekwondo competition in [[Guangzhou]], [[Guangdong]], [[People's Republic of China|China]] on November 17, 2010, when she was accused of using the "unauthorized" sensors. During the pre-match testing of equipment, the referee discovered that Yang had two extra sensors on the heels of each sock, which she was asked to remove. She fought without the two additional sensors on her socks.

However, with twelve seconds remaining in the first round of the bout, when Yang was leading at an advantage of 9–0, [[Asian Taekwondo Union]] vice-president Zhao Lei ({{lang|zh-cn|赵磊}}) of [[China]] instructed Filipino referee Fernandez S. Estanislaoto<ref>[http://www.gz2010.cn/info/ENG_ENG/ZB/ZBB101A_TK@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@ENG_number=101835.html FERNANDEZ Stephen Estanislao – Biography]</ref> to call Yang over to the side and inspected her heels. Finding nothing, the referee then called for the match referee to bring over the two sensors that had already been removed and kept under the chair that Yang's coach was sitting on. Following that, Zhao and the referee had a brief discussion, and the match referee disqualified Yang and awarded Vu a 12–0 victory.<ref name="taipeitimes1">{{cite news|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2010/11/19/2003488876|title=SOCKGATE: Public cries foul in Games row|publisher=The Taipei Times|date=November 19, 2010|access-date=November 21, 2010|archive-date=September 4, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230904120716/https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2010/11/19/2003488876|url-status=live}}</ref>

==The controversy==
[[Chinese Taipei]] representatives at the taekwondo venue immediately pointed out that the equipment was certified and that both fighters passed a pre-match inspection. Following the disqualification, Yang and her coach both protested on the mat for about an hour. The [[World Taekwondo Federation]] (WTF) authorities then gave the ultimatum for them to leave, or they would suspend every Chinese Taipei taekwondo member in the Game. The WTF Secretary-General Yang Jin-suk initially did not reveal the reason why Yang was disqualified and told the press that it was for the protection of the athlete's personal privacy, but later it was revealed the reason was for the sensors on her socks. Secretary-General later said, "It was clearly a manipulative move with the intent of cheating, and that's the reason why the individual was disqualified."<ref name="violation">{{cite web|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2010/11/19/2003488877/1|title=SOCKGATE:World taekwondo official insists Yang broke rules|publisher=The Taipei Times|date=November 19, 2010|access-date=November 21, 2010|archive-date=September 4, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230904120718/https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2010/11/19/2003488877|url-status=live}}</ref>

According to the Secretary-General of the WTF, there are two sorts of sensor socks for taekwondo. It is specified that only the newer type is allowed to be used in the 2010 Asian Games, because the older type of sensors are fixed by [[velcro]], which allows athletes to easily add new sensors themselves.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://2010.163.com/10/1118/08/6LOP5MBE00864IPP.html|script-title=zh:世界跆拳道联合会秘书长:杨淑君赛前已遭到警告|language=zh|publisher=[[NetEase]]|date=November 18, 2010|access-date=November 26, 2010|archive-date=November 20, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101120050645/http://2010.163.com/10/1118/08/6LOP5MBE00864IPP.html|url-status=dead}}</ref> The sensors on the newer type are fixed by stitching and have no possibility to be altered by illegal methods, but the newer type have no sensors on the heel.

Yang's coach, Liu Tsung-da ({{lang|zh-tw|劉聰達}}), said the inspector for the match asked Yang to change her socks due to poor signal response before the match. Yang put on another set of older velcro socks and passed the equipment inspection. During the match, the sensors on the heel area had already been removed, which should not affect the scoring record. Right after the judgment, Liu asked for the testimony of the inspector and the surveillance video as evidence, but the demands were all rejected.<ref>{{cite news|author=馬鈺龍、陳東旭|url=http://udn.com/NEWS/NATIONAL/NAT2/5985555.shtml|script-title=zh:偷貼有錄影？ 楊淑君：拿出來|publisher=United Daily News Net|date=2010-11-20|access-date=2010-11-26|language=zh|archive-date=2010-11-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101121232032/http://udn.com/NEWS/NATIONAL/NAT2/5985555.shtml|url-status=live}}</ref>

The equipment supplier of the Chinese Taipei team said they had never received an official notification from the WTF about suspending the velcro type socks before the Asian Games. There were many of the older type being used in other matches of different weight classes, but those athletes didn't suffer any punishment before or after their matches. According to the WTF official instruction for taekwondo athletes, the former type is still legal in any international games until [[2012 Summer Olympics|London Olympics in 2012]].<ref>{{cite news|author=丁泰翔|url=http://tvbstv.com/news/news_list.asp?no=chen198720101119191153|script-title=zh:「楊淑君沒貼錯」　廠商示電子襪說明書|publisher=[[TVBS]]|date=2010-11-20|access-date=2010-11-26|language=zh|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717114545/http://tvbstv.com/news/news_list.asp?no=chen198720101119191153|archive-date=2011-07-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=E-Apple|url=http://tw.nextmedia.com/rnews/article/ArtID/91402/IssueID/20101118/SecID/107|script-title=zh:廣州亞運》貼的位置不對！楊淑君失格確定|publisher=[[Apple Daily (Taiwan)|Apple Daily]]|date=2010-11-18|access-date=2010-11-26|language=zh|archive-date=2010-11-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101121043824/http://tw.nextmedia.com/rnews/article/ArtID/91402/IssueID/20101118/SecID/107|url-status=live}}</ref> The two "unauthorized" extra sensors proclaimed to be found by the Game officials belong to the original design of the older type by a Korean equipment manufacturer, which is the only manufacturer authorized by the WTF officials for the 2010 Asian Games.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.budomart.com.tw/img/20101120q0120555.jpg|title=經緯武道之聲明稿 (The declaration from the equipment supplier)|publisher=經緯武道館|access-date=2010-11-26|archive-date=2023-09-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230904120715/https://www.budomart.com.tw/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=黃邱倫|url=http://news.chinatimes.com/focus/0,5243,50107297x112010112100117,00.html|script-title=zh:賽事主任 曹濤：領隊會議未提禁用貼片|publisher=[[China Times]]|date=2010-11-21|access-date=2010-11-26|language=zh|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101124025614/http://news.chinatimes.com/focus/0%2C5243%2C50107297x112010112100117%2C00.html|archive-date=2010-11-24}}</ref>

==Political reaction==
Political reaction in the Republic of China (Taiwan) came swiftly, with politicians on both sides of the political spectrum rushing to Yang's defense. The [[Kuomintang]] [[Legislative Yuan|legislator]] [[Huang Chih-hsiung]] ({{lang|zh-hant|黃志雄}}), himself an [[Taekwondo at the 2004 Summer Olympics|Olympic taekwondo silver medalist]] at the [[2004 Athens Olympic Games]], stated "the decision was inconceivable and ridiculous." [[Premier of the Republic of China|Premier]] [[Wu Den-yih]] ({{lang|zh-hant|吳敦義}}) is cited as saying, "From the current information we have, our athlete Yang Shu-chun was wronged. If it is proven that the ruling was unfair, the Asian Games Organizing Committee has to shoulder the biggest responsibility." The [[Sports Affairs Council]] demanded an explanation from the [[Asian Taekwondo Union]] regarding the disqualification.

The [[Democratic Progressive Party]] (DPP) legislator Pan Men-an ({{lang|zh-hant|潘孟安}}) claimed at a press conference that the accusation by the Game officials that Yang had cheated was an "insult to everybody around the country," and charged that, "the responsibility should fall on the people that conducted the equipment checks."<ref name="taipeitimes1"/>

However, not all was completely peaceful between the two political sides, as the DPP leaders accused the government of a slow response. The DPP Legislator Chiu Yi-ying ({{lang|zh-hant|邱議瑩}}) complained that: "A large number of officials attended the Games, but all they have done so far is to show up at and take part in the awarding ceremonies when our athletes win. When Yang was disqualified, what did they do? Nothing."

[[Tsai Ing-wen]] ({{lang|zh-hant|蔡英文}}), then-current [[chairperson]] of the DPP and [[2010 Republic of China municipal elections|a candidate for mayor]] of [[New Taipei City]] in 2010, released a statement saying: "This government has always deferred to China and hasn't emphasized our attitudes enough, especially on [[Sovereignty of Taiwan|sovereignty issues]]." She further stated, "As a result, we think that it is regrettable that frontline officials haven't been protesting strongly enough about this incident."

==Public reaction==
Shortly after the disqualification, Taiwanese [[netizen]]s voiced their dissatisfaction with the judgment. Soon, several [[Facebook group]]s in support of Yang were posted, some with hundreds of thousands of followers. On the pages, outcry toward both [[South Korea]] and [[People's Republic of China|China]] was rampant, with many conjecturing a conspiracy, as Yang was regarded as the primary rival to China's gold medal favorite, [[Wu Jingyu]] ({{lang|zh-hans|吴静钰}}), the eventual winner of the gold.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2010/11/19/2003488919|title=SOCKGATE: Netizens voice rage at Games|publisher=Taipei Times|date=November 19, 2010|access-date=November 21, 2010|archive-date=September 4, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230904120803/https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2010/11/19/2003488919|url-status=live}}</ref> The conspiracy theorized that Zhao Le ({{lang|zh-hans|赵磊}}), Wu Jingyu's long-time mentor, was the invisible hand that deliberately forced Yang's ouster to pave the way for Wu's gold medal.

The [[Taekwondo at the 2006 Asian Games|2006 Asian Games]] gold medalist [[Su Li-wen]] ({{lang|zh-hant|蘇麗文}}) came out in support of Yang in her blog, saying that she has never heard of such a ridiculous accusation and pointed out that eight of Yang's nine points were manually scored without the benefit of the foot sensors.<ref>{{cite news|author=Cheng Yu-chia|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2010/11/19/2003488922|title=SOCKGATE: Former champion comes out in support of Yang|publisher=[[Taipei Times]]|date=2010-11-19|access-date=2010-11-26|archive-date=2023-09-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230904120722/https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2010/11/19/2003488922|url-status=live}}</ref>

Yang's father, Yang Chin-hsing ({{lang|zh-hant|楊進興}}), remarked, "The whole thing is utterly unacceptable", and told the press that Yang had spent ten months preparing for this competition and that he suspected that China was behind this incident.<ref>{{cite news|author=Tsai Wei-chi|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2010/11/19/2003488920|title=SOCKGATE: Athlete's father demands justice after disqualification|publisher=[[Taipei Times]]|date=2010-11-19|access-date=2010-11-26|archive-date=2023-09-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230904120723/https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2010/11/19/2003488920|url-status=live}}</ref>

The Asian Taekwondo Union published a misleading article titled "Shocking Act of Deception by Chinese Taipei" on its website, attempting to deflect South Korea of blame of the incident. The homepage of the website was then hacked by Taiwanese [[Hacker (computer security)|hacker]]s who added hostile criticism. Later, the homepage was restored, and the misleading article was removed. The Union has reportedly blocked Taiwanese IPs from accessing its website.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nownews.com/2010/11/22/339-2666586.htm|language=zh|title=亞跆盟官網使賤招？ 用防火牆封鎖台灣 IP 騙說遭駭！ &#124; 3C新聞 &#124; NOWnews 今日新聞網|publisher=Nownews.com|access-date=2010-11-22|archive-date=2010-11-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101125152259/http://www.nownews.com/2010/11/22/339-2666586.htm|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Anti-Korean protests in Taiwan===

==Verdict==
On December 21, 2010, Yang was given a three months' suspension for protesting her disqualification during the 2010 Asian Games by the World Taekwondo Federation (WTF). Her coach, Liu Tsung-ta was given a 20 months' suspension while Chinese Taipei Taekwondo Association (CTTA) was fined US$50,000 for "negligence and wrongdoing".<ref>{{cite news|last=Wang|first=Chris|title=Taiwan taekwondo athlete Yang suspended for three months (update)|url=http://focustaiwan.tw/ShowNews/WebNews_Detail.aspx?Type=aALL&ID=201012210039|access-date=2010-12-22|newspaper=Focus Taiwan News Channel|date=2010-12-21|archive-date=2023-09-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230904121228/https://focustaiwan.tw/ShowNews/WebNews_Detail.aspx?Type=aALL&ID=201012210039|url-status=live}}</ref>
