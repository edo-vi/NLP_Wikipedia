[[File:Pigmy sweeper Parapriacanthus ransonneti (Steindachner 1870).jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The bioluminescent fish ''Parapriacanthus ransonneti'', which obtains its luciferase protein from its diet, rather than encoding it within its own genome]]

A '''kleptoprotein''' is a protein which is not encoded in the [[genome]] of the organism which uses it, but instead is obtained through diet from a prey organism. Importantly, a kleptoprotein must maintain its function and be mostly or entirely undigested, drawing a distinction from proteins that are digested for nutrition, which become destroyed and non-functional in the process.

This phenomenon was first reported in the bioluminescent fish ''[[Parapriacanthus]]'', which has specialized light organs adapted towards [[counter-illumination]], but obtains the [[luciferase]] enzyme within these organs from bioluminescent ostracods, including ''[[Cypridina noctiluca]]'' or ''[[Vargula hilgendorfii]]''.<ref name="Bessho-Uehara Yamamoto Shigenobu Mori 2020 p=eaax4942">{{cite journal | last1=Bessho-Uehara | first1=Manabu | last2=Yamamoto | first2=Naoyuki | last3=Shigenobu | first3=Shuji | last4=Mori | first4=Hitoshi | last5=Kuwata | first5=Keiko | last6=Oba | first6=Yuichi | title=Kleptoprotein bioluminescence: Parapriacanthus fish obtain luciferase from ostracod prey | journal=Science Advances | publisher=American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) | volume=6 | issue=2 | year=2020 | issn=2375-2548 | doi=10.1126/sciadv.aax4942 | page=eaax4942| pmid=31934625 | pmc=6949039 | bibcode=2020SciA....6.4942B | doi-access=free }}</ref>
