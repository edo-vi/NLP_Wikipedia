'''Finley Ellingwood''' was a doctor of [[eclectic medicine]] who is the author of the influential [[American Materia Medica]], therapeutics, and pharmacognosy in 1919. Ellingwood was an active Chicago physician with many years experience, and an acknowledged expert in [[Obstetrics|obstetrical]]/[[Gynaecology|gynecological]] medicine. He was a vocal advocate of women physicians, and edited ''Ellingwood's Therapeutist'' for many years. His brand of Eclectic Medicine differed from the more subdued Cincinnati style as mentored by Scudder, Lloyd, Fyfe, and Felter.<ref>[http://www.swsbm.com/Ellingwoods/Ellingwoods.html American Materia Medica, Therapeutics and Pharmacognosy-Ellingwood<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
 
The American Materia Medica, Therapeutics and [[Pharmacognosy]] is a serious medical text from the early 20th century, intended for practicing physicians and surgeons, which refers to difficult medical situations found in that period. There is an emphasis on physical diagnosis.  The book is organized by organ system affected instead of by herbal name, so it will have headings such as "agents acting on the [[nervous system]]" or "agents acting on the [[heart]]". This type of listing is somewhat controversial as [[herbal medicine]]s tend to work on more than one system.  The book had been substantially lost until it was scanned by herbalist [[Michael Moore (herbalist)|Michael Moore]] in pdf format.<ref>http://www.swsbm.com/Ellingwoods/Ellingwoods.html Michael Moore scanned version in pdf format</ref> The book is also available in [[HTML]] format at [[Henriette Kress]]'s website.<ref>http://www.henriettesherbal.com/eclectic/ellingwood  Henriette Kress version in html</ref>
