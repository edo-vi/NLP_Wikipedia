In a [[non-fiction]] [[book]], a '''conclusion''' is an ending section which states the concluding ideas and concepts of the preceding writing.  This generally follows the body or perhaps an [[afterword]], and the conclusion may be followed by an [[epilogue]], [[outro (book)|outro]], [[postscript]], appendix/[[Addendum#In books|addendum]], [[glossary]], [[bibliography]], [[index (publishing)|index]], [[erratum|errata]], or a [[colophon (publishing)|colophon]]. [[Aristotle]], in ''The Rhetoric'', tells us a good writer should do this in the conclusion: "make the audience well-disposed towards ourselves and ill-disposed to our opponent." It's a good opportunity to make inferences or predictions, or to ask the audience to consider what would happen if they do not accept our point of view by making a connection to society in general.
