==History==
[[Taichung]], Taiwan was selected to be the host city for the first East Asian Youth Games on October 24, 2014 during the 32nd East Asian Games Association Council Meeting in [[Beijing]], [[China]].<ref name="host"/> The [[Taichung City Government]] originally planned to establish a committee for the Games in December 2014,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sport.taichung.gov.tw/ct.asp?xItem=1468545&ctNode=22867&mp=104020|title=臺中申辦2019年東亞青運成功三部曲|last=朱克明|date=2015-06-17|website=www.sport.taichung.gov.tw|access-date=2016-12-18|archive-date=2016-12-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221012219/http://www.sport.taichung.gov.tw/ct.asp?xItem=1468545&ctNode=22867&mp=104020|url-status=dead}}</ref> but this was postponed until June 26, 2015, when the 2019 East Asian Youth Games Organization Committee (2019年東亞青年運動會籌備委員會) was set up.<ref name="籌委會成立">{{Cite web |url=http://www.peoplenews.tw/news/2a8d773d-a26a-46e4-8d0f-f680dae29bb9 |title=第一屆東亞青運籌委會正式揭牌 進入熱身起跑階段 |location=臺中 |publisher=民報 |date=2015-06-26}}</ref> This was to be the first time Taichung City had organised an international multi-sport event, as well as being the first East Asian Youth Games. On July 31, 2018, Taichung was stripped of hosting rights after a vote by the East Asian Olympic Committee.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.insidethegames.biz/articles/1068184/taiwan-stripped-of-2019-east-asian-youth-games-amid-dispute-with-china|title = Taiwan stripped of 2019 East Asian Youth Games amid dispute with China}}</ref> The cancellation was due to Chinese anger over public calls in Taiwan for a referendum on whether Taiwan should be allowed to compete under the name "Taiwan" at the [[2020 Summer Olympics]] and [[Taiwan independence movement|pro-independence campaign]], or should continue to compete under the name "[[Chinese Taipei]]", as it has been forced to acquiesce to since the 1970s.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2018/04/09/what-is-chinese-taipei |title= What is Chinese Taipei? |publisher= [[The Economist]] |date= April 9, 2018}}</ref>
