'''Vaccine therapy''' is a type of treatment that uses a substance or group of substances to stimulate the [[immune system]] to destroy a [[tumor]] or [[infection|infectious]] [[microorganisms]] such as [[bacteria]] or [[viruses]].

==Cancer vaccines==
Cancer is a group of fatal diseases that involves abnormal cell growth that can invade or spread to other parts of the body.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/understanding/what-is-cancer|title=What Is Cancer?|date=2007-09-17|website=National Cancer Institute|language=en|access-date=2019-04-15}}</ref> They are usually caused by the accumulation of mutations in genes that regulate cell growth and differentiation. Majority of cancer, about 90-95%, are due to genetic mutations from environmental and lifestyle factors – including age, chemicals, diet, exercise, viruses, and radiation. The remaining 5-10% are due to inherited genetics.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Anand P, Kunnumakkara AB, Kunnumakara AB, Sundaram C, Harikumar KB, Tharakan ST, Lai OS, Sung B, Aggarwal BB | title = Cancer is a preventable disease that requires major lifestyle changes | journal = Pharmaceutical Research | volume = 25 | issue = 9 | pages = 2097–116 | date = September 2008 | pmid = 18626751 | pmc = 2515569 | doi = 10.1007/s11095-008-9661-9 }}</ref> Some of the cancers may be difficult to treat by conventional means such as surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy, but may be controlled by the stimulation of the immune response of the body with the help of cancer vaccines.{{cn|date=March 2022}}

# Preventive or prophylactic vaccines
# Treatment or [[therapeutic vaccines]]
These vaccines are intended to treat existing cancer by stimulating the patient’s immune system.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Lollini PL, Cavallo F, Nanni P, Forni G | title = Vaccines for tumour prevention | journal = Nature Reviews. Cancer | volume = 6 | issue = 3 | pages = 204–16 | date = March 2006 | pmid = 16498443 | doi = 10.1038/nrc1815 | s2cid = 41804071 }}</ref>

Cancer vaccines can also divided into specific or universal cancer vaccine based on the types of cancer it is used for. Specific cancer vaccines are only used to treat a particular type of cancer while universal vaccine can be used to treat different types of cancer.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Evans WK, Shepherd FA, Feld R, Osoba D, Dang P, Deboer G | title = VP-16 and cisplatin as first-line therapy for small-cell lung cancer | journal = Journal of Clinical Oncology | volume = 3 | issue = 11 | pages = 1471–7 | date = November 1985 | pmid = 2997406 | doi = 10.1016/s0169-5002(86)80104-0 }}</ref>

===Protein/peptide-based vaccines===
* Tumor-associated antigens

Vaccines of this kind use specific tumor antigens, which are usually proteins or peptides, to stimulate immune system against either tumor specific antigens (TSAs) or tumor associated antigens (TAAs). This vaccine helps stimulate the patient's immune system to increase production of antibodies or killer T cells.<ref name=":0">{{cite journal | vauthors = Guo C, Manjili MH, Subjeck JR, Sarkar D, Fisher PB, Wang XY | title = Therapeutic cancer vaccines: past, present, and future | journal = Advances in Cancer Research | volume = 119 | pages = 421–75 | date = 2013 | pmid = 23870514 | pmc = 3721379 | doi = 10.1016/B978-0-12-407190-2.00007-1 }}</ref>

===Dendritic cell vaccines===
Dendritic cells (DCs) are considered the most potent APC (antigen presenting cell) of the immune system. DC cells have a unique  ability to stimulate naïve T cells and can be used to induce of antigen-specific immune response. Several DC-based cancer vaccines have been developed including DC loaded with, tumor peptides or whole proteins,<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Li Y, Bendandi M, Deng Y, Dunbar C, Munshi N, Jagannath S, Kwak LW, Lyerly HK | title = Tumor-specific recognition of human myeloma cells by idiotype-induced CD8(+) T cells | journal = Blood | volume = 96 | issue = 8 | pages = 2828–33 | date = October 2000 | doi = 10.1182/blood.V96.8.2828 | pmid = 11023518 }}</ref> with tumor-derived mRNA or DNA.,<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Van Tendeloo VF, Ponsaerts P, Lardon F, Nijs G, Lenjou M, Van Broeckhoven C, Van Bockstaele DR, Berneman ZN | title = Highly efficient gene delivery by mRNA electroporation in human hematopoietic cells: superiority to lipofection and passive pulsing of mRNA and to electroporation of plasmid cDNA for tumor antigen loading of dendritic cells | journal = Blood | volume = 98 | issue = 1 | pages = 49–56 | date = July 2001 | pmid = 11418462 | doi = 10.1182/blood.v98.1.49 | doi-access = free }}</ref> DC transduced with viral vectors such as retroviruses,<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ardeshna KM, Pizzey AR, Thomas NS, Orr S, Linch DC, Devereux S | title = Monocyte-derived dendritic cells do not proliferate and are not susceptible to retroviral transduction | journal = British Journal of Haematology | volume = 108 | issue = 4 | pages = 817–24 | date = March 2000 | pmid = 10792288 | doi = 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2000.01956.x | doi-access = free }}</ref> lentiviruses<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = He Y, Zhang J, Mi Z, Robbins P, Falo LD | title = Immunization with lentiviral vector-transduced dendritic cells induces strong and long-lasting T cell responses and therapeutic immunity | journal = Journal of Immunology | volume = 174 | issue = 6 | pages = 3808–17 | date = March 2005 | pmid = 15749922 | doi = 10.4049/jimmunol.174.6.3808 | doi-access = free }}</ref> adenoviruses,<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Di Nicola M, Carlo-Stella C, Milanesi M, Magni M, Longoni P, Mortarini R, Anichini A, Tomanin R, Scarpa M, Gianni AM | title = Large-scale feasibility of gene transduction into human CD34+ cell-derived dendritic cells by adenoviral/polycation complex | journal = British Journal of Haematology | volume = 111 | issue = 1 | pages = 344–50 | date = October 2000 | pmid = 11091223 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2000.02258.x | s2cid = 44393668 }}</ref> fowl pox<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kim CJ, Cormier J, Roden M, Gritz L, Mazzara GP, Fetsch P, Hijazi Y, Lee KH, Rosenberg SA, Marincola FM | title = Use of recombinant poxviruses to stimulate anti-melanoma T cell reactivity | journal = Annals of Surgical Oncology | volume = 5 | issue = 1 | pages = 64–76 | date = January 1998 | pmid = 9524710 | doi = 10.1007/bf02303766 | s2cid = 36897075 }}</ref> and alphaviruses containing the tumor antigen or gene of interest, whole necrotic or apoptotic tumor cells,<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Chen Z, Moyana T, Saxena A, Warrington R, Jia Z, Xiang J | title = Efficient antitumor immunity derived from maturation of dendritic cells that had phagocytosed apoptotic/necrotic tumor cells | journal = International Journal of Cancer | volume = 93 | issue = 4 | pages = 539–48 | date = August 2001 | pmid = 11477558 | doi = 10.1002/ijc.1365 | s2cid = 7012856 | doi-access = free }}</ref> tumor cell lysates<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ferlazzo G, Semino C, Spaggiari GM, Meta M, Mingari MC, Melioli G | title = Dendritic cells efficiently cross-prime HLA class I-restricted cytolytic T lymphocytes when pulsed with both apoptotic and necrotic cells but not with soluble cell-derived lysates | journal = International Immunology | volume = 12 | issue = 12 | pages = 1741–7 | date = December 2000 | pmid = 11099314 | doi = 10.1093/intimm/12.12.1741 | doi-access = free }}</ref> and DC-fused with tumor cells.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Avigan D, Rosenblatt J, Kufe D | title = Dendritic/tumor fusion cells as cancer vaccines | journal = Seminars in Oncology | volume = 39 | issue = 3 | pages = 287–95 | date = June 2012 | pmid = 22595051 | doi = 10.1053/j.seminoncol.2012.02.003 }}</ref>

===Whole tumor cell vaccines===
An advantage to using tumor cell vaccines is that this type of vaccine is polyepitope, which means it can present an entire spectrum of TAAs to a patient’s immune system.{{cn|date=July 2023}}
* Autologous tumor cell vaccines

These vaccines are made from antigens taken from the patient’s own cancer cells. Autologous vaccines have been used to treat lung cancer,<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Nemunaitis J, Nemunaitis J | title = Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor gene-transfected autologous tumor cell vaccine: focus[correction to fcous] on non-small-cell lung cancer | journal = Clinical Lung Cancer | volume = 5 | issue = 3 | pages = 148–57 | date = November 2003 | pmid = 14667270 | doi = 10.3816/clc.2003.n.027 }}</ref> colorectal cancer,<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = de Weger VA, Turksma AW, Voorham QJ, Euler Z, Bril H, van den Eertwegh AJ, Bloemena E, Pinedo HM, Vermorken JB, van Tinteren H, Meijer GA, Hooijberg E | title = Clinical effects of adjuvant active specific immunotherapy differ between patients with microsatellite-stable and microsatellite-instable colon cancer | journal = Clinical Cancer Research | volume = 18 | issue = 3 | pages = 882–9 | date = February 2012 | pmid = 22156611 | doi = 10.1158/1078-0432.ccr-11-1716 | doi-access = free }}</ref> melanoma,<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Méndez R, Ruiz-Cabello F, Rodríguez T, Del Campo A, Paschen A, Schadendorf D, Garrido F | title = Identification of different tumor escape mechanisms in several metastases from a melanoma patient undergoing immunotherapy | journal = Cancer Immunology, Immunotherapy | volume = 56 | issue = 1 | pages = 88–94 | date = January 2007 | pmid = 16622680 | doi = 10.1007/s00262-006-0166-2 | s2cid = 6401524 }}</ref> renal cell cancer,<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Fishman M, Hunter TB, Soliman H, Thompson P, Dunn M, Smilee R, Farmelo MJ, Noyes DR, Mahany JJ, Lee JH, Cantor A, Messina J, Seigne J, Pow-Sang J, Janssen W, Antonia SJ | title = Phase II trial of B7-1 (CD-86) transduced, cultured autologous tumor cell vaccine plus subcutaneous interleukin-2 for treatment of stage IV renal cell carcinoma | journal = Journal of Immunotherapy | volume = 31 | issue = 1 | pages = 72–80 | date = January 2008 | pmid = 18157014 | doi = 10.1097/cji.0b013e31815ba792 | s2cid = 42910390 }}</ref> and prostate cancer.<ref>{{Cite journal| vauthors = Berger M, Horst JL, Kreutz F, Pimentel M, Müller RL, Koff WJ |date= April 2006 | title = Phase I Study With an Immunomodulated Autologous Cell Vaccine for Locally Advanced Prostate Cancer |journal=European Urology Supplements |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=96 |doi=10.1016/s1569-9056(06)60300-x }}</ref>
* Allogenic tumor cell vaccines

These vaccines are made from antigens taken from individuals other than the patient, usually from cancer cell lines.<ref name=":0" />
