In [[animal breeding]], a '''breeding mount''' or '''phantom mount''' is an imitation of a female animal used to hold an [[artificial vagina]] for [[collecting semen]] from a male animal for use in [[artificial insemination]]. In use, the male animal is encouraged to [[animal sexual behaviour|mount]] the breeding mount as if he were copulating with a female. Breeding mounts are commonly used in conjunction with a real female of the same species nearby, to bring the male to full [[sexual arousal]] so that he is ready to mount the breeding mount. In the case of horses, this is known as the "tease mare".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vivo.colostate.edu/hbooks/pathphys/reprod/semeneval/stallion.html|title=Semen Collection from Stallions|accessdate=2011-11-30}}</ref>
