Artest immediately charged into the crowd and grabbed another fan, Michael Ryan, whom he mistakenly believed was the culprit. Several Pacer teammates followed, more drinks and punches were thrown, and the incident escalated into a large brawl that spread from the stands to the court and involved fans and players from both teams.

==Background ==
The [[Indiana Pacers]] and [[Detroit Pistons]] had not met since the [[2003–04 NBA season|previous season]]'s [[2004 NBA Playoffs#Conference Finals East: (1) Indiana Pacers vs. (3) Detroit Pistons|Eastern Conference Finals]], which the Pistons won in six games en route to their first [[2004 NBA Finals|NBA title]] since the [[Detroit Pistons#1986–1992: The Bad Boys|"Bad Boys" era]] of the late 1980s and early 1990s.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/NBA_2004.html|title=2004 NBA Playoff Summary|work=basketball-reference.com|publisher=Sports Reference LLC|access-date=September 29, 2008|archive-date=October 4, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081004035007/http://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/NBA_2004.html|url-status=live}}</ref> Coming off a two-game winning streak, the Pacers held a 6–2 record, while the defending champion Pistons had begun their season 4–3. The game was televised nationally on [[NBA on ESPN|ESPN]]<ref name="abrams20120229"/> along with both teams' local broadcast affiliates, [[Bally Sports Midwest|FSN Midwest]] and [[WDIV-TV|WDIV]] (Detroit's [[NBC]] affiliate).

The game, like many previous meetings between the two teams, was dominated by [[man-to-man defense|defense]]. The Pacers got off to a quick start, opening up a 20-point lead with seven minutes to go before [[half-time|halftime]]. The Pistons managed to cut into the lead, trailing by 16 points by halftime. The Pistons opened the third quarter with a 9–2 run, but the Pacers ended it with a buzzer-beating three-pointer and a [[layup]] from [[Jamaal Tinsley]] heading into the fourth quarter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/pacers/news/game_041119.html|title=Big Win Marred by Ugly Brawl|date=November 19, 2004|access-date=September 27, 2008|work=NBA.com|publisher=Turner Sports Interactive, Inc|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041121161745/http://www.nba.com/pacers/news/game_041119.html|archive-date=November 21, 2004|url-status=dead}}</ref>

[[Richard Hamilton (basketball)|Richard Hamilton]] and [[Lindsey Hunter]] started the last quarter with consecutive three-point [[field goal (basketball)|field goals]] as the Pistons cut into the lead again. But [[Stephen Jackson]]'s back-to-back field goals pushed the lead back to 93–79 with 3:52 remaining, essentially putting the Pistons away.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/pacers/news/game_041119.html|title=Big Win Marred by Ugly Brawl|date=November 19, 2004|access-date=September 27, 2008|work=NBA.com|publisher=Turner Sports Interactive, Inc|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041121161745/http://www.nba.com/pacers/news/game_041119.html|archive-date=November 21, 2004|url-status=dead}}</ref> Despite the lopsided score near the end of the game, most key players on both teams remained in the game.<ref name="recap">{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/recap?gameId=241119008|agency=Associated Press|title=Carlisle: 'I was fighting for my life out there'|date=November 19, 2004|work=ESPN.com|access-date=April 26, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041125092458/http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/recap?gameId=241119008|archive-date=November 25, 2004|url-status=live}}</ref>

The Pacers were led by the 24-point effort of [[small forward]] [[Metta Sandiford-Artest|Ron Artest]], who scored 17 in the first quarter.{{r|recap}} [[Jermaine O'Neal]] notched a [[Double (basketball)#Double-double|double-double]] with 20 points and 13 [[rebound (basketball)|rebounds]]. Tinsley had 13 points, eight [[Assist (basketball)|assists]] and a career-high eight [[steal (basketball)|steals]]. Hamilton led the Pistons with 20 points.

The brawl began with 45.9&nbsp;seconds remaining in the final quarter of the game, when the Pacers led 97–82. Pistons [[center (basketball)|center]] Ben Wallace was [[personal foul (basketball)|fouled]] from behind by Artest, who slapped him across the back of the head during a layup attempt. Wallace later said that Artest had warned him he would be hit.<ref name="abrams20120229"/> Wallace responded by shoving Artest in the face with both hands, causing players from both teams to quickly get in between them as they attempted to keep the two separated.<ref name="firstreport">{{cite web|url=https://www.espn.com/nba/news/story?id=1927380|title=Artest, Jackson charge Palace stands|date=November 21, 2004|work=ESPN.com|access-date=September 11, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041125090829/http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=1927380|archive-date=November 25, 2004|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name="knightridder">{{cite web|title=Foul play in Auburn Hills: Pacers in brawl with Palace fans |url=http://www.freep.com/sports/pistons/brawl20e_20041120.htm|work=Detroit Free Press|access-date=April 17, 2012|date=November 21, 2004|last=Elrick|first=M.

Pistons coach [[Larry Brown (basketball)|Larry Brown]] later said he was initially not concerned, because when altercations occur in NBA games, they usually last a few seconds. After breaking up the confrontation, [[referee]]s discussed fouls and [[ejection (sports)|ejections]] before the game resumed.{{r|abrams20120229}} Sportscaster [[Mike Breen]], calling the game for ESPN, believed Wallace would be ejected, while [[Bill Walton]] was of the opinion that Stephen Jackson should be ejected as well for shouting at the Pistons players and aggravating the situation. However, Breen expressed concern that, if Wallace got ejected, he would have to walk past the Pacers bench, which could have caused another incident.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwvihuoeI8A|title=YouTube|website=www.youtube.com|access-date=September 13, 2015|archive-date=June 14, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150614030532/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwvihuoeI8A|url-status=live}}</ref>

As the referees huddled to discuss penalties, Artest went to the scorer's table and lay down on it, putting on a headset to speak with Pacers radio broadcaster Mark Boyle, though the broadcast team did not activate his microphone. Boyle recalled that the broadcasting team knew Artest's personality and "there was no way we were going to put an open mic in front of Ron Artest in that situation". Pacers president [[Donnie Walsh]] later stated that Artest was following advice he had received on how to calm down and avoid trouble in a volatile situation.{{r|abrams20120229}}

Ninety seconds after Wallace shoved Artest, most of both teams' players and coaches were huddled at midcourt, attempting to calm down Wallace.{{r|abrams20120229}} [[Tayshaun Prince]] was the only player on either team to not leave the bench during the entire incident. Others became automatically eligible for one-game suspensions.<ref name="mccosky20041129">{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/basketball/nba/2004-11-20-detroit-fans_x.htm|title=Pistons-Pacers brawl spills into the stands|work=USA Today|date=November 20, 2004|access-date=March 1, 2012|author=McCosky, Chris|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140411211946/http://www.usatoday.com/sports/basketball/nba/2004-11-20-detroit-fans_x.htm|archive-date=April 11, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> While Artest was lying on the table, Wallace threw a towel at him, causing Artest to briefly stand up before being held back by coaches.{{r|abrams20120229}}{{r|mccosky20041129}} A spectator, John Green, then threw a plastic cup of [[Diet Coke]] at Artest, hitting him in the chest.<ref name="firstreport"/><ref name="John Green">{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=4670842|title=Fan details strides made since brawl|date=November 19, 2009|work=ESPN.com|access-date=November 19, 2009|quote='I remember throwing the cup, actually a cup of Diet Coke, not a beer, but I had been drinking and I've had issues with alcohol in the past.'

Artest immediately reacted to this by jumping off the table, charging into the [[bleacher|stands]], and grabbing another spectator, Michael Ryan, whom he mistakenly believed was responsible. Artest shouted at Ryan, "Did you do it?", to which Ryan replied, "No, man. No!" Boyle stood from his chair at the broadcast table in an attempt to hold back Artest and was knocked backwards and stepped on, suffering five fractured vertebrae and a gouge on his head.<ref name="knightridder"/> Afterwards, Artest apologized to Boyle and said he hadn't realized he'd trampled him.{{r|abrams20120229}}

Jackson followed Artest into the stands and punched a fan, William Paulson, in the face in retaliation for the man throwing another drink in Artest's face while he was being restrained by other spectators.<ref name="nytimes"/> Pacers players [[Eddie Gill]], [[David Harrison (basketball)|David Harrison]], [[Reggie Miller]] (who did not play because of an injury), [[Fred Jones (basketball)|Fred Jones]], and Jamaal Tinsley, the Pistons' Rasheed Wallace, and numerous personnel (including Pistons radio analyst and former player [[Rick Mahorn]]) also quickly entered the stands to get Artest and Jackson, and to break up the fighting. Green punched Artest twice in the head from behind, as did Ben Wallace's brother, David, to Jones.{{r|abrams20120229}} More fans then began throwing drinks, food, and other objects into the melee and some fans went on the court in the confusion.<ref name="firstreport"/>

As Artest walked out of the stands, he was confronted by two more fans, Alvin "A.J." Shackleford and Charlie Haddad, who had gone down to the court.{{r|abrams20120229}} Artest punched Shackleford in the face, causing Haddad to intervene by pushing away Artest, before both fans fell over. While Haddad was on the floor, [[Anthony Johnson (basketball)|Anthony Johnson]] struck him in the back of the head. As Haddad stood up, [[Jermaine O'Neal]] punched him in the jaw after a running start,<ref name="firstreport"/> while slipping in liquid and falling backwards, causing witnesses [[Scot Pollard]], ESPN sideline reporter [[Jim Gray (sportscaster)|Jim Gray]], and Pistons executive Tom Wilson to briefly fear that O'Neal would kill Haddad.{{r|abrams20120229}}

O'Neal later claimed that Haddad had been asked to leave the arena earlier that night, and was well known to security because of claims that he wanted to fight an NBA player in order to receive compensation. [[William Wesley]] pulled Artest away from the fans,{{r|abrams20120229}} and Brown tried to calm Wallace.{{r|knightridder}} The scene became more chaotic as additional fans went onto the court and additional items were thrown, overwhelming arena security personnel as they tried to reestablish order. Although [[Auburn Hills, Michigan|Auburn Hills]] police had plans to handle many disorders, and had three officers in the arena, they were unprepared for the possibility of players entering the stands or masses of fans going onto the court.{{r|abrams20120229}}<ref name="firstreport"/>

Pacers coach [[Rick Carlisle]] said, "I felt like I was fighting for my life out there."{{r|knightridder}}{{r|recap}} One reporter who attempted to stop Tinsley from entering the stands recalled that the player "went through me like I was butter", and [[Commissioner of the NBA|NBA Commissioner]] [[David Stern]], watching the game on television, recalled that he said, "Holy [''mouths a swear word'']." O'Neal later said, "As bad as it looked on TV, it was at least 20 times worse in person." Pacers assistant coach [[Chuck Person]] compared the situation to being "trapped in a [[gladiator]]-type scene where the fans were the lions and we were just trying to escape with our lives. That's how it felt. That there was no exit. That you had to fight your way out." Players' children and others in the audience cried from fear and shock. [[Derrick Coleman]] stood near Brown and Brown's [[ball boy]] son to protect them.{{r|abrams20120229}}

Referees ended the game with 45.9 seconds remaining, and awarded the Pacers with a 97–82 win.<ref name="recap"/> Pistons fans booed the Pacers players as they were escorted from the court by officials and security, and continued to throw beverages, popcorn and other objects (including a steel [[folding chair]] that nearly hit O'Neal) at them as they walked under the tunnel to the locker room.{{r|abrams20120229}}<ref name="knightridder"/> Brown tried to talk to the fans over the loudspeaker of the arena in an attempt to stop the debacle, but his pleas availed nothing, and he threw down the microphone in exasperation.<ref>{{cite web|first=Mark|last=Montieth|title=Five years on, perceptions, lessons of infamous Palace brawl changing|url=https://www.si.com/more-sports/2009/11/19/brawl|website=SI.com|date=November 19, 2009|access-date=January 18, 2020|archive-date=August 6, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200806040744/https://www.si.com/more-sports/2009/11/19/brawl|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|first=Ken|last=Haddad|title=15 years later: Remembering the 2004 Pistons-Pacers brawl|url=https://www.clickondetroit.com/sports/2019/11/19/15-years-later-remembering-the-2004-pistons-pacers-brawl/|website=ClickOnDetroit.com|date=November 19, 2019|access-date=January 18, 2020|archive-date=December 2, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191202223025/https://www.clickondetroit.com/sports/2019/11/19/15-years-later-remembering-the-2004-pistons-pacers-brawl/|url-status=live}}</ref>

In the Pacers' locker room, O'Neal and Carlisle nearly got into a fight, as O'Neal was upset that some coaches had tried to restrain players while they were defending themselves out on the court.{{r|abrams20120229}} After everyone calmed down, Artest asked Jackson, "Jack, you think we going to get in trouble?"

===Suspensions===
On November 20, 2004, the NBA suspended Artest, Jackson, O'Neal, and Wallace indefinitely,<ref name="indefinitely"/> saying that their actions were "shocking, repulsive, and inexcusable".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/news/commissioner_statement_041120.html|title=Statement from NBA Commissioner David Stern Concerning the Altercation During the Detroit Pistons and Indiana Pacers Game Last Night at The Palace of Auburn Hills|date=November 20, 2004|work=NBA.com|publisher=Turner Sports Interactive, Inc|access-date=May 17, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120604185608/http://www.nba.com/news/commissioner_statement_041120.html|archive-date=June 4, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> The following day, the NBA announced that nine players would be suspended for a total of what eventually became 146 games: 137 games for Pacers players and nine games for Pistons players.<ref name="suspensions">{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=1928540|title=Suspensions without pay, won't be staggered|date=November 21, 2004|work=ESPN.com|access-date=May 3, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041208060548/http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=1928540|archive-date=December 8, 2004|url-status=dead}}</ref> David Harrison was also seen fighting with fans, but the NBA stated that he would not be suspended because "the incident occurred as the players were attempting to leave the floor".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=1930077|title=Union director suggests 35-game maximum|date=November 28, 2004|work=ESPN.com|access-date=May 3, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041208075819/http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=1930077|archive-date=December 8, 2004|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Artest was given the longest suspension; he was suspended for the remainder of the [[2004–05 NBA season]], a suspension that eventually totaled 86&nbsp;games (73 regular season and 13 subsequent playoff games), the [[List of people banned or suspended by the NBA|longest suspension]] for an on-court incident in NBA history.<ref name="suspensions"/> The players suspended also lost in excess of [[United States dollar|US$]]11&nbsp;million in salary due to the suspensions,<ref name="suspensions"/> with Artest alone losing almost US$5&nbsp;million.<ref name="infamy">{{cite web|url=http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/10089645/site/21683474/|title=Palace brawl lives in infamy 1 year later|date=November 26, 2005|publisher=[[MSNBC]]|access-date=May 16, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120719174244/http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/10089645/site/21683474/|archive-date=July 19, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In the week following the announcement of the suspensions, the [[National Basketball Players Association|players' union]] appealed the suspensions of Artest, Jackson, and O'Neal, saying they thought that commissioner Stern had "exceeded his authority".<ref name="suspensions"/> Jackson felt that despite losing millions the players were fortunate, as Stern could have expelled them from the league entirely.{{r|abrams20120229}}

A federal [[arbitration|arbitrator]] upheld the full length of all suspensions, except that of O'Neal, which was reduced to 15 games.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/2004/12/23/sports/basketball/23brawl.htmll|title=N.B.A. Seeks to Overturn Arbitrator's Shorter Ban for O'Neal|last=Robbins|first=Liz|date=December 23, 2004|work=The New York Times|access-date=September 11, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110919152703/http://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/23/sports/basketball/23brawl.html|archive-date=September 19, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> However, the NBA appealed the decision of the arbitrator to reduce O'Neal's suspension in federal court, and on December 24, a judge issued a temporary injunction allowing O'Neal to play until a full hearing was held on the NBA's appeal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=1952624|title=Final decision expected Dec. 30|date=December 24, 2004|work=ESPN.com|access-date=May 3, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050115152312/http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=1952624|archive-date=January 15, 2005|url-status=dead}}</ref>

O'Neal played in two more games before the NBA's case was brought before the [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York|U.S. District Court]] in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]], on December 30. The NBA argued that under the terms of the league's [[NBA Collective Bargaining Agreement|Collective Bargaining Agreement]] (CBA), Stern had absolute authority to hand out suspensions and hear appeals for all on-court incidents. However, the judge ruled that because O'Neal's behavior was an off-court incident, arbitration was allowed under the CBA and thus the arbitrator was within his rights to reduce the suspension.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=1955959|title=Judge: Arbitrator had right to shorten penalty|date=December 30, 2004|work=ESPN.com|access-date=May 16, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050115152312/http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=1952624|archive-date=January 15, 2005|url-status=dead}}</ref> Despite O'Neal's successful appeal, no further appeals were made to reduce Artest's and Jackson's suspensions.

He said that Artest had apologized to him several months earlier, and wished to work together in some type of community service in Detroit.<ref name="John Green"/> On June 9, 2017, Artest (then known as Metta World Peace) appeared on ''[[Rich Eisen|The Rich Eisen Show]]'' and alluded to his friendship with Green.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbQjjhgU5jo]{{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211002231910/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbQjjhgU5jo|date=2021-10-02}}<span> Metta World Peace interview</span>, ''The Rich Eisen Show'', June 9, 2017.</ref>
