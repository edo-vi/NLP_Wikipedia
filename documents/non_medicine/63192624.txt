'''Astranis Space Technologies Corp.''' is an American company specializing in [[Geostationary orbit|geostationary]] communications satellites. It is headquartered in San Francisco, California.

In 2018, Astranis launched DemoSat-2, a prototype 3U [[CubeSat|cubesat]]. The launch aimed to test Software-Defined Radio ([[Software-defined radio|SDR]]) technology for future larger communications satellites.<ref name="skyrocket-demosat2">{{Cite web |last=Krebs |first=Gunter Dirk |url=https://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/demosat-2.htm |title=DemoSat 2 |website=Gunter's Space Page |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230729183447/https://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/demosat-2.htm |archive-date=July 29, 2023 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The company publicly disclosed its projects in March 2018, following a funding round that was aimed at the development of geostationary communications satellites.<ref name="wired-2018">{{Cite news |last=Finley |first=Klint |title=Can These Small Satellites Solve the Riddle of Internet From Space? |url=https://www.wired.com/story/can-these-small-satellites-solve-the-riddle-of-internet-from-space/ |date=March 1, 2018 |work=[[Wired (magazine)|WIRED]] |publisher=Condé Nast |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230729183448/https://www.wired.com/story/can-these-small-satellites-solve-the-riddle-of-internet-from-space/ |archive-date=July 29, 2023 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="geekwire-2018">{{Cite news |last=Boyle |first=Alan |title=With $13.5M boost, Astranis unveils big plan to beam internet from small satellites |url=https://www.geekwire.com/2018/13-5m-boost-astranis-unveils-big-plans-beam-internet-small-satellites/ |date=March 1, 2018 |work=[[GeekWire]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230729183448/https://www.geekwire.com/2018/13-5m-boost-astranis-unveils-big-plans-beam-internet-small-satellites/ |archive-date=July 29, 2023 |url-status=live }}</ref>

== History ==

=== Demonstration satellite ===
On January 12, 2018, Astranis launched its first satellite, "DemoSat 2", using an Indian [[PSLV-XL]] rocket. The satellite was a 3U cubesat measuring 10 cm x 10 cm x 30 cm and weighing less than 3 kg. It carried a prototype of the company's software-defined radio.<ref name="skyrocket-demosat2" /><ref name="techcrunch-2018">{{Cite news |last=Shieber |first=Jonathan |url=https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/01/astranis-emerges-from-stealth-with-a-new-satellite-technology-for-connecting-the-world/ |title=Astranis emerges from stealth with a new satellite technology for connecting the world |date=March 1, 2018 |work=[[TechCrunch]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180301150939/https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/01/astranis-emerges-from-stealth-with-a-new-satellite-technology-for-connecting-the-world/ |archive-date=March 1, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>

=== Geostationary satellites ===

==== Block 1 ====
In 2019, Astranis leased its first MicroGEO spacecraft to Pacific Dataport, Inc., a subsidiary of Microcom.<ref name="alaskajournal-2019" /> The satellite, named Arcturus, initially had an anticipated launch date in early 2022,<ref name="fcc-petition-2021">{{cite web |url=https://fcc.report/IBFS/SAT-PPL-20210607-00075/8982903.pdf |title=Petition for Declaratory Ruling |year=2021 |publisher=[[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230523150834/https://fcc.report/IBFS/SAT-PPL-20210607-00075/8982903.pdf |archive-date=23 May 2023 |url-status=live }}</ref> which was later delayed to April 2023.<ref name="skyrocket-viasat3" /> After the launch, the company confirmed successful communication with the satellite and hardware deployment. Subsequent tests showed the spacecraft could deliver up to 8.5 Gbps, compared to its design specification of 7.5 Gbps.<ref name="cnbc-sheetz-2023-may">{{cite news |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/24/astranis-first-internet-satellite-over-alaska-working-perfectly.html |title=Astranis says its first internet satellite is working ‘perfectly’ as company prepares to bring coverage to Alaska |date=May 24, 2023 |work=[[CNBC]] |author=Michael Sheetz |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230916142947/https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/24/astranis-first-internet-satellite-over-alaska-working-perfectly.html |archive-date=September 16, 2023 |url-status=live |access-date=July 22, 2023}}</ref>

n July 2023, Astranis reported a malfunction in an externally supplied solar array drive assembly on Arcturus, which affected the spacecraft's ability to provide internet service. According to Astranis CEO John Gedmark, no hardware built by Astranis failed.<ref name="cnbc-sheetz-2023-july">{{Cite news |last=Sheetz |first=Michael |date=July 21, 2023 |title=Astranis internet satellite malfunctions before beginning Alaska service, backup planned for spring |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/21/astranis-alaska-internet-satellite-malfunctions-backup-planned.html |access-date=July 22, 2023 |work=[[CNBC]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230818054742/https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/21/astranis-alaska-internet-satellite-malfunctions-backup-planned.html |archive-date=August 18, 2023 |url-status=live }}</ref>

==== Block 2 ====
In April 2022, Astranis signed a launch contract with SpaceX for their "Block 2" MicroGEO spacecraft. The company had previously initiated component orders for these spacecraft, with an initial aim to complete them by the end of 2022.<ref name="astranis-businesswire-2022">{{Cite press release |date=April 5, 2022 |title=Astranis Space Technologies Signs Contract with SpaceX for Dedicated Multi-Satellite Launch in 2023 |url=https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220405005129/en/Astranis-Space-Technologies-Signs-Contract-with-SpaceX-for-Dedicated-Multi-Satellite-Launch-in-2023 |publisher=Astranis |via=BusinessWire |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230119112800/https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220405005129/en/Astranis-Space-Technologies-Signs-Contract-with-SpaceX-for-Dedicated-Multi-Satellite-Launch-in-2023 |archive-date=January 19, 2023 |url-status=live |access-date=July 22, 2023 }}</ref>

==== Block 3 ====
Block 3, consisting of five satellites, is planned to launch mid-2024.<ref name="sheetz-cnbc-philippines-2023">{{Cite news |last=Sheetz |first=Michael |date=July 11, 2023 |title=Astranis to bring satellite internet to 2 million people in the Philippines next year |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/11/astranis-satellite-internet-coming-to-the-philippines-next-year.html |access-date=July 22, 2023 |work=[[CNBC]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230906150049/https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/11/astranis-satellite-internet-coming-to-the-philippines-next-year.html |archive-date=September 6, 2023 |url-status=live}}</ref>

==== Future ====
A replacement for Arcturus is scheduled for early 2025.<ref name="cnbc-sheetz-2023-july" /> Astranis CEO John Gedmark stated in April 2022 that the company aims to have over 100 satellites in active service by 2030.<ref name="astranis-businesswire-2022" />
