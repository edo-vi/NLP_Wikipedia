{{Vaccination}}

'''Vaccination''' is the administration of a [[vaccine]] to help the [[immune system]] develop immunity from a disease. Vaccines contain a [[microorganism]] or [[virus]] in a weakened, live or killed state, or [[protein]]s or [[toxin]]s from the organism. In stimulating the body's [[Adaptive immune system|adaptive immunity]], they help prevent sickness from an [[infectious disease]]. When a sufficiently large percentage of a population has been vaccinated, [[herd immunity]] results. Herd immunity protects those who may be immunocompromised and cannot get a vaccine because even a weakened version would harm them.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Herd immunity (Herd protection) {{!}} Vaccine Knowledge|url=https://vk.ovg.ox.ac.uk/vk/herd-immunity|access-date=12 November 2020|website=vk.ovg.ox.ac.uk}}</ref> The effectiveness of vaccination has been widely studied and verified.<ref>{{Cite book | vauthors = Fiore AE, Bridges CB, Cox J |chapter=Seasonal Influenza Vaccines |series=Current Topics in Microbiology and Immunology |title=Vaccines for Pandemic Influenza |volume=333 |pages=43–82 |year=2009 |pmid=19768400 |doi=10.1007/978-3-540-92165-3_3 |isbn=978-3-540-92164-6|s2cid=33549265 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Chang Y, Brewer NT, Rinas AC, Schmitt K, Smith JS | title = Evaluating the impact of human papillomavirus vaccines | journal = Vaccine | volume = 27 | issue = 32 | pages = 4355–62 | date = July 2009 | pmid = 19515467 | doi = 10.1016/j.vaccine.2009.03.008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Liesegang TJ | title = Varicella zoster virus vaccines: effective, but concerns linger | journal = Canadian Journal of Ophthalmology | volume = 44 | issue = 4 | pages = 379–84 | date = August 2009 | pmid = 19606157 | doi = 10.3129/i09-126 }}</ref> Vaccination is the most effective method of preventing infectious diseases;<ref>{{cite book | title = A CDC framework for preventing infectious diseases | url = https://www.cdc.gov/oid/docs/ID-Framework.pdf | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120914102409/https://www.cdc.gov/oid/docs/ID-Framework.pdf | archive-date = 14 September 2012 | publisher = United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention | date = October 2011 | quote = Vaccines are our most effective and cost-saving tools for disease prevention, preventing untold suffering and saving tens of thousands of lives and billions of dollars in healthcare costs each year }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | vauthors = Gellin B | title = Vaccines and Infectious Diseases: Putting Risk into Perspective | url = https://iaomt.org/TestFoundation/lifesaver.htm | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20101124130606/https://iaomt.org/TestFoundation/lifesaver.htm | archive-date = 24 November 2010 | work = American Medical Association Briefing on Microbial Threats | location = National Press Club Washington, DC  | date = 1 June 2000 | quote = Vaccines are the most effective public health tool ever created. }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = Vaccine-preventable diseases | date = 7 October 2002 | url = http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/im/vpd-mev/index-eng.php | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120324030536/http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/im/vpd-mev/index-eng.php | archive-date = 24 March 2012 | quote = Vaccines still provide the most effective, longest-lasting method of preventing infectious diseases in all age groups | publisher = Public Health Agency of Canada }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | work = United States National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) | url = http://virtualbiosecuritycenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Library-NIAID-Biodefense-Research-Agenda-for-Category-B-and-C-Priority-Pathogens.pdf | title = NIAID Biodefense Research Agenda for Category B and C Priority Pathogens | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160304065419/http://virtualbiosecuritycenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Library-NIAID-Biodefense-Research-Agenda-for-Category-B-and-C-Priority-Pathogens.pdf | archive-date = 4 March 2016 | quote = Vaccines are the most effective method of protecting the public against infectious diseases. }}</ref> widespread immunity due to vaccination is largely responsible for the [[Eradication of infectious diseases|worldwide eradication]] of [[smallpox]] and the elimination of diseases such as [[polio]] and [[tetanus]] from much of the world.

''Vaccination'' and ''[[immunization]]'' have a similar meaning in everyday language. This is distinct from inoculation, which uses unweakened live pathogens. Vaccination efforts have been met with [[Vaccine controversy|some reluctance]] on scientific, ethical, political, medical safety, and religious grounds, although no major religions oppose vaccination, and some consider it an obligation due to the potential to save lives.<ref name="nyt19">{{cite web | vauthors = McNeil DG |title=Religious Objections to the Measles Vaccine?

Vaccines are a way of [[artificial induction of immunity|artificially activating the immune system]] to protect against [[infectious disease]]. The activation occurs through priming the [[immune system]] with an [[immunogen]].  Stimulating immune responses with an infectious agent is known as ''[[immunization]]''. Vaccination includes various ways of administering immunogens.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kwong PD | title = What Are the Most Powerful Immunogen Design Vaccine Strategies?

Most vaccines are administered before a patient has contracted a disease to help increase future protection. However, some vaccines are administered after the patient already has contracted a disease. Vaccines given after exposure to smallpox are reported to offer some protection from disease or may reduce the severity of disease.<ref name="CDCvac">{{cite web |url=http://www.bt.cdc.gov/agent/smallpox/vaccination/pdf/vaccine-overview.pdf |title=Vaccine Overview |access-date=2 January 2008 |website=Smallpox Fact Sheet |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080102234114/http://www.bt.cdc.gov/agent/smallpox/vaccination/pdf/vaccine-overview.pdf |archive-date=2 January 2008 |url-status=dead}}</ref> The first [[rabies]] immunization was given by [[Louis Pasteur]] to a child after he was bitten by a [[Rabies|rabid]] dog.

Most vaccines are given by injection as they are not absorbed reliably through the [[intestines]]. Live attenuated polio, rotavirus, some typhoid, and some cholera vaccines are given orally to produce immunity in the bowel. While vaccination provides a lasting effect, it usually takes several weeks to develop. This differs from [[passive immunity]] (the transfer of [[antibodies]], such as in breastfeeding), which has immediate effect.<ref>{{cite web | url =https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vac-gen/immunity-types.htm|title=Immunity Types|publisher=[[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]]| access-date=20 October 2015}}</ref>

A vaccine failure is when an [[organism]] contracts a disease in spite of being vaccinated against it. Primary [[vaccine]] failure occurs when an organism's immune system does not produce [[antibody|antibodies]] when first vaccinated. Vaccines can fail when several series are given and fail to produce an immune response. The term "vaccine failure" does not necessarily imply that the vaccine is defective. Most vaccine failures are simply due to individual variations in immune response.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wiedermann U, Garner-Spitzer E, Wagner A | title = Primary vaccine failure to routine vaccines: Why and what to do? | journal = Human Vaccines & Immunotherapeutics | volume = 12 | issue = 1 | pages = 239–43 | date = 2016 | pmid = 26836329 | pmc = 4962729 | doi = 10.1080/21645515.2015.1093263 }}</ref>

===Vaccination versus inoculation===
The term "[[inoculation]]" is often used interchangeably with "vaccination." However, while related, the terms are not synonymous. Vaccination is treatment of an individual with an attenuated (i.e. less virulent) [[pathogen]] or other [[immunogen]], whereas inoculation, also called [[variolation]] in the context of [[smallpox]] prophylaxis, is treatment with unattenuated variola virus taken from a pustule or scab of a smallpox patient into the superficial layers of the skin, commonly the upper arm. Variolation was often done 'arm-to-arm' or, less effectively, 'scab-to-arm', and often caused the patient to become infected with smallpox, which in some cases resulted in severe disease.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://web.uvic.ca/vv/student/smallpox/doctors/diff.html|title=The Smallpox Epidemic of 1862 (Victoria BC)--Doctors and Diagnosis|website=web.uvic.ca|access-date=29 September 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.uvic.ca/vv/student/smallpox/doctors/diff.html |title=Doctors and diagnosis ''The difference between Vaccination and Inoculation'' |publisher=Web.uvic.ca |access-date=8 January 2014}}</ref>

===Preventing disease versus preventing infection===

Some vaccines, like the smallpox vaccine, prevent infection. Their use results in [[sterilizing immunity]] and can help eradicate a disease if there is no animal reserve. Other vaccines, including those for {{Nowrap|[[COVID-19]]}}, help to (temporarily) lower the chance of severe disease for individuals, without necessarily reducing the probability of becoming infected.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://theconversation.com/coronavirus-few-vaccines-prevent-infection-heres-why-thats-not-a-problem-152204|title=Coronavirus: few vaccines prevent infection – here's why that's not a problem |date=5 January 2021 |last=Caddy |first=Sarah L. |website=[[The Conversation (website)|The Conversation]] |access-date=18 December 2022}}</ref>

=== Vaccine development and approval ===
Just like any medication or procedure, no vaccine can be 100% safe or effective for everyone because each person's body can react differently.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/ensuringsafety/history/index.html|title=History of Vaccine Safety History Ensuring Safety Vaccine Safety CDC|date=10 January 2019|website=www.cdc.gov|access-date=12 March 2019}}</ref><ref name=":6">{{cite journal | vauthors = Chen RT, Hibbs B | s2cid = 13364842 | title = Vaccine safety: current and future challenges | journal = Pediatric Annals | volume = 27 | issue = 7 | pages = 445–55 | date = July 1998 | pmid = 9677616 | doi = 10.3928/0090-4481-19980701-11 }}</ref> While minor [[side effect]]s, such as soreness or low grade fever, are relatively common, serious side effects are very rare and occur in about 1 out of every 100,000 vaccinations and typically involve [[Allergy|allergic reactions]] that can cause hives or difficulty breathing.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|url=https://www.niaid.nih.gov/research/making-safe-vaccines|title=Making Safe Vaccines NIH: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases|website=www.niaid.nih.gov|access-date=12 March 2019}}</ref><ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vac-gen/side-effects.htm|title=Vaccines: Vac-Gen/Side Effects|date=12 July 2018|website=www.cdc.gov|access-date=12 March 2019}}</ref>

However, vaccines are the safest they ever have been in history and each vaccine undergoes rigorous clinical trials to ensure their safety and [[Vaccine efficacy|efficacy]] before approval by authorities such as the US [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA).<ref name=":3">{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/ensuringsafety/index.html|title=Ensuring Vaccine Safety Ensuring Safety Vaccine Safety CDC|date=12 December 2018|website=www.cdc.gov|access-date=12 March 2019}}</ref>

Prior to human testing, vaccines are tested on [[cell culture]]s and the results modelled to assess how they will interact with the immune system.<ref name=":2" /><ref name=":3" /> During the next round of testing, researchers study vaccines in animals, including [[Mouse|mice]], [[rabbit]]s, [[guinea pig]]s, and [[monkey]]s.<ref name=":2" /> Vaccines that pass each of these stages of testing are then approved by the public health safety authority (FDA in the United States) to start a three-phase series of human testing, advancing to higher phases only if they are deemed safe and effective at the previous phase. The people in these trials participate voluntarily and are required to prove they understand the purpose of the study and the potential risks.<ref name=":3" />

During phase I trials, a vaccine is tested in a group of about 20 people with the primary goal of assessing the vaccine's safety.<ref name=":2" /> Phase II trials expand the testing to include 50 to several hundred people. During this stage, the vaccine's safety continues to be evaluated and researchers also gather data on the effectiveness and the ideal dose of the vaccine.<ref name=":2" /> Vaccines determined to be safe and efficacious then advance to phase III trials, which focuses on the efficacy of the vaccine in hundreds to thousands of volunteers. This phase can take several years to complete and researchers use this opportunity to compare the vaccinated volunteers to those who have not been vaccinated to highlight any true reactions to the vaccine that occur.<ref name=":3" />

If a vaccine passes all of the phases of testing, the manufacturer can then apply for license of the vaccine through the relevant regulatory authorities such as the FDA in US. Before regulatory authorities approve use in the general public, they extensively review the results of the clinical trials, safety tests, purity tests, and manufacturing methods and establish that the manufacturer itself is up to government standards in many other areas.<ref name=":2" /><ref name=":who_vac_dev">{{Cite web|url=https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail/how-are-vaccines-developed|title=How are vaccines developed? WHO|date=8 December 2020|website=www.who.int|access-date=26 October 2023}}</ref>

After regulatory approval, the regulators continue to monitor the manufacturing protocols, batch purity, and the manufacturing facility itself. Additionally, vaccines also undergo phase IV trials, which monitor the safety and efficacy of vaccines in tens of thousands of people, or more, across many years.<ref name=":2" /><ref name=":who_vac_dev" />

=== Side effects ===
The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) has compiled a list of vaccines and their possible side effects.<ref name=":1" /> The risk of side effects varies from one vaccine to the next, but below are examples of side effects and their approximate rate of occurrence with the [[DPT vaccine|diphtheria, tetanus, and acellular pertussis]] (DTaP) vaccine, a common childhood vaccine.<ref name=":1" />

In 1976 in the United States, a mass [[1976 swine flu outbreak|a swine flu vaccination programme]] was discontinued after 362 cases of [[Guillain–Barré syndrome]] among 45 million vaccinated people. [[William Foege]] of the CDC estimated that the incidence of Guillain-Barré was four times higher in vaccinated people than in those not receiving the swine flu vaccine.

[[Dengvaxia]], the only approved vaccine for [[Dengue fever]], was found to increase the risk of hospitalization for Dengue fever by 1.58 times in children of 9 years or younger, resulting in the suspension of a mass vaccination program in the Philippines in 2017.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Redoni M, Yacoub S, Rivino L, Giacobbe DR, Luzzati R, Di Bella S | title = Dengue: Status of current and under-development vaccines | journal = Reviews in Medical Virology | volume = 30 | issue = 4 | pages = e2101 | date = July 2020 | pmid = 32101634 | doi = 10.1002/rmv.2101 | hdl-access = free | s2cid = 211536962 | hdl = 1983/6d38d9b6-8e1b-4a84-85e3-edab4fc41957 | url = https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/publications/6d38d9b6-8e1b-4a84-85e3-edab4fc41957 }}</ref>

==== Mercury ====
Certain vaccines once contained a compound called [[thiomersal]] or thimerosal, which is an [[organic compound]] containing [[Mercury (element)|mercury]]. [[Organomercury]] is commonly found in two forms. The [[methylmercury]] cation (with one carbon atom) is found in mercury-contaminated fish and is the form that people might ingest in mercury-polluted areas ([[Minamata disease]]), whereas the [[ethylmercury]] cation (with two carbon atoms) is present in thimerosal, linked to [[thiosalicylic acid|thiosalicylate]].<ref name=":5">{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/thimerosal/index.html|title=Thimerosal in Vaccines Thimerosal Concerns Vaccine Safety CDC|date=24 January 2019|website=www.cdc.gov|access-date=22 March 2019}}</ref> Although both are organomercury compounds, they do not have the same chemical properties and interact with the human body differently.

Thimerosal was used as a [[preservative]] to prevent the growth of [[bacteria]] and [[Fungus|fungi]] in vials that contain more than one dose of a vaccine.<ref name=":5" /> This helps reduce the risk of potential [[infection]]s or serious illness that could occur from [[contamination]] of a vaccine vial.

Before the first vaccinations, in the sense of using [[cowpox]] to inoculate people against [[smallpox]], people have been inoculated in China and elsewhere, before being copied in [[Western world|the west]], by using smallpox, called [[variolation]]. The earliest hints of the practice of variolation for smallpox in China come during the 10th century.<ref name="needham volume 6 part 6 154">{{cite book| vauthors = Needham J |title=Science and Civilisation in China: Volume 6, Biology and Biological Technology, Part 6, Medicine|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2000|isbn=9780521632621|page=154}}</ref> The Chinese also practiced the oldest documented use of variolation, which comes from [[Wan Quan]]'s (1499–1582) Douzhen Xinfa (痘疹心法) of 1549. They implemented a method of "nasal [[Insufflation (medicine)|insufflation]]" administered by blowing powdered smallpox material, usually scabs, up the nostrils. Various insufflation techniques have been recorded throughout the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries within China.<ref name="Williams2010">{{cite book| vauthors = Williams G |title=Angel of Death|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2010|isbn=978-0-230-27471-6|location=Basingstoke c}}</ref>{{rp|60}} Two reports on the Chinese practice of [[inoculation]] were received by the [[Royal Society]] in London in 1700; one by [[Martin Lister]] who received a report by an employee of the [[East India Company]] stationed in China and another by [[Clopton Havers]].<ref>{{cite book| vauthors = Silverstein AM |title=A History of Immunology|publisher=Academic Press|year=2009|isbn=9780080919461|edition=2nd|page=293}}</ref> In France, [[Voltaire]] reports that the Chinese have practiced variolation "these hundred years".

In 1796, [[Edward Jenner]], a doctor in [[Berkeley, Gloucestershire|Berkeley]] in [[Gloucestershire]], England, tested a common theory that a person who had contracted cowpox would be immune from smallpox. To test the theory, he took cowpox [[Vesicle (dermatology)|vesicle]]s from a [[milkmaid]] named Sarah Nelmes with which he infected an eight-year-old boy named [[James Phipps]], and two months later he inoculated the boy with smallpox, and smallpox did not develop. In 1798, Jenner published ''[[wikisource:An Inquiry Into the Causes and Effects of the Variolæ Vaccinæ|An Inquiry Into the Causes and Effects of the Variolæ Vaccinæ]]'' which created widespread interest. He distinguished 'true' and 'spurious' cowpox (which did not give the desired effect) and developed an "arm-to-arm" method of propagating the vaccine from the vaccinated individual's [[Skin condition|pustule]]. Early attempts at confirmation were confounded by contamination with smallpox, but despite controversy within the medical profession and religious opposition to the use of animal material, by 1801 his report was translated into six languages and over 100,000 people were vaccinated.<ref name="GrossSepkowitz">{{cite journal | vauthors = Gross CP, Sepkowitz KA | title = The myth of the medical breakthrough: smallpox, vaccination, and Jenner reconsidered | journal = International Journal of Infectious Diseases | volume = 3 | issue = 1 | pages = 54–60 | date = July 1998 | pmid = 9831677 | doi = 10.1016/s1201-9712(98)90096-0 | doi-access = free }}</ref> The term ''vaccination'' was coined in 1800 by the surgeon Richard Dunning in his text ''Some observations on vaccination''.<ref>{{Cite web | vauthors = Dunning R | date = 1800 | publisher = March and Teape |url=https://curiosity.lib.harvard.edu/contagion/catalog/36-990061255320203941 |title=Some observations on vaccination, or, The inoculated cow-pox; Some observations on vaccination; Inoculated cow-pox; Observations, & c; Observations, &c|website=Contagion – CURIOSity Digital Collections|language=en|access-date=2 April 2020}}</ref>

The [[U.S. Supreme Court]] upheld compulsory vaccination laws in the 1905 landmark case [[Jacobson v. Massachusetts]], ruling that laws could require vaccination to protect the public from dangerous communicable diseases. However, in practice the U.S. had the lowest rate of vaccination among industrialized nations in the early 20th century. Compulsory vaccination laws began to be enforced in the U.S. after [[World War II]]. In 1959, the WHO called for the eradication of smallpox worldwide, as smallpox was still endemic in 33 countries. In the 1960s six to eight children died each year in the U.S. from vaccination-related complications. According to the WHO there were in 1966 about 100&nbsp;million cases of smallpox worldwide, causing an estimated two million deaths. In the 1970s there was such a small risk of contracting smallpox that the [[U.S. Public Health Service]] recommended for routine smallpox vaccination to be ended. By 1974 the WHO smallpox vaccination program had confined smallpox to parts of [[Pakistan]], India, [[Bangladesh]], [[Ethiopia]] and [[Somalia]]. In 1977 the WHO recorded the last case of smallpox infection acquired outside a laboratory in Somalia. In 1980 the WHO officially declared the world free of smallpox.<ref name = "Magner_2009" />{{rp|115–116}}

In 1974 the WHO adopted the goal of universal vaccination by 1990 to protect children against six preventable infectious diseases: [[measles]], [[poliomyelitis]], [[diphtheria]], [[whooping cough]], [[tetanus]], and [[tuberculosis]].<ref name = "Magner_2009" />{{rp|119}} In the 1980s only 20 to 40% of children in developing countries were vaccinated against these six diseases. In wealthy nations the number of measles cases had dropped dramatically after the introduction of the [[measles vaccine]] in 1963. WHO figures demonstrate that in many countries a decline in measles vaccination leads to a resurgence in measles cases. Measles are so contagious that public health experts believe a vaccination rate of 100% is needed to control the disease.<ref name = "Magner_2009" />{{rp|120}} Despite decades of mass vaccination polio remains a threat in India, [[Nigeria]], [[Somalia]], [[Niger]], [[Afghanistan]], Bangladesh and [[Indonesia]]. By 2006 global health experts concluded that the eradication of polio was only possible if the supply of [[drinking water]] and [[sanitation]] facilities were improved in [[slums]].<ref name="Magner_2009" />{{rp|124}} The deployment of a combined [[DPT vaccine]] against [[diphtheria]], [[pertussis]] (whooping cough), and [[tetanus]] in the 1950s was considered a major advancement for public health. But in the course of vaccination campaigns that spanned decades, DPT vaccines became associated with large number of cases with side effects. Despite improved DPT vaccines coming onto the market in the 1990s DPT vaccines became the focus of [[anti-vaccination]] campaigns in wealthy nations. As immunization rates fell outbreaks of [[pertussis]] increased in many countries.<ref name = "Magner_2009" />{{rp|128}}

In 2000, the [[Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization]] was established to strengthen routine vaccinations and introduce new and underused vaccines in countries with a per capita GDP of under US$1000.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Jaupart P, Dipple L, Dercon S |date=3 December 2019 |title=Has Gavi lived up to its promise?

To eliminate the risk of [[Disease outbreak|outbreaks]] of some diseases, at various times governments and other institutions have employed policies requiring vaccination for all people. For example, an 1853 law required universal vaccination against smallpox in England and Wales, with fines levied on people who did not comply.<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Brunton D |title=The Politics of Vaccination: Practice and Policy in England, Wales, Ireland, and Scotland, 1800–1874 |date=2008 |publisher=University of Rochester Press |page=39}}</ref> Common contemporary U.S. vaccination policies require that children receive recommended vaccinations before entering public school.<ref>{{cite web |title=State Vaccination Requirements |url=https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/imz-managers/laws/state-reqs.html |publisher=CDC |access-date=7 December 2019|date=11 March 2019 }}</ref>

Beginning with early vaccination in the nineteenth century, these policies were resisted by a variety of groups, collectively called [[antivaccinationist]]s, who object on scientific, ethical, political, medical safety, [[vaccination and religion|religious]], and other grounds.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Tolley K |title=School Vaccination Wars |journal=History of Education Quarterly |date=May 2019 |volume=59 |issue=2 |pages=161–194 |doi=10.1017/heq.2019.3|doi-access=free }}</ref> Common objections are that vaccinations do not work, that compulsory vaccination constitutes excessive government intervention in personal matters, or that the proposed vaccinations are not sufficiently safe.<ref name="wolfesharp">{{cite journal | vauthors = Wolfe RM, Sharp LK | title = Anti-vaccinationists past and present | journal = BMJ | volume = 325 | issue = 7361 | pages = 430–2 | date = August 2002 | pmid = 12193361 | pmc = 1123944 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.325.7361.430 }}</ref> Many modern vaccination policies allow exemptions for people who have compromised immune systems, allergies to the components used in vaccinations or strongly held objections.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Salmon DA, Teret SP, MacIntyre CR, Salisbury D, Burgess MA, Halsey NA | s2cid = 19344405 | title = Compulsory vaccination and conscientious or philosophical exemptions: past, present, and future | journal = Lancet | volume = 367 | issue = 9508 | pages = 436–42 | date = February 2006 | pmid = 16458770 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(06)68144-0 }}</ref>

=== Fractional dose vaccination ===
[[Fractional dose vaccination]] reduces the dose of a vaccine to allow more individuals to be vaccinated with a given vaccine stock, trading societal benefit for individual protection.

====Vaccination and autism====
{{Main|Vaccines and autism}}

The notion of a connection between vaccines and autism originated in a 1998 paper published in ''[[The Lancet]]'' whose lead author was the physician [[Andrew Wakefield]]. His study concluded that eight of the 12 patients, ages 3 years to 10 years, developed behavioral symptoms consistent with autism following the [[MMR vaccine]] (an immunization against [[measles]], [[mumps]], and [[rubella]]).<ref name="Wakefield">{{cite journal | vauthors = Wakefield AJ, Murch SH, Anthony A, Linnell J, Casson DM, Malik M, Berelowitz M, Dhillon AP, Thomson MA, Harvey P, Valentine A, Davies SE, Walker-Smith JA | s2cid = 439791 | title = Ileal-lymphoid-nodular hyperplasia, non-specific colitis, and pervasive developmental disorder in children | journal = Lancet | volume = 351 | issue = 9103 | pages = 637–41 | date = February 1998 | pmid = 9500320 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(97)11096-0 | url = http://briandeer.com/mmr/lancet-paper.htm | author-link1 = Andrew Wakefield }}{{Retracted|intentional=yes}}</ref> The article was widely criticized for lack of scientific rigor and it was proven that Wakefield falsified data in the article.<ref name="Wakefield" /> In 2004, 10 of the original 12 co-authors (not including Wakefield) published a [[Retraction in academic publishing|retraction]] of the article and stated the following: "We wish to make it clear that in this paper no causal link was established between MMR vaccine and autism as the data were insufficient."<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Murch SH, Anthony A, Casson DH, Malik M, Berelowitz M, Dhillon AP, Thomson MA, Valentine A, Davies SE, Walker-Smith JA | s2cid = 5128036 | title = Retraction of an interpretation | journal = Lancet | volume = 363 | issue = 9411 | pages = 750 | date = March 2004 | pmid = 15016483 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(04)15715-2 }}</ref> In 2010, ''The Lancet'' officially retracted the article, stating that several elements of the article were incorrect, including falsified data and protocols. The article has sparked a much greater anti-vaccination movement, particularly in the United States, and even though the article was shown to be fraudulent and was heavily retracted, one in four parents still believe that vaccines can cause autism.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Daley MF, Glanz JM | title = Straight talk about vaccination | journal = Scientific American | volume = 305 | issue = 3 | pages = 32–34 | date = September 2011 | pmid = 21870438 | doi = 10.1038/scientificamerican0911-32 | bibcode = 2011SciAm.305b..32D }}</ref>

To date, all validated and definitive studies have shown that there is no correlation between vaccines and autism.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/autism.html|title=Vaccines Do Not Cause Autism Concerns Vaccine Safety CDC|date=6 February 2019|website=www.cdc.gov|access-date=22 March 2019}}</ref> One of the studies published in 2015 confirms there is no link between [[MMR vaccine and autism|autism and the MMR vaccine]]. Infants were given a health plan, that included an MMR vaccine, and were continuously studied until they reached five years old. There was no link between the vaccine and children who had a normally developed sibling or a sibling that had autism making them a higher risk for developing autism themselves.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Jain A, Marshall J, Buikema A, Bancroft T, Kelly JP, Newschaffer CJ | title = Autism occurrence by MMR vaccine status among US children with older siblings with and without autism | journal = JAMA | volume = 313 | issue = 15 | pages = 1534–40 | date = April 2015 | pmid = 25898051 | doi = 10.1001/jama.2015.3077 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

It can be difficult to correct the memory of humans when wrong information is received prior to correct information. Even though there is much evidence to go against the Wakefield study and retractions were published by most of the co-authors, many people continue to believe and base decisions on the study as it still lingers in their memory. Studies and research are being conducted to determine effective ways to correct [[misinformation]] in the [[public memory]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Pluviano S, Watt C, Della Sala S | title = Misinformation lingers in memory: Failure of three pro-vaccination strategies | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 12 | issue = 7 | pages = e0181640 | date = 27 July 2017 | pmid = 28749996 | pmc = 5547702 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0181640 | bibcode = 2017PLoSO..1281640P | doi-access = free }}</ref>

==Routes of administration==
{{see also|Vaccination schedule}}
A vaccine administration may be oral, by injection (intramuscular, intradermal, subcutaneous), by puncture, [[transdermal]] or intranasal.<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Plotkin SA | title = Mass Vaccination: Global Aspects – Progress and Obstacles (Current Topics in Microbiology & Immunology) | publisher = Springer-Verlag Berlin and Heidelberg GmbH & Co. K | year = 2006 | isbn = 978-3-540-29382-8 }}</ref> Several recent clinical trials have aimed to deliver the vaccines via mucosal surfaces to be up-taken by the [[Mucosal immunology|common mucosal immunity system]], thus avoiding the need for injections.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Fujkuyama Y, Tokuhara D, Kataoka K, Gilbert RS, McGhee JR, Yuki Y, Kiyono H, Fujihashi K | title = Novel vaccine development strategies for inducing mucosal immunity | journal = Expert Review of Vaccines | volume = 11 | issue = 3 | pages = 367–79 | date = March 2012 | pmid = 22380827 | pmc = 3315788 | doi = 10.1586/erv.11.196 }}</ref>

== Economics of vaccination ==
Health is often used as one of the metrics for determining the economic prosperity of a country. This is because healthier individuals are generally better suited to contributing to the economic development of a country than the sick.<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite journal | vauthors = Quilici S, Smith R, Signorelli C | title = Role of vaccination in economic growth | journal = Journal of Market Access & Health Policy | volume = 3 | pages = 27044 | date = 12 August 2015 | pmid = 27123174 | pmc = 4802686 | doi = 10.3402/jmahp.v3.27044 }}</ref> There are many reasons for this. For instance, a person who is vaccinated for influenza not only protects themselves from the risk of [[influenza]], but simultaneously also prevents themselves from infecting those around them.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|date=10 December 2003|title=Financing Vaccines in the 21st Century|url=https://www.nap.edu/read/10782/chapter/2#10|doi=10.17226/10782|pmid=25057673|isbn=978-0-309-08979-1 |author1 =Institute of Medicine | author2 =Board on Health Care Services |author3 = Committee on the Evaluation of Vaccine Purchase Financing in the United States}}</ref> This leads to a healthier society, which allows individuals to be more economically productive. Children are consequently able to attend school more often and have been shown to do better academically. Similarly, adults are able to work more often, more efficiently, and more effectively.<ref name="ReferenceA"/><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://econlife.com/2015/02/economic-positive-externalities-of-vaccination/|title=The Economic Side of Vaccines' Positive Externalities|date=24 February 2015|work=Econlife|access-date=7 September 2018}}</ref>

=== Costs and benefits ===

On the whole, vaccinations induce a net benefit to society. Vaccines are often noted for their high [[Return on investment]] (ROI) values, especially when considering the long-term effects.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Carroll S, Rojas AJ, Glenngård AH, Marin C | title = Vaccination: short- to long-term benefits from investment | journal = Journal of Market Access & Health Policy | volume = 3 | pages = 27279 | date = 12 August 2015 | pmid = 27123171 | pmc = 4802682 | doi = 10.3402/jmahp.v3.27279 }}</ref> Some vaccines have much higher ROI values than others. Studies have shown that the ratios of vaccination benefits to costs can differ substantially—from 27:1 for diphtheria/pertussis, to 13.5:1 for measles, 4.76:1 for varicella, and 0.68–1.1 : 1 for pneumococcal conjugate.<ref name=":0" /> Some governments choose to subsidize the costs of vaccines, due to some of the high ROI values attributed to vaccinations. The United States subsidizes over half of all vaccines for children, which costs between $400 and $600 each. Although most children do get vaccinated, the adult population of the USA is still below the recommended immunization levels. Many factors can be attributed to this issue. Many adults who have other health conditions are unable to be safely immunized, whereas others opt not to be immunized for the sake of private financial benefits. Many Americans are underinsured, and, as such, are required to pay for vaccines out-of-pocket. Others are responsible for paying high deductibles and co-pays. Although vaccinations usually induce long-term economic benefits, many governments struggle to pay the high short-term costs associated with labor and production. Consequently, many countries neglect to provide such services.<ref name=":0" />

They estimated that it would cost between $2.8&nbsp;billion and $3.7&nbsp;billion to develop at least one vaccine for each of them. This should be set against the potential cost of an outbreak.

[[Game theory]] uses [[Utility|utility functions]] to model costs and benefits, which may include financial and non-financial costs and benefits.  In recent years, it has been argued that game theory can effectively be used to model vaccine uptake in societies. Researchers have used game theory for this purpose to analyse vaccination uptake in the context of diseases such as influenza and measles.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Chang SL, Piraveenan M, Pattison P, Prokopenko M | title = Game theoretic modelling of infectious disease dynamics and intervention methods: a review | journal = Journal of Biological Dynamics | volume = 14 | issue = 1 | pages = 57–89 | date = December 2020 | pmid = 31996099 | doi = 10.1080/17513758.2020.1720322 | s2cid = 58004680 | arxiv = 1901.04143 }}</ref>
