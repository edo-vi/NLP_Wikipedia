'''Human presence in space''' is about '''humanity in space''', particularly about all '''anthropogenic presence in space''' and '''human activity in space''', that is in [[outer space]] and in a broader sense also on any [[wikt:extraterrestrial|extraterrestrial]] [[astronomical body]].

Humans have been present in space either, in the common sense, through their direct presence and activity like [[human spaceflight]], or through mediation of their presence and activity like with [[uncrewed spaceflight]], making "[[telepresence]]" possible.<ref name="Presence">{{Cite journal|title=Achieving Human Presence in Space Exploration|journal=[[Presence: Teleoperators & Virtual Environments]]|date=November 2013|author=Dan Lester|publisher=MIT Press|url=https://doi.org/10.1162/PRES_a_00160|volume=22|issue=4|pages=345–349|doi=10.1162/PRES_a_00160|s2cid=41221956}}</ref> Human presence in space, particularly through mediation, can take many physical forms from [[space debris]], [[uncrewed spacecraft]], [[artificial satellites]], [[space observatories]], [[crewed spacecraft]], [[Space art#Art in space|art in space]], to [[human outpost]]s in outer space such as [[space station]]s.

Human presence in space is realized and sustained through the advancement and application of [[space science]]s, particularly [[astronautics]] in the form of [[spaceflight]] and [[space infrastructure]].

Humans have achieved some mediated presence throughout the [[Solar System]], but the most extensive presence has been in [[Geocentric orbit|orbit around Earth]].  Humans have sustained direct presence in orbit around Earth since the year 2000 through continuously crewing the [[ISS]], and with few interruptions through crewing the space station [[Mir]] since the later 1980s.<ref name="Station">{{Cite web|title=The International Space Station Has Been Continuously Inhabited for Ten Years Today|author=Rebecca Boyle|date=2 November 2010|url=https://www.popsci.com/science/article/2010-11/happy-anniversary-international-space-station/|website=Popular Science|access-date=18 November 2020}}</ref> The increasing and extensive human presence in orbital space around Earth, beside its benefits, has also produced a threat to it by carrying with it [[space debris]], potentially cascading into the so-called [[Kessler syndrome]].<ref name="Kessler" /> This has raised the need for [[Space traffic management|regulation and mitigation of such]] to secure a [[Space sustainability|sustainable access to outer space]].

Securing the access to space and human presence in space has been pursued and allowed by the establishment of [[space law]] and [[space industry]], creating a [[space infrastructure]]. But sustainability has remained a challenging goal, with the [[United Nations]] seeing the need to advance long-term [[Space sustainability|sustainability of outer space]] activities in space science and application,<ref name="UN" /> and the [[United States]] having it as a crucial goal of its contemporary [[space policy]] and [[space program]].<ref name="NASA_sustainability" /><ref name="Artemis" />

The United States has been using the term "''human presence''" to identify one of the long-term goals of its space program and its international cooperation.<ref name="Presence" /><ref name="Bartels 2018" /> While it traditionally means and is used to name direct human presence, it is also used for mediated presence.<ref name="Presence" /> Differentiating human presence in space between direct and mediated human presence, meaning human or non-human presence, such as with [[crewed spacecraft|crewed]] or [[uncrewed spacecraft]], is rooted in a history of how human presence is to be understood (see [[#Study and reception|dedicated chapter]]).

Human, particularly direct, presence in space is sometimes replaced with "boots on the ground"<ref name="Presence" /> or equated with [[space colonization]].

Human presence in space, that is in [[outer space]], above [[Earth's atmosphere]], began with the first launches of [[artificial object]]s into outer space in the mid 20th century.

Since then the activity and presence in outer space has increased to the point where Earth is orbited by a vast number of artificial objects and the far reaches of the Solar System have been visited and explored by a range of space probes. Human presence throughout the Solar System is continued by different contemporary and future missions, most of them mediating human presence through [[robotic spaceflight]].

First a realized project of the [[Soviet Union]] and followed in competition by the [[United States]], human presence in space is now an increasingly international and [[commercial use of space|commercial field]].

== Representation and participation ==
{{See also|Politics of outer space}}
Participation and representation of humanity in space is an issue of human access to and presence in space ever since the beginning of [[spaceflight]].<ref name="Durrani" /> Different [[space agency|space agencies]], [[space program]]s and interest groups such as the [[International Astronomical Union]] have been formed supporting or producing humanity's or a particular human presence in space. Representation has been shaped by the inclusiveness, scope and [[Spaceflight#Spacefaring|varying capabilities of these]] organizations and programs.

Some rights of non-spacefaring countries to partake in spaceflight have been secured through international [[space law]], declaring space the "[[Common heritage of mankind|province of all mankind]]", understanding spaceflight as its resource, though sharing of space for all humanity is still criticized as [[imperialism|imperialist]] and lacking,<ref name="Durrani">{{Cite magazine |author=Haris Durrani |date=19 July 2019 |title=Is Spaceflight Colonialism? |url=https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/apollo-space-lunar-rockets-colonialism/ |magazine=The Nation |access-date=18 November 2020}}</ref><ref name="Bartels 2018" /> particularly regarding regulation of private spceflight.<ref name="Wheeling 2019">{{Cite web | last=Wheeling | first=Kate | title=Outer Space Treaties Didn't Anticipate the Privatization of Space Travel.

Space activity is legally based on the [[Outer Space Treaty]], the main international treaty. Though there are other international agreements such as the significantly less ratified [[Moon Treaty]].

The Outer Space Treaty established the basic ramifications for space activity in article one:
"''The exploration and use of outer space, including the Moon and other celestial bodies, shall be carried out for the benefit and in the interests of all countries, irrespective of their degree of economic or scientific development, and shall be the province of all mankind.''"

And continued in article two by stating:
"''Outer space, including the Moon and other celestial bodies, is not subject to national appropriation by claim of sovereignty, by means of use or occupation, or by any other means.''"<ref name=unoda>{{Cite web |url=http://disarmament.un.org/treaties/t/outer_space  | title = Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies  | accessdate = 18 November 2020 | publisher= [[United Nations Office for Disarmament Affairs]]}}</ref>

The development of international space law has revolved much around outer space being defined as ''common heritage of mankind''. The ''Magna Carta of Space'' presented by William A. Hyman in 1966 framed outer space explicitly  not as ''[[terra nullius]]'' but as ''[[res communis]]'', which subsequently influenced the work of the [[United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space]] (COPUOS).<ref name="Durrani" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://blogs.bl.uk/digitisedmanuscripts/2015/06/space-the-final-frontier.html|author=Alexander Lock|website=The [[British Library]] – Medieval manuscripts blog|title=Space: The Final Frontier|date=6 June 2015|access-date=18 November 2020}}</ref>

The [[United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs]] and the [[International Telecommunication Union]] are international organizations central for facilitating space regulation, such as [[space traffic management]].

Humans have been producing a range of [[radiation]] which has reached space unintentionally as well as intentionally, well before any direct human presence in space.
[[Electromagnetic radiation]] such as light, of humans, has been reaching even stars as far away as the age of the radiation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.planetary.org/articles/3390|date=24 February 2012|access-date=20 January 2021|author=Emily Lakdawalla|title=This is how far human radio broadcasts have reached into the galaxy}}</ref>

Beginning in the 20th century, humans have been sending radiation significantly into space. [[Nuclear explosion]]s, especially [[high-altitude nuclear explosion|high-altitude ones]] have since at times, starting with 1958, just a year after the first satellite Sputnik was launched, introduced strong and broad radiation from humans into space, producing [[electromagnetic pulse]]s and [[List of artificial radiation belts|orbital radiation belts]], adding to the explosion's destructive potential on ground and in orbit.

Space junk as product and form of human presence in space has existed ever since the first orbital spaceflights and comes mostly in the form of space debris in outer space.

{{Main|Robotic spaceflight|List of active Solar System probes|Timeline of artificial satellites and space probes|List of Solar System probes}}

Human presence in space has been strongly based on the many [[robotic spacecraft]], particularly as the many [[artificial satellite]]s in orbit around Earth.

Many firsts of human presence in space have been achieved by robotic missions. The first artificial object to reach space, above the 100&nbsp;km altitude [[Kármán line]], and therefore performing the first [[sub-orbital flight]] was [[MW 18014]] in 1944. But the first sustained presence in space was established by the [[orbital flight]] of [[Sputnik]] in 1957. Followed by a rich number of robotic [[space probe]]s achieving human presence and exploration throughout the Solar system for the first time.

Human presence at the Moon was established by the [[Luna programme]] starting in 1959, with despite loosing contact a first [[Flyby (spaceflight)|flyby]] and [[heliocentric orbit]] ([[Luna 1]]), a first arrival of an artificial object on the surface with an [[Impactor (spacecraft)|impactor]] ([[Luna 2]]), and a for the first time a successful flight to the [[far side of the Moon]] ([[Luna 3]]). The Moon then was in 1966 visited for the first time by a [[Lander (spacecraft)|lander]] ([[Luna 9]]), as well as an [[orbiter]] ([[Luna 10]]), and in 1970 for the first time a [[Rover (space exploration)|rover]] ([[Lunokhod 1]]) landed on an extraterrestrial body.
[[Interplanetary spaceflight|Interplanetary presence]] was established at Venus by the [[Venera program]], with a [[Venera 1|flyby in 1961 (Venera 1)]] and [[Venera 3|a crash in 1966 (Venera 3)]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/beyond-earth-tagged.pdf|title=Beyond Earth: A Chronicle of Deep Space Exploration, 1958–2016|page=1|last1=Siddiqi|first1=Asif A.|lccn=2017059404|isbn=978-1-62683-042-4|publisher=NASA History Program Office|edition=second|year=2018|id=SP2018-4041|series=The NASA history series|location=Washington, DC}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraft/display.action?id=1965-092A |title=Venera 3 |website=NASA Space Science Data Coordinated Archive}}</ref>

=== Direct human presence in space ===
{{See also|Human spaceflight|Women in space|Astronaut|Spaceflight participant|List of human spaceflights|List of space travelers by name}}
[[File:Tracy Caldwell Dyson in Cupola ISS.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|[[International Space Station]] crewmember [[Tracy Caldwell Dyson]] views the Earth, 2010.]]
Direct human presence in space was achieved with [[Yuri Gagarin]] flying a [[space capsule]] in 1961 for one orbit around Earth for the first time. While direct human presence in open space, by exiting a spacecraft in a [[spacesuit]], a so-called [[extravehicular activity]], has been achieved since the first person to do so, [[Alexei Leonov]], in 1965.

Though [[Valentina Tereshkova]] was in 1963 the first woman in space, women saw no further presence in space until the 1980s and are still underrepresented, e.g. with no women ever being present on the Moon.<ref name="10percent" /> An internationalization of direct human presence in space started with the first [[space rendezvous]] of two crews of different [[human spaceflight programs]], the [[Apollo–Soyuz]] mission in 1975 and at the end of the 1970s with the [[Interkosmos]] program.

[[Space station]]s have harboured so far the only long-duration direct human presence in space. After the first station [[Salyut 1]] (1971) and its tragic [[Soyuz 11]] crew, space stations have been operated consecutively since [[Skylab]] (1973), having allowed a progression of long-duration direct human presence in space. Long-duration direct human presence has been joined by visiting crews since 1977 ([[Salyut 6]]). Consecutive direct human presence in space has been achieved since the [[Salyut program|Salyut]] successor [[Mir]] by 1987. Uninterrupted direct human presence in space has been achieved since the operational transition from the Mir to the [[ISS]], with its first occupation in 2000.<ref name="Station" />

Beyond Earth the Moon has been the only astronomical object which so far has seen direct human presence through the week long [[Apollo program|Apollo missions]] between 1968 and 1972, beginning with the first orbit by [[Apollo 8]] in 1968 and with the first landing by [[Apollo 11]] in 1969. The longest extraterrestrial human stay was three days by [[Apollo 17]].

While most persons who have been to space are [[Astronauts]], professional members of [[human spaceflight programs]], particularly governmental ones, the few others, starting in the 1980s, have been trained and gone to space as [[spaceflight participant]]s, with the first [[space tourist]] staying in space in 2001.

By the end of the 2010s several hundred people from more than [[Timeline of space travel by nationality|40 countries]] have gone into space, most of them reaching orbit. 24 people have [[List of lunar astronauts|traveled beyond low Earth orbit]] and 12 of them [[List of Apollo astronauts#People who have walked on the Moon|walked on the Moon]].<ref name="astronaut1">{{Cite web|url=https://www.worldspaceflight.com/bios/stats.php|title=Astronaut/Cosmonaut Statistics|website=www.worldspaceflight.com|access-date=2019-12-03}}</ref>

A permanent human presence in space depends on an established space infrastructure which harbours, supplies and maintains human presence. Such [[infrastructure]] has originally been Earth [[Ground segment|ground-based]], but with increased numbers of [[satellite]]s and long-duration missions beyond the [[near side of the Moon]] space-to-space based infrastructure is being used. First simple interplanetary infrastructures have been created by [[space probe]]s particularly when employing a system which combines a [[Lander (spacecraft)|lander]] and a relaying [[orbiter]].

[[Space station]]s are [[space habitat (facility)|space habitats]] which have provided a crucial infrastructure for sustaining a continuous direct human, including non-human, presence in space. Space stations have been continuously present in orbit around Earth from [[Skylab]] in 1973, to the [[Salyut programme|Salyut stations]], [[Mir]] and eventually [[ISS]].
The planned [[Artemis program]] includes the [[Lunar Gateway]] a future space station around the Moon as a multimission waystation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://spacenews.com/op-ed-nasa-must-shift-its-focus-to-infrastructure-and-capabilities-that-support-dynamic-missions/|author=Greg Autry|date=22 August 2019|title=NASA must shift its focus to infrastructure and capabilities that support dynamic missions|publisher=[[SpaceNews]]|access-date=25 November 2020}}</ref>

Human presence has also been expressed through spiritual and artistic installations in outer space or [[Moon#Human impact|on the Moon]].
[[Apollo 15]] Mission Commander [[David Scott]] left for example a Bible on their [[Lunar rover]] during an [[extravehicular activity]] on the Moon. Space has furthermore been the sight of people taking part in religious festivities such as [[Christmas on the International Space Station]].

[[List of missions to Mars|A group of missions]] have been present on Mars [[2001 Mars Odyssey|since 2001]], including continuous presence by a series of rovers [[Spirit (rover)|since 2003]].

Beside having reached some [[Planet#Planetary-mass objects|planetary-mass objects]] (that is [[planet]]s, [[dwarf planet]]s or the largest, so-called [[planetary-mass moon]]s), humans have also reached, landed and in some cases even returned robotic probes from some [[small Solar System body|small Solar System bodies]], like [[asteroid]]s and [[comet]]s, with a [[List of minor planets and comets visited by spacecraft|range of space probes]].

The Solar System region near the [[Sun]]'s [[Stellar corona|corona]], inside [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]]'s orbit, with its high [[gravitational potential]] difference from Earth and the subsequent high [[delta-v]] needed to reach it, has only been considerably pierced on highly [[elliptic orbit]]s by some [[List of Solar System probes#Solar probes|solar probes]] like [[Helios (spacecraft)|Helios 1 & 2]], as well as the more contemporary [[Parker Solar Probe]]. The latter being the closest to reach the Sun, breaking speed records with its very low solar altitudes at [[Apsis#Perihelion and aphelion|perihelion apsis]].

Future direct human presence beyond Earth's orbit is possibly going to be re-introduced if current plans for crewed [[research station]]s to be established [[Human mission to Mars|on Mars]] and [[Moonbase|on the Moon]] are continued to be developed.

Human presence in [[Geocentric orbit|Earth orbit]] and [[heliocentric orbit]] has been the case with a [[List of artificial objects in heliocentric orbit|range of artificial objects]] since the beginning of spaceflight (both possibly with debris since 1957,<ref name="IdeaMan" /> but for sure since 1958 with [[Sputnik 1]] and in 1959 with [[Luna 1]] respectively), and at more [[interplanetary spaceflight|interplanetary heliocentric orbits]] since 1961 with [[Venera 1]]. [[Orbital insertion|Extraterrestrial orbit]]s other than heliocentric orbit has been achieved since 1966, starting with [[Luna 10]] around the Moon and several at the same time in orbit of the Moon that same year starting with [[Lunar Orbiter 1]], and since 1971 with [[Mariner 9]] around another planet (Mars).

Humans have also used and occupied [[co-orbital configuration]]s, [[List of objects at Lagrange points|particularly at different liberation points]] with [[halo orbit]]s, to harness the benefits of those so called [[Lagrange point]]s.

Some interplanetary missions, particularly the ''[[Ulysses (spacecraft)|Ulysses]]'' solar polar probe and considerably ''[[Voyager 1]]'' and ''[[Voyager2|2]]'', as well as others like ''[[Pioneer 10]]'' and ''[[Pioneer 11|11]]'', have entered trajectories taking them out of the [[Ecliptic#Plane of the Solar System|ecliptic plane]].

Individually or as a society humans have engaged since [[pre-history]] in developing their perception of space above the ground, or the [[Cosmology|cosmos at large]], and developing their place in it.

[[Social sciences]] have been studying such works of people from pre-history to the contemporary with the fields of [[archaeoastronomy]] to [[cultural astronomy]]. With actual human activity and presence in space the need for fields like [[astrosociology]] and [[space archaeology]] have been added.

=== Human presence observed from space ===
{{Main|Earth observation|Overview effect|Timeline of first images of Earth from space|Extraterrestrial sky#Earth from Mars|Earth in culture|Space selfie}}

[[File:Earth and Moon from Mars PIA04531.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Earth and Moon from Mars, imaged by [[Mars Global Surveyor]] on May 8, 2003, 13:00 [[UTC]]. South America is visible.]]

[[Earth observation]] has been one of the first missions of spaceflight, resulting in a dense contemporary presence of [[Earth observation satellite]]s, having a wealth of uses and benefits for life on Earth.

Viewing human presence from space, particularly by humans directly, has been reported by some astronauts to cause a [[cognitive shift]] in perception, especially while viewing the Earth from outer space, this effect has been called the [[overview effect]].

=== Observation of space from space ===
{{Main|Space observatory|List of space telescopes}}

Parallel to the above ''overview effect'' the term "ultraview effect" has been introduced for a subjective response of intense awe some astronauts have experienced viewing large "starfields" while in space.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Weibel |first1=Deana|date=13 August 2020 |title=The Overview Effect and the Ultraview Effect: How Extreme Experiences in/of Outer Space Influence Religious Beliefs in Astronauts|journal=Religions|volume=11|issue=8|pages=418|doi=10.3390/rel11080418|s2cid=225477388|doi-access=free}}</ref>

Related to the long discussion of what human presence constitutes and how it should be lived, the discussion about direct (e.g. [[crewed spacecraft|crewed]]) and mediated (e.g. [[Uncrewed spacecraft|uncrewed]]) human presence, has been decisive for how [[space policy]] makers have chosen human presence and its purposes.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=A robotics perspective on human spaceflight|author=Alex Ellery|date=1999|journal=Earth, Moon, and Planets|volume=87|issue=3|pages=173–190|publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers|doi=10.1023/A:1013190908003|bibcode=1999EM&P...87..173E|s2cid=116182207|url=https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1013190908003|access-date=25 November 2020}}</ref>

The relevance of this issue for space policy has risen with the advancement and resulting possibilities of [[telerobotics]],<ref name="Presence" /> to the point where most of the human presence in space has been reallized robotically, leaving direct human presence behind.

=== Localization in space ===
{{Main|Location of Earth|Solar System#Galactic context|History of the center of the Universe}}

The location of human presence has been studied throughout history by astronomy and was significant in order to relate to the heavens, that is to [[outer space]] and its bodies.

The historic argument between [[geocentrism]] and [[heliocentrism]] is one example about the location of human presence.

Realizations of the [[Location of Earth|scales of space]], have been taken as subject to discuss human and life's existence or relations to [[spacetime|space and time]] beyond them, with some understanding humanity's or life's presence as a [[Rare Earth hypothesis|singularity]] or one to be in [[Uncontacted peoples|isolation]], pondering on the [[Fermi paradox]].

A diverse range of arguments of how to relate to space beyond human presence have been raised, with some seeing space beyond humans as reason to venture out into space and exploring it, some aiming for [[first contact (anthropology)|contact]] with [[extraterrestrial life]], to arguments for [[planetary protection|protection of humanity or life]] from its possibilities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/news/2018/03/stephen-hawking-controversial-physics-black-holes-bets-science/|title=Stephen Hawking's Most Provocative Moments, From Evil Aliens to Black Hole Wagers|date=2 May 2018|author=Michael Greshko|publisher=[[National Geographic]]|access-date=25 November 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/searching-life-beyond-earth-scientists-debate-danger-messages-hostile-aliens-10078189.html|title=Searching for life beyond Earth: Scientists debate danger of messages to 'hostile' aliens|date=1 March 2015|author=Joel Achenbach|work=[[The Independent]]|access-date=25 November 2020}}</ref>

Space and human presence in it has been the subject of different agendas.

Human presence in space at its beginnings, was fueled by the [[Cold War]] and its outgrowing the [[Space Race]]. During this time [[space technology|technological]], nationalist, ideological and [[Militarization of space|military competition]] were dominant driving factors of [[space policy]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nationalcoldwarexhibition.org/schools-colleges/national-curriculum/space-race/|website=National Cold War Exhibition|title=Space Race|publisher=Royal Air Force Museum|date=2013|access-date=24 November 2020}}</ref> and the resulting activity and, particularly direct human, presence in space.

With the waning of the Space Race, concluded by [[Apollo–Soyuz|cooperation in human spaceflight]], focus shifted in the 1970s further to [[space exploration]] and [[telerobotics]], having a range of achievements and technological advances.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Robots and humans in space flight: Technology, evolution, and interplanetary travel|journal=Technology in Society|volume=29|date=2007|pages=271–282|doi=10.1016/j.techsoc.2007.04.007|publisher=Elsevier Ltd.|first1=Roger|last1=Launiusa|first2=Howard|last2=McCurdyb|issue=3}}</ref> Space exploration meant by then also an engagement by governments in the [[search for extraterrestrial life]].

Since human activity and presence in space has been producing [[Benefits of space exploration|spin-off benefits]], other than for the above purposes, such as [[Earth observation satellite|Earth observation]] and [[communication satellite]]s for civilian use, international cooperation to advance such benefits of human presence in space grew with time.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Fundamentals of Space Business and Economics|last=Gurtuna|first=Ozgur|publisher=Springer|year=2013|isbn=978-1-4614-6695-6|location=Springer New York Heidelberg Dordrecht London|pages=31|doi=10.1007/978-1-4614-6696-3|series=SpringerBriefs in Space Development|bibcode=2013fsbe.book.....G }}</ref> Particularly for the purpose of continuing benefits of [[space infrastructure]] and [[space science]] the United Nations has been pushing for safeguarding [[Space sustainability|human activity in outer space in a sustainable way]].<ref name="UN" />

With the contemporary so-called [[NewSpace]], the aim of [[commercialization of space]] has grown along with a narrative of [[space habitation]] for the [[Space and survival|survival of some humans away from and without Earth]], which in turn has been critically analyzed and highlighted [[Space colonization#Colonialism|colonialist purposes]] for human activity and presence in space.<ref>{{Cite web |author=Joon Yun |website=Worth.com |title=The Problem With Today's Ideas About Space Exploration. |date=January 2, 2020
