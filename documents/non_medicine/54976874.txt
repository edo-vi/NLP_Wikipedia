'''Infectious tolerance''' is a term referring to a phenomenon where a tolerance-inducing state is transferred from one cell population to another. It can be induced in many ways; although it is often artificially induced, it is a natural ''in vivo'' process.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Cobbold|first1=S.|last2=Waldmann|first2=H.|date=October 1998|title=Infectious tolerance|journal=Current Opinion in Immunology|volume=10|issue=5|pages=518–524|issn=0952-7915|pmid=9794831|doi=10.1016/S0952-7915(98)80217-3}}</ref> A number of research deal with the development of a strategy utilizing this phenomenon in transplantation immunology.

== History ==
The term "infectious tolerance" was originally used by Gershon and Kondo in 1970<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Gershon|first1=R.

Later developed new tolerogenic strategies have provided strong evidence to re-evaluate the phenomenon of T cell mediated suppression, in particular the use of non-depleting anti-CD4 monoclonal antibodies, demonstrating that neither [[thymus]] nor [[clonal deletion]] is necessary to induce tolerance.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Qin|first1=S.

== Mechanisms ==
[[File:Immunoregulation by regulatory T cells (Treg)..jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Treg migrate to the grafted tissue. Activated Treg convert ATP released by inflamed tissues to adenosine via the ectoenzymes CD39 and CD73. Local adenosine could contribute to the initial “privileged” microenvironment. Treg also secrete TGF-β and IL-10 which inhibit the maturation and migration of dendritic cells (DC). These “decommissioned” DC can secrete catabolic enzymes for depletion of essential amino acids (EAA) and, therefore, induce apoptosis of effector T cells. Moreover, the “privileged” tissues could release pro-apoptotic galectin-9 which binds to TIM-3 expressed by effector T cells such as Th1 and Th17. This further amplifies the immunosuppressive microenvironment. Each of these components within the graft can further reinforce the local anti-inflammatory state such that any naive T cell, migrating into this area, will be converted to induced Treg (iTreg) through infectious tolerance. The iTreg then expand and further suppress immunity in the “privileged” microenvironment.]]
During a tolerant state potential effector cells remain but are tightly regulated by induced antigen-specific CD4+ [[regulatory T cell]]s (iTregs). Many subsets of iTregs play a part in this process, but CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup>FoxP3<sup>+</sup> Tregs play a key role, because they have the ability to convert conventional T cells into iTregs directly by secretion of the suppressive cytokines [[Transforming growth factor beta|TGF-β]], [[IL-10 family|IL-10]] or [[Interleukin 35|IL-35]], or indirectly via [[Dendritic cell|dendritic cells (DCs)]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Gravano|first1=David M.|last2=Vignali|first2=Dario A.A.|date=June 2012|title=The Battle Against Immunopathology: Infectious Tolerance Mediated by Regulatory T Cells|journal=Cellular and Molecular Life Sciences|volume=69|issue=12|pages=1997–2008|doi=10.1007/s00018-011-0907-z|issn=1420-682X|pmc=3353028|pmid=22205213}}</ref> Production of IL-10 induces the formation of another population of regulatory T cells called Tr1.
