The '''2017–18 NCAA Division I men's basketball corruption scandal''' was a [[corruption]] scandal, initially involving sportswear manufacturer [[Adidas]] as well as several [[college basketball]] programs associated with the brand<ref name="espn-schlabach">{{cite news|url=http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/20834050/the-story-how-fbi-brought-words-corruption |title=The step-by-step process of how the words 'corruption' and 'fraud' came to college basketball |last=Schlabach|first=Mark |work=[[ESPN]] |date=September 27, 2017 |access-date=September 28, 2017}}</ref><ref name="nbcnews">{{cite news |url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/college-basketball-coaches-allegedly-took-bribes-agents-deliver-athletes-n804781|title=4 NCAA Basketball Coaches, Adidas Executive Charged in Bribe Scheme |last1=Winter |first1=Tom |last2=Connor |first2=Tracy |work=[[NBC News]]|date=September 26, 2017 |access-date=September 28, 2017}}</ref><ref name="sbnation">{{cite news |url=https://www.sbnation.com/college-basketball/2017/9/27/16366056/college-basketball-scandal-corruption-fbi |title=The FBI's investigation of college basketball corruption, explained |last=Lyles |first=Harry Jr. |publisher=[[SB Nation]] |date=September 27, 2017 |access-date=September 28, 2017}}</ref> but now involving many programs not affiliated with Adidas.<ref name="Yahoo 2-23">{{cite news|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/exclusive-federal-documents-detail-sweeping-potential-ncaa-violations-involving-high-profile-players-schools-103338484.html |title=Exclusive: Federal documents detail sweeping potential NCAA violations involving high-profile players, schools |first1=Pat |last1=Forde |first2=Pete |last2=Thamel |author1-link=Pat Forde |author2-link=Pete Thamel |work=[[Yahoo!

On September 27, 2017, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] and the office of the [[United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York]] announced the arrest of 10 individuals, including assistant coaches Anthony Bland, [[Chuck Person]], [[Emanuel Richardson]], and [[2017–18 Oklahoma State Cowboys basketball team|Lamont Evans]] and Adidas executive James Gatto, on various corruption and [[fraud]] charges including [[bribery]], [[money laundering]], and [[wire fraud]].<ref name="espn-schlabach"/><ref name="nbcnews"/><ref name="sbnation"/> The schools implicated in the initial announcement were [[Arizona Wildcats men's basketball|Arizona]], [[Auburn Tigers men's basketball|Auburn]], [[Louisville Cardinals men's basketball|Louisville]], [[Miami Hurricanes men's basketball|Miami]], [[Oklahoma State Cowboys men's basketball|Oklahoma State]], [[South Carolina Gamecocks men's basketball|South Carolina]], and [[USC Trojans men's basketball|Southern California]] (USC).<ref name="espn-schlabach"/><ref name="nbcnews"/><ref name="sbnation"/> Richardson had a six-figure salary.

The investigation has since spread beyond the individuals and teams initially implicated.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.espn.com/espn/otl/story/_/id/21710106/louisville-athletic-director-tom-jurich-leveraged-big-deals-build-university-sports-powerhouse-only-watch-burn-amid-charges-excess |title=How a midlevel school became The University of Adidas at Louisville |date=December 10, 2017 |access-date=December 19, 2017 |website=ESPN |first1=Steve |last1=Fainaru |first2=Mark |last2=Fainaru-Wada}}</ref> Shortly afterwards, multiple media reports indicated that the [[Nike Elite Youth Basketball League|Elite Youth Basketball League]], the grassroots basketball division of [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], was served with a [[subpoena]] by federal investigators. While Nike was not named in the initial documents, one of the 10 individuals arrested on September 26 was a former Nike executive who was working for Adidas when he was arrested.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/report-nike-grassroots-basketball-division-served-with-subpoena-by-federal-agents/ |title=Report: Nike grassroots basketball division served with subpoena by federal agents |first=Kyle |last=Boone |website=[[CBS Sports]] |date=September 28, 2017 |access-date=October 2, 2017}}</ref>

On February 23, 2018, [[Yahoo!

== Background ==
The discovery of corruption in basketball stemmed from an investigation of [[Pittsburgh]]-based financial planner Marty Blazer by the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC). In 2016, the SEC charged Blazer with wire fraud and accused him of [[Embezzlement|embezzling]] over $2 million from several professional athletes to invest in movie projects and finance [[Ponzi scheme]]s. As part of a [[Plea bargaining|plea agreement]] with the Southern District U.S. Attorney's office, he agreed to become an FBI informant, and would later plead guilty to reduced charges.<ref name="espn-schlabach"/> He has since stated that there were also payments made to players in efforts to attend the Penn State football program.

=== First wave ===
==== Arizona ====
[[Emanuel Richardson|Emanuel "Book" Richardson]], an Arizona assistant since 2009, was among the individuals arrested and indicted in 2017. He was alleged to have met with agent Christian Dawkins and others in June 2017, agreeing to accept a $5,000 bribe to steer Arizona players to Dawkins' sports management company,<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.azcentral.com/story/sports/ncaab/ua/2017/11/08/arizona-wildcats-assistant-coach-book-richardson-indicted-charges-ncaa-fbi-bribery-investigation/844104001/ |title=Arizona assistant coach Book Richardson indicted on charges tied to NCAA bribery investigation |first=Anne |last=Ryman |newspaper=[[The Arizona Republic]] |location=[[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] |date=November 8, 2017 |access-date=February 24, 2017}}</ref> and he was also charged with accepting an additional $15,000 in bribes and paying at least one recruit to commit to the university.<ref name=Schmidt>{{cite news |url=http://tucson.com/sports/arizonawildcats/basketball/ua-fires-assistant-basketball-coach-book-richardson-after-his-appeal/article_d22368ae-005e-11e8-9c31-4bdff6aac439.html |title=UA fires assistant basketball coach Book Richardson after his appeal fails |first=Caitlin |last=Schmidt |newspaper=[[Arizona Daily Star]] |location=[[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson, AZ]] |date=January 23, 2018 |access-date=February 24, 2018}}</ref> Richardson was suspended on September 26, the day after his arrest, and formally fired on January 23, 2018.<ref name=Schmidt/>

Arizona lost one of its three-member 2018 recruiting class in the wake of the initial allegations. Five-star point guard [[Jahvon Quinerly]] reopened his recruitment in October and eventually signed with [[Villanova Wildcats men's basketball|Villanova]].<ref name="Williams decommit">{{cite news |url=http://www.espn.com/college-sports/recruiting/basketball/mens/story/_/id/22626040/class-2018-espn-100-point-guard-brandon-williams-decommits-arizona-wildcats |title=PG Brandon Williams becomes third player to decommit from Arizona |first=Jeff |last=Borzello |website=ESPN |date=March 2, 2018 |access-date=March 3, 2018}}</ref> [[Nassir Little]], also a [[Star (classification)|five-star]] recruit, cited the investigation as his reason for deciding against attending Arizona.<ref name="Nassir Little picks UNC">{{cite news|url=http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/20916374/five-star-prospect-nassir-little-commits-north-carolina-tar-heels |title=Five-star prospect Nassir Little, No. 14 in ESPN 100, picks UNC |first=Jeff |last=Borzello |website=ESPN |date=October 5, 2018 |access-date=October 16, 2018}}</ref> On a wiretap that was played during the trial, Merl Code claims that Arizona offered $150,000 for Little.<ref name="College Basketball Corruption Trial">{{cite news|url=https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/college-basketball-corruption-trial-payments-for-kansas-players-and-to-ex-nc-state-assistant-detailed-by-witness/ |title=College Basketball Corruption Trial |first=Matt |last=Norlander |website=CBS Sports|date=October 11, 2018 |access-date=October 16, 2018}}</ref>

==== Auburn ====
[[Chuck Person]], a former Auburn basketball star who went on to a long [[National Basketball Association]] career before going into coaching, was alleged by the FBI to have received over $90,000 in bribes from Rashan Michel, a former NBA and [[Southeastern Conference]] referee who ran a custom tailoring shop in [[Atlanta]] that had many professional athletes as clients. Person was accused of paying nearly $20,000 to the families of two active Auburn players.<ref name="espn-schlabach"/> Auburn suspended Person without pay shortly after his arrest.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.sportingnews.com/ncaa-basketball/news/chuck-person-auburn-basketball-suspended-ncaa-corruption-charges-adidas-recruits/1q3lk3eomafni1d1v1xxoe1ris |title=Auburn suspends Chuck Person without pay following arrest |first=Zac |last=Al-Khateeb |magazine=[[Sporting News]] |date=September 26, 2017 |access-date=October 2, 2017}}</ref> Person was indicted by a federal grand jury and subsequently fired by Auburn on November 7, 2017.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/college/auburn/2017/11/07/auburn-suspended-assistant-chuck-person-indicted-federal-grand-jury/842479001/ |title=Chuck Person indicted by federal grand jury, fired by Auburn |work=USA Today |date=November 7, 2017 |access-date=November 8, 2017 |language=en}}</ref> In the wake of the indictments, the university retained an outside law firm to launch an internal investigation into the program.<ref name="Pearl issues">{{cite news|url=http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/21342267/bruce-pearl-job-jeopardy-cooperate-auburn-internal-investigation |title=Sources: Bruce Pearl's job in jeopardy if he doesn't cooperate in Auburn investigation |first1=Mark |last1=Schlabach |first2=Paula |last2=Lavigne |author-link1=Mark Schlabach |work=[[ESPN]] |date=November 8, 2017 |access-date=November 10, 2017}}</ref>

Before Auburn's exhibition game on November 2, 2017, the school announced that it would hold players [[Austin Wiley]] and Danjel Purifoy out of games indefinitely due to eligibility concerns raised over the FBI investigation.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/auburn-holds-out-f-danjel-purifoy-and-c-austin-wiley-indefinitely-amid-fbi-investigation/ |title=Auburn holding out Danjel Purifoy and Austin Wiley indefinitely amid FBI probe |work=CBS Sports |access-date=November 2, 2017 |language=en}}</ref> They would both be held out of action throughout the rest of the season, though they returned to play after the conclusion of that season.

On November 8, ESPN reported that head coach [[Bruce Pearl]] refused to cooperate with the school's internal investigation, and that university officials notified him that the refusal could lead to his firing. The university had been unable to determine whether Pearl had been involved in any violations of law or [[NCAA]] rules because the FBI had seized his computers and cell phones as part of its investigation.<ref name="Pearl issues"/>

On the same day that the initial arrests were announced, E. J. Montgomery, a highly touted forward in the 2018 recruiting class who had verbally committed to Auburn in September 2016, announced he would reopen his recruitment.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.espn.com/college-sports/recruiting/basketball/mens/story/_/id/20835897/auburn-tigers-recruit-ej-montgomery-decommits |title=ESPN 100 recruit E.J.

==== Louisville ====
Louisville was not named directly in the court documents, but the documents mentioned a "University-6" that was "a public research university located in Kentucky" with "approximately 22,640 students and over 7,000 faculty and staff members", and fielding "approximately 21 varsity sports teams in NCAA Division I competition."<ref name=ODonnell>{{cite web |url=https://www.sbnation.com/college-basketball/2017/9/26/16367526/louisville-fbi-investigation-college-basketball-scandal-rick-pitino |title=Louisville basketball has an FBI investigation to worry about while still on NCAA probation |first=Ricky |last=O'Donnell |website=[[SB Nation]] |date=September 26, 2017 |access-date=October 2, 2017}}</ref> The state has only two public research universities—the [[University of Kentucky]] and the [[University of Louisville]]—and the details cited in the documents match only Louisville. Gregory Postel, Louisville's interim president, confirmed hours after the FBI announcements that the school was indeed "University-6".<ref name=Novelly>{{cite news|url=http://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/2017/09/26/university-louisville-college-basketball-fbi-sting/703414001/ |title=University of Louisville college basketball program targeted in FBI investigation |first=Thomas |last=Novelly |newspaper=[[The Courier-Journal]] |location=[[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville, KY]] |date=September 26, 2017 |access-date=October 2, 2017}}</ref> At the time of the announcement, the Louisville men's basketball program was facing major NCAA sanctions stemming from an [[2015 University of Louisville basketball sex scandal|earlier sex scandal]], which included vacating the 2013 national championship.<ref name=ODonnell/> The NCAA upheld those sanctions on February 20, 2018.

The documents also alluded to two Louisville coaches, identified only as "Coach-1" and "Coach-2", and a recruit who [[National Letter of Intent|signed]] with Louisville identified as "Player-10".<ref name="Gatto complaint U6">{{cite web |url=https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/press-release/file/999006/download |title=Complaint, ''United States v. James Gatto et al.'' |publisher=[[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York]] |pages=20–22 |access-date=October 2, 2017}}</ref> The documents allege that the coaches were involved in a scheme by which a "Company-1", later identified as Adidas, would funnel $100,000 to the family of "Player-10" in exchange for him coming to Louisville. About a month before the scandal broke, Louisville, which has been Adidas' flagship college athletic program since 2016, signed a 10-year, $160 million extension to its then-current apparel contract with the company.<ref name="espn-schlabach"/> The documents indicate that Brad Augustine, a youth basketball coach in Florida who was among the individuals arrested, said the following about "Coach-2":<ref name="Parrish Coach-2">{{cite news |url=https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/rick-pitino-identified-as-coach-2-mentioned-in-federal-court-documents/ |title=Rick Pitino identified as 'Coach-2' mentioned in federal court documents |first=Gary |last=Parrish |work=CBS Sports |date=September 28, 2017 |access-date=October 2, 2017}}</ref><blockquote>No one swings a bigger dick than Coach-2 at Company-1. . . .

[And then] they're taking care of us.<ref name="Gatto complaint U6"/></blockquote> The day after the complaints were unsealed, [[CBS News]], followed by many other media outlets, reported that "Coach-2" was Louisville head coach [[Rick Pitino]].<ref name="Parrish Coach-2"/> Shortly thereafter, media outlets identified "Player-10" as [[Brian Bowen]], a top recruit who had unexpectedly signed with Louisville on June 3, 2017.<ref name="Parrish Coach-2"/> Bowen most recently played for the [[Indiana Pacers]] on a two-way contract.

As a result of the scandal, on September 27, 2017, Louisville placed Pitino on unpaid [[administrative leave]] and [[athletic director]] [[Tom Jurich]] on paid administrative leave.<ref name="espn-pitino-jurich">{{cite news|url=http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/20834710/louisville-head-coach-rick-pitino-athletic-director-tom-jurich-put-leave|title=Louisville's Rick Pitino and Tom Jurich placed on administrative leave|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=September 27, 2017|access-date=September 28, 2017}}</ref> Bowen was suspended from the team and withheld from all team activities.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.sportingnews.com/ncaa-basketball/news/louisville-federal-charges-brian-bowen-suspension-cardinal-mens-basketball-rick-pitino/bl37wotnowv015u09k2hxk4ex |title=Brian Bowen, Louisville player implicated in indictment, reportedly suspended indefinitely |first=Skylar |last=Rolstad |magazine=Sporting News |date=September 28, 2017 |access-date=October 2, 2017}}</ref> In addition, two five-star high school recruits who had verbally committed to join the Louisville program in 2018–19, Anfernee Simons and Courtney Ramey, rescinded their commitments and reopened their recruitment.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.si.com/college-basketball/2017/09/27/louisville-recruiting-anfernee-simons-courtney-ramey |title=With Rick Pitino Out of the Picture, Louisville Loses Two Five-Stars from 2018 Recruiting Class |first=Chris |last=Johnson |magazine=[[Sports Illustrated]] |date=September 27, 2017 |access-date=October 2, 2017}}</ref> Simons would try his luck with entering the [[2018 NBA draft]] as a [[high school postgraduate]].

On October 6 the University of Louisville placed associate head coach Kenny Johnson and assistant coach Jordan Fair on paid administrative leave, and Fair would be fired by Louisville on October 11.

The Louisville athletics board officially voted to fire Pitino on October 16.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.si.com/college-basketball/2017/10/16/louisville-rick-pitino-fired |title=Louisville Head Coach Rick Pitino Officially Fired |first=Scooby |last=Axson |magazine=[[Sports Illustrated]] |date=October 16, 2017 |access-date=October 19, 2017}}</ref> Two days later, the university's board of trustees voted 10–3 to fire Jurich with cause.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.espn.com/college-sports/story/_/id/21068230/louisville-cardinals-fire-athletic-director-tom-jurich |title=Louisville fires athletic director Tom Jurich after scandal |first=Andrea |last=Adelson |publisher=ESPN |date=October 18, 2017 |access-date=October 18, 2017}}</ref>

On November 8, the Southern District unsealed a new set of indictments against eight of the 10 individuals initially charged. On the same day, [[NBC News]] reported that these new documents directly linked Pitino to the alleged scheme to pay Bowen's family. The documents allege that Pitino met in July 2017 with Christian Dawkins, an agent who was formally indicted in both September and November. During that meeting, Dawkins was said to have asked Pitino to call Gatto and request the $100,000 payment to Bowen's family, and Pitino reportedly agreed to make the call to Gatto. The FBI revealed that phone records indicated that Pitino called Gatto three times before Bowen committed to Louisville.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/sports/federal-bribery-indictments-unsealed-against-ncaa-coaches-n819156 |title=Federal Bribery Indictments Unsealed Against NCAA Coaches |first1=Tom |last1=Winter |first2=Phil |last2=McCasland |work=NBC News |date=November 8, 2017 |access-date=November 9, 2017}}</ref>

The April 2018 indictments specifically charge Dawkins and Adidas consultant Merl Code with conspiring with Gatto to commit wire fraud and pay the aforementioned $100,000 to Bowen's family.<ref name="Schlabach 4-10"/>

On May 18, 2018, the board of trustees agreed to a $4.5 million settlement with Jurich that cleared him of any wrongdoing and phrased his termination as "retirement".<ref>{{cite web |title=Louisville, ex-AD Tom Jurich reach $4.5M settlement |url=http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/23538395/university-louisville-reaches-45m-settlement-ex-ad-tom-jurich-firing |website=ESPN |date=May 18, 2018 |access-date=May 19, 2018}}</ref>

==== Miami ====
Like Louisville, the [[University of Miami]] was not directly identified in the court documents, but UM president [[Julio Frenk]] confirmed on September 27 that the school was the institution described in said documents as "University-7". The confirmation came the day after the attorney for UM head coach [[Jim Larrañaga]] said that the coach was unaware of any impropriety in the program.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sun-sentinel.com/sports/miami-hurricanes/fl-sp-miami-hurricanes-fbi-basketball-20170927-story.html |title=UM acknowledges probe; Larrañaga denies knowing identity of 'Coach-3' |first=Christy |last=Cabrera Chirinos |newspaper=[[Sun-Sentinel]] |location=[[Deerfield Beach, Florida|Deerfield Beach, FL]] |date=September 27, 2017 |access-date=October 3, 2017}}</ref> The documents allege that a UM coach identified only as "Coach-3" requested that Gatto arrange a $150,000 payment from Adidas to the family of a top high school player identified as "Player-12" in an attempt to keep him from signing with a "University-4" that was sponsored by a rival apparel company.<ref name="Gatto complaint U7">{{cite web|url=https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/press-release/file/999006/download |title=Complaint, ''United States v.

==== Oklahoma State and South Carolina ====
Lamont Evans, at the time an assistant at Oklahoma State, was one of the four coaches arrested on September 26. He was accused of taking at least $22,000 in bribes from two financial advisors, one of whom was acting as an FBI informant. The alleged bribes were offered over a five-year period that included Evans' former tenure as an assistant at South Carolina. Oklahoma State fired Evans on September 28.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/oklahoma-state-fires-associate-head-coach-lamont-evans-amid-fbi-investigation/ |title=Oklahoma State fires associate head coach Lamont Evans amid FBI investigation |first=Kyle |last=Boone |work=CBS Sports |date=September 28, 2017 |access-date=October 2, 2017}}</ref>

Oklahoma State lost one potential recruit due to the scandal. On the same day Evans was fired, Antwann Jones, a guard ranked by ESPN as one of the top 50 players in the recruiting class of 2018, rescinded a verbal commitment he had made to the program less than two weeks earlier.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.espn.com/college-football/recruiting/story/_/id/20853831/antwann-jones-no-45-prospect-espn-100-decommits-oklahoma-state |title=Antwann Jones, No. 45 in ESPN 100, decommits from Oklahoma St. |first=Jeff |last=Borzello |work=ESPN |date=September 28, 2017 |access-date=October 3, 2017}}</ref>

In the aftermath of the announcement of the FBI investigation, [[Alabama Crimson Tide men's basketball|Alabama]] director of basketball operations Kobie Baker resigned following an internal investigation into the program.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://sports.yahoo.com/alabama-basketball-administrator-resigns-amid-020013932.html |title=Alabama Basketball Administrator Kobie Baker Resigns Amid FBI Investigation |first=Khadrice |last=Rollins |work=Yahoo!

Baker allegedly accepted a $5,000 payment for arranging a meeting between Michel and the father of the player, and an additional $10,000 for helping to steer the player toward Michel.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.tidesports.com/kobie-baker-resignation-fbi-investigation/ |title=Kobie Baker resignation tied to FBI investigation |date=September 27, 2017 |work=TideSports.com |access-date=November 7, 2017 |language=en-US |archive-date=November 7, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107222107/https://www.tidesports.com/kobie-baker-resignation-fbi-investigation/ |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Before Alabama's exhibition game on November 6, 2017, the school announced that freshman point guard [[Collin Sexton]] would not play that game<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaab/sec/2017/11/06/alabama-freshman-point-guard-collin-sexton-not-eligible-ncaa-exhibition/838454001/ |title=Alabama freshman point guard Collin Sexton not eligible, missed exhibition game |first=Kevin |last=Spain |work=USA Today |date=November 6, 2017 |access-date=November 7, 2017 |language=en}}</ref> nor the first regular season game against [[2017–18 Memphis Tigers men's basketball team|Memphis]] due to eligibility concerns. Sexton would later be cleared to play for Alabama starting with their November 14 game against [[2017–18 Lipscomb Bisons men's basketball team|Lipscomb]].

==== USC ====
On September 26, federal prosecutors in [[New York City|New York]] announced charges of fraud and corruption against USC assistant coach Tony Bland.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/20824193/ncaa-basketball-coaches-10-charged-fraud-corruption |title=NCAA basketball coaches among 10 charged with fraud, corruption |work=ESPN |access-date=September 26, 2017}}</ref> The charges allege that Bland and others allegedly received benefits from financial advisers and others to influence student-athletes to retain their services.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaab/2017/09/26/college-basketball-assistants-arrested-fbi-fraud-corruption-scheme/703295001/ |title=FBI arrests four college basketball assistants on charges of fraud |work=USA Today |access-date=September 26, 2017 |language=en}}</ref> Following the announcement, USC placed Bland on administrative leave and announced that it would conduct an internal investigation of the matter.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://collegebasketball.nbcsports.com/2017/09/26/usc-hires-former-fbi-director-freeh-tony-bland-placed-on-leave/ |title=USC hires former FBI director Freeh, Tony Bland placed on leave |date=September 26, 2017 |work=NBC Sports |access-date=September 26, 2017 |language=en-US}}</ref> After playing in only a few games in the 2017–18 season, on January 15, 2018, sophomore point guard [[De'Anthony Melton]] was indefinitely suspended as a result of the investigation. Melton would later remove himself from the university on February 21, 2018, in order to enter the [[2018 NBA draft]] and begin training for it early, where he was selected 46th by the [[Houston Rockets]] and was later traded to the [[Phoenix Suns]] on August 31 before the upcoming NBA season began.

On Friday, December 13, 2019, USC received a notice of allegations from the NCAA in regards to the violations stemming from this investigation into the USC basketball department.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/28292856/usc-gets-notice-allegations-ncaa-tied-federal-probe |title=USC gets notice of allegations from NCAA tied to federal probe |work=ESPN |access-date=December 13, 2019 |language=en}}</ref>

=== Second wave ===
==== Arizona ====
On February 23, 2018, FBI wiretaps reportedly showed that head coach [[Sean Miller]] had discussed with Dawkins about paying [[Deandre Ayton]] $100,000 to facilitate Ayton's commitment to the [[University of Arizona]], with the monetary situation being dealt with directly to him. 247Sports, which follows high school players and their recruitment, had predicted 99% that Ayton would be attending [[University of Kansas]] the night of his commitment.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/22559284/sean-miller-arizona-christian-dawkins-discussed-payment-ensure-deandre-ayton-signing-according-fbi-investigation |title=FBI wiretaps show Sean Miller discussed $100K payment to lock recruit |last=Schlabach |first=Mark |date=February 23, 2018 |website=ESPN |access-date=February 24, 2018}}</ref> If he were implicated in this case, it would have potentially hurt Ayton's chances of finishing out the rest of his season with Arizona, as well as result in him entering the [[2018 NBA draft]] earlier than anticipated, similar to that of [[De'Anthony Melton]]<!--his future teammate with the Phoenix Suns in their rookie seasons together-->.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.azdesertswarm.com/basketball/2018/2/23/17047208/arizona-basketball-sean-miller-discussed-paying-100000-ensure-signing-deandre-ayton-espn-fbi-fire |title=Sean Miller discussed paying $100,000 to ensure signing of Deandre Ayton, per ESPN |last=Kelapire |first=Ryan |date=February 23, 2018 |website=Arizona Desert Storm |publisher=[[SB Nation]] |access-date=February 24, 2018}}</ref> The following day, Miller notified the team that he would not coach in that night's game against [[2017–18 Oregon Ducks men's basketball team|Oregon]], with associate coach [[Lorenzo Romar]] coaching the team instead and Ayton being allowed to play for Arizona that game.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/22567552/sean-miller-coach-arizona-wildcats-saturday-oregon-ducks |title=Arizona's Sean Miller doesn't coach vs. Oregon; Deandre Ayton starts |date=February 24, 2018 |website=ESPN |access-date=February 24, 2018}}</ref> However, Ayton and his family have maintained they did not earn any monetary benefits to attend Arizona, with further information suggesting that Miller's calls to Dawkins were related to the recruitment of another player instead.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://247sports.com/Article/Sources-Conflicting-information-in-ESPNs-report-involving-Arizona-star-DeAndre-Ayton-coach-Sean-Miller-115594868 |title=Sources: Conflicting information in ESPN's report involving Arizona star DeAndre Ayton, coach Sean Miller |work=247sports.com |access-date=March 7, 2018}}</ref> This ultimately led to Ayton being cleared to finish out the season with Arizona. On March 1, Miller made his first public comments since the reporting on the wiretaps, in which he unequivocally denied any involvement in payments to players. ESPN reported that Miller would coach the team that night against [[2017–18 Stanford Cardinal men's basketball team|Stanford]], with Miller confirmed to remain the coach for Arizona throughout the rest of this season, as well as a bit further beyond that.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/22616244/sean-miller-arizona-wildcats-coach-denies-report-discussed-paying-recruit |title=Arizona's Sean Miller denies report he discussed paying recruit, gets support from board |website=ESPN |date=March 1, 2018 |access-date=March 1, 2018}}</ref> (In part because of the continued corruption investigation, Miller would eventually be fired by Arizona in April 2021.)<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/31209814/sources-arizona-wildcats-fire-coach-sean-miller |title=Arizona Wildcats fire men's basketball coach Sean Miller |website=ESPN |date=April 7, 2021 |access-date=April 7, 2021}}</ref>

Arizona, which had already lost one of its three-member 2018 recruiting class after the initial allegations, initially lost its remaining two 2018 recruits after the new revelations. Power forward [[Shareef O'Neal]], son of [[List of players in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] player [[Shaquille O'Neal]] and rated as a top-30 prospect, announced on February 24 that he was rescinding a commitment he had made in April 2017 to play at Arizona. Because the younger O'Neal signed a nonbinding financial aid agreement instead of a formal letter of intent, he did not need a release from Arizona to choose a new destination,<ref name="O'Neal decommit">{{cite news|url=http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/22567755/shareef-oneal-decommits-arizona-wildcats-amid-fbi-probe |title=Arizona commit Shareef O'Neal, Shaquille's son, opens recruitment amid investigation |first=Jeff |last=Borzello |website=ESPN |date=February 24, 2018 |access-date=February 24, 2018}}</ref> and he would commit to [[UCLA Bruins men's basketball|UCLA]] three days later.<ref name="Williams decommit"/> Arizona's only remaining recruit at the time in the 2018 class, point guard Brandon Williams, also did not sign a letter of intent, giving him the option to reopen his recruitment, and he chose to do so on March 2.<ref name="Williams decommit"/> However, unlike Shareef O'Neal, Williams decided to recommit to Arizona on May 5, 2018.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://arizonasports.com/story/1139527/four-star-recruit-brandon-williams-recommits-to-arizona/ |title=Four-star PG recruit Brandon Williams recommits to Arizona |date=May 5, 2018 |work=Arizona Sports |access-date=June 1, 2018}}</ref>

==== NC State ====
According to the documents viewed by [[Yahoo! Sports]], former [[NC State Wolfpack men's basketball|NC State]] and current NBA player [[Dennis Smith Jr.]] had received $43,500 from ASM Sports, an agency run by reported cooperating government witness Andy Miller, before enrolling at the school. Another document said that Smith had received over $70,000 in loans, with the document also including notes about "how to recoup the money" after Smith chose not to sign with ASM Sports.<ref name="Yahoo 2-23"/>

The April 2018 indictments specifically charge that Gatto was involved in a scheme to funnel $40,000 to Smith's family in October 2015 in exchange for signing with NC State. Adidas had a well-established relationship with both Smith and NC State, as Smith was playing for an Adidas-sponsored [[Amateur Athletic Union|AAU]] team at the time, and NC State was then (as now) an Adidas-backed program. The indictment also claimed that an NC State coach identified only as "Coach-4" was the conduit for this payment. Smith would sign a financial aid agreement with the school in December of that year.<ref name="Yahoo 4-10"/>

==== Seton Hall ====
The ASM documents also claim that current NBA player [[Isaiah Whitehead]] received at least $26,000 from ASM while at [[Seton Hall Pirates men's basketball|Seton Hall]]. He signed with ASM after leaving for the [[2016 NBA draft]], but later moved to [[Roc Nation]].<ref name="Yahoo 2-23"/>

==== LSU ====
Former [[LSU Tigers basketball|LSU]] player [[Tim Quarterman]] allegedly received at least $16,000 from ASM while at the school.<ref name="Yahoo 2-23"/>

==== Maryland ====
[[Diamond Stone]], who played at [[Maryland Terrapins men's basketball|Maryland]] in the 2015–16 season, allegedly received over $14,000 from ASM.<ref name="Yahoo 2-23"/> The school launched an internal investigation into possible ties with the scandal, with head coach [[Mark Turgeon]] denying that he or any of his staff members had any involvement with the agency.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/22567629/maryland-basketball-conducting-internal-review-fbi-probe |title=Maryland will conduct internal review amid FBI investigation |first=Jamison |last=Hensley |website=ESPN |date=February 24, 2018 |access-date=February 24, 2018}}</ref>

The April 2018 indictments peripherally linked Maryland and its current apparel provider, [[Under Armour]], to the scandal in a completely separate context, although neither was explicitly named in those documents. The FBI alleged that Gatto and a co-conspirator identified in the documents as "CC-3" agreed to make payments to the guardian of a 2017 recruit who was identified by media as [[Silvio De Sousa]]. According to the documents, the guardian told "CC-3" that he had received illicit payments from individuals connected with Under Armour in exchange for De Sousa's commitment to Maryland. The guardian also indicated that De Sousa preferred to go to Kansas, but that he would need to repay the illicit payments to facilitate the player's wishes. Gatto and "CC-3" then allegedly paid the guardian $20,000. De Sousa, who had been considered by most recruiting experts as a virtual lock to attend Maryland, committed to Kansas on August 30, 2017. It should also be noted that shortly after the 2018 indictments were unsealed, De Sousa's guardian denied accepting any illicit payments.<ref name="Schlabach 4-10"/><ref name="Yahoo 4-10"/><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/how-maryland-under-armour-were-roped-into-fbi-investigation-of-kansas-recruit/ |title=How Maryland, Under Armour were roped into FBI investigation of Kansas recruit |first=Matt |last=Norlander |website=CBS Sports |date=April 11, 2018 |access-date=April 24, 2018}}</ref>

==== Kentucky ====
A spreadsheet in the documents viewed by Yahoo! Sports listed a $12,000 payment to a prospect identified as "BAM". A later note in the document identifies this individual as [[Bam Adebayo]], who played only one season at [[Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball|Kentucky]] in 2016–17. Other documents claim that Adebayo received $36,500 in loans. Additionally, then-current Wildcats player [[Kevin Knox II]] was listed among several players who had met or dined with Dawkins, or whose families had done so.<ref name="Yahoo 2-23"/>

==== Washington ====
[[Markelle Fultz]], who played a season at [[Washington Huskies men's basketball|Washington]] before leaving to become the top pick in the [[2017 NBA draft]], allegedly received $10,000 from ASM.<ref name="Yahoo 2-23"/>

==== USC ====
Melton would ultimately not be the only USC player implicated. The ASM documents claim that two other current USC players, or individuals closely associated with them, had received payments from the company.<ref name="Yahoo 2-23"/>

==== Utah ====
[[Kyle Kuzma]], a 2017 first-round NBA draft pick, was listed in the ASM documents as having received $9,500 from the agency while at [[Utah Utes men's basketball|Utah]].<ref name="Yahoo 2-23"/>

==== Xavier ====
Former [[Xavier Musketeers men's basketball|Xavier]] star [[Edmond Sumner]] and his father reportedly received at least $7,000 in advances from ASM during the younger Sumner's college career.<ref name="Yahoo 2-23"/>

==== South Carolina ====
After being withheld from play by Louisville amid questions regarding his eligibility stemming from the original revelations, [[Brian Bowen]] withdrew from the school and eventually enrolled at South Carolina, though he would not be eligible to play for the Gamecocks' basketball program until January 2019. However, the ASM documents raise more questions about his NCAA eligibility, allegedly listing at least $7,000 in benefits to him and his family during his high school career. That would result in him later rescinding his collegiate entry altogether, instead opting to begin a professional basketball career early, starting with the [[Sydney Kings]] in [[Australia]]. In addition, [[PJ Dozier]], a star on South Carolina's [[2016–17 South Carolina Gamecocks men's basketball team|2017 Final Four team]], was alleged to have received over $6,000 while at the school.<ref name="Yahoo 2-23"/>

==== Kansas ====
The mother of former [[Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball|Kansas]] (KU) star [[Josh Jackson (basketball)|Josh Jackson]], Apples Jones, reportedly received $2,700 from ASM during Jackson's college career.<ref name="Yahoo 2-23"/>

The April 2018 indictments raised more serious issues surrounding the Kansas program, which is also sponsored by Adidas. Gatto and the coach of an Adidas-sponsored AAU team were alleged to have given at least $90,000 to the mother of a KU recruit between October 2016 and November 2017 in exchange for the player's commitment to the school.<ref name="Schlabach 4-10"/><ref name="Yahoo 4-10"/> Sources close to the investigation told Yahoo! Sports that this player was [[Billy Preston (basketball)|Billy Preston]], who committed to KU in November 2016 and enrolled at the school in 2017. He played in two exhibition games, but the school did not allow him to play during the beginning [[2017–18 Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball team|2017–18 season]] and then left school after questions were raised about his ownership of a car he was driving at the time of an auto accident. Another member of KU's 2017 recruiting class, [[Silvio De Sousa]], was linked to illicit payments in the 2018 indictments.<ref name="Yahoo 4-12">{{cite news|url=https://www.yahoo.com/sports/new-charges-college-hoops-corruption-case-mean-182225446.html |title=What do new charges in college hoops corruption case mean? |first1=Pat |last1=Forde |first2=Pete |last2=Thamel |first3=Dan |last3=Wetzel |work=Yahoo!

==== Texas ====
Then-current [[Texas Longhorns men's basketball|Texas]] player Eric Davis Jr. allegedly received $1,500 from ASM.<ref name="Yahoo 2-23"/> Texas held him out of the team's February 24 game against [[2017–18 Oklahoma State Cowboys basketball team|Oklahoma State]].<ref name="Davis, Pope">{{cite news|url=http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/22557156/texas-longhorns-san-diego-state-aztecs-keep-players-games-amid-inquiry-allegations |title=Texas' Eric Davis Jr., San Diego State's Malik Pope shelved during inquiry into allegations |first=Jeff |last=Borzello |website=ESPN |date=February 24, 2018 |access-date=February 24, 2018}}</ref>  In addition, former Longhorns player Prince Ibeh was found in Dawkins' list of players and/or families who had met with or dined with Dawkins while in high school or college.<ref name="Yahoo 2-23"/>

==== San Diego State ====
Then-current [[San Diego State Aztecs men's basketball|San Diego State]] player [[Malik Pope]] allegedly received $1,400 from ASM. Pope was withheld from the team's February 24 game against [[2017–18 San Jose State Spartans men's basketball team|San Jose State]]<ref name="Davis, Pope"/> while the school launched an internal investigation into the allegations. San Diego State cleared Pope to play prior to the Aztecs' February 27 game against [[2017–18 Boise State Broncos men's basketball team|Boise State]], determining that there was no credible evidence that Pope had received any impermissible benefits.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/22598634/malik-pope-san-diego-state-cleared-play-name-appeared-fbi-corruption-investigation |title=San Diego State: No evidence Malik Pope got impermissible benefits |agency=Associated Press |website=ESPN |date=February 28, 2018 |access-date=February 28, 2018}}</ref>

Former [[Clemson Tigers men's basketball|Clemson]] star [[Jaron Blossomgame]] reportedly received a payment of $1,100 while at the school.<ref name="Yahoo 2-23"/>

==== Wichita State ====
The ASM documents allege that former [[Wichita State Shockers men's basketball|Wichita State]] star [[Fred VanVleet]] received at least $1,000 while playing for the school.<ref name="Yahoo 2-23"/>

==== Michigan State ====
The mother of then-current [[Michigan State Spartans men's basketball|Michigan State]] star [[Miles Bridges]] reportedly received several hundred dollars in advances from ASM.<ref name="Yahoo 2-23"/> An internal Michigan State investigation found that allegations that Bridges' mother had received about $400 in cash from Dawkins were false, but confirmed that Dawkins had paid slightly over $70 for a dinner with Bridges family members (though without the player present). Bridges was temporarily ruled ineligible because of the dinner, but his eligibility was restored on February 24, just in time to play for the Spartans' regular season finale at Wisconsin. Bridges made a $40 contribution (the approximate value of his family members' meals at the Dawkins meeting) to a charity of his choice as part of the reinstatement process.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/22589989/michigan-state-miles-bridges-donates-40-charity-resolve-ncaa-violation |title=Miles Bridges donates $40 to charity to resolve NCAA violation |website=ESPN |date=February 26, 2018 |access-date=February 26, 2018}}</ref>

==== Other players potentially implicated ====
The ASM documents also indicated that several players, or their family members, had either met or dined with Dawkins while the players were in high school or college. According to a lawyer involved with NCAA compliance issues who was interviewed in the Yahoo! Sports report, merely meeting with an agent is not an NCAA violation, but if the agent pays for a player's or family member's meal, the meal can be considered an "extra benefit" under NCAA rules. In addition to the aforementioned Knox and Ibeh, the following then-current and former NCAA players were listed in the ASM documents in this context:<ref name="Yahoo 2-23"/>
