{{Short description|Literature analysis technique}}
{{more citations needed|date=November 2017}}
A '''critical lens''' is a way of looking at a particular work of [[literature]] by focusing on style choices, plot devices, and character interactions and how they show a certain theme (the lens in question). It is a common [[literary analysis]] technique.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/subject_specific_writing/writing_in_literature/literary_theory_and_schools_of_criticism/index.html|title=Introduction to Literary Theory // Purdue Writing Lab|last=Lab|first=Purdue Writing|website=Purdue Writing Lab|language=en|access-date=2019-03-05}}</ref>

== Types ==
There are many types of critical lenses but there are several that are the most common.

===Marxist===
{{Main|Marxist literary criticism}}
The Marxist critical lens came into vogue with the advent of the [[Marxist]] school of thought. Sometimes also called the [[socioeconomic]] lens, this focuses on how characters' wealth and social connections affects the work.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/subject_specific_writing/writing_in_literature/literary_theory_and_schools_of_criticism/marxist_criticism.html|title=Marxist Criticism // Purdue Writing Lab|last=Lab|first=Purdue Writing|website=Purdue Writing Lab|language=en|access-date=2019-03-05}}</ref> [[Leon Trotsky]]'s [[Literature and Revolution]] claims that "old literature and 'culture' were the expressions of the nobleman and the bureaucrat" and that "the proletariat has also to create its own culture and its own art".<ref>{{Cite book|title=Literature and revolution|author=Trotsky, Leon|date=2005|publisher=Haymarket Books|isbn=1931859167|location=Chicago|oclc=56517462}}</ref> This viewpoint is common for the Marxist critical lens.

===Psychoanalytic===

Also called the [[Freudian]] or [[Jungian]] critical lens, this school of thought analyzes the [[Psychology|psychological]] motives of the characters. Jungian literary criticism in particular focuses on [[Jungian archetypes|archetypes]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/subject_specific_writing/writing_in_literature/literary_theory_and_schools_of_criticism/psychoanalytic_criticism.html|title=Psychoanalytic Criticism // Purdue Writing Lab|last=Lab|first=Purdue Writing|website=Purdue Writing Lab|language=en|access-date=2019-03-05}}</ref>

===Feminist===

===Gender/Queer Studies===
{{Main|Queer literary interpretation}}
The gender/queer lens, while influenced by the feminist lens, treats [[gender]] as more of a spectrum, and also considers [[human sexuality]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/subject_specific_writing/writing_in_literature/literary_theory_and_schools_of_criticism/gender_studies_and_queer_theory.html|title=Gender Studies and Queer Theory // Purdue Writing Lab|last=Lab|first=Purdue Writing|website=Purdue Writing Lab|language=en|access-date=2019-03-05}}</ref> David Richter notes in ''The Critical Tradition: Classic Texts and Contemporary Trends'' that "[[XXY male|XXY]] syndromes, natural [[Sexual dimorphism|sexual bimorphisms]], as well as surgical [[transsexual]]s [...] defy attempts at binary classification". This thinking, along with the advent of a more prominent [[LGBT]] community, has heavily influenced this lens.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Critical tradition : classic texts and contemporary trends|date=1998|publisher=Bedford Books|author=Richter, David H.|isbn=0312101066|edition=2nd|location=Boston|oclc=38274747|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/criticaltraditio00rich}}</ref>

===Semiotics===
{{Main|Semiotic literary criticism}}The semiotic literary lens grew out of the structuralist literary lens, which was influenced by [[structuralism]]. It came about with the advent of [[semiotics]].

===Moral===
The moral lens was the earliest critical lens to come about, beginning in Book X of [[Plato]]'s [[Republic (Plato)|''Republic'']]. In it, he notes "will any one be profited if under the influence of [...] poetry, man neglect[s] justice and virtue?"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/republic.11.x.html|title=The Internet Classics Archive {{!}} The Republic by Plato|website=classics.mit.edu|access-date=2019-03-05}}</ref> This lens was common through the end of the 19th century. For example, in [[Jonathan Swift]]'s [[Gulliver's Travels]], Gulliver notes in one of his letters that he had written "for [people's] amendment, and not their approbation",<ref>{{Citation|author=Swift, Jonathan|title=Gulliver's travels|isbn=9781982711368|oclc=1054909999}}</ref> reflecting the belief at the time that the novel was primarily a method for instruction of the populace, and entertainment was only a secondary goal. This is especially true in books for children from the time - see for example the book that a young [[Jane Eyre]] is given by [[Mr. Brocklehurst]], which "'is a book entitled the 'Child's Guide,' read it with prayer, especially that part containing 'An account of the awfully sudden death of Martha G -, a naughty child addicted to falsehood and deceit'" - this is meant to instruct Jane in the consequences of lying, and was common in children's literature of the time.<ref>{{Citation|author=BrontÃ«, Charlotte|title=Jane Eyre|isbn=9781489471703|oclc=1076519534}}</ref> This lens is common in analysis of [[Religion|religious]] works.
