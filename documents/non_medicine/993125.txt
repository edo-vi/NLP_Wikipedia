==Career==
===Early life===
Born in [[Albany, Georgia]], Angelo Taylor studied at the [[Georgia Institute of Technology]] and won the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] title in 1998 and placed second in 1997. In 1998, Taylor also won a silver medal at the US National Championships. He went on to win the title three times from 1999 to 2001.

Taylor made his debut in a major international meet at the [[1999 World Championships in Athletics|1999 World Championships]], where he finished third in his heat in 400 m hurdles, but ran a third leg at the gold medal-winning US 4x400 m [[Relay race|relay]] team.

===2000 Olympic champion===
In 2000, Taylor ran a world-leading time at the Olympic Trials and entered the Sydney Games as a favorite. In a thrilling final, Taylor moved from fourth place to first over the final two hurdles and barely edged [[Saudi Arabia]]'s [[Hadi Souan Somayli]] by 0.03 seconds in the closest finish in the history of the event. Taylor ran in the heat and semifinal of 4x400 m relay race, the finals team for which won the gold medal. On August 2, 2008, the International Olympic Committee stripped the gold medal from the U.S. men's 4x400-meter relay team, after [[Antonio Pettigrew]] admitted using a banned substance.<ref name="pettigrew">{{cite news|last=Wilson|first=Stephen|title= IOC strips gold from 2000 US relay team|agency=Associated Press|date=2 August 2008}}</ref> Three of the four runners in the event final, including Pettigrew and twins [[Alvin Harrison|Alvin]] and [[Calvin Harrison (athlete)|Calvin Harrison]], and preliminary round runner [[Jerome Young]], all have admitted or tested positive for performance-enhancing drugs.<ref name="pettigrew"/> Only Taylor and world record holder [[Michael Johnson (athlete)|Michael Johnson]] were not implicated.<ref name="pettigrew"/>

Taylor was eliminated in the semifinals of the [[2001 World Championships in Athletics|2001 World Championships]] in 400 m hurdles while struggling with a sinus infection and flu, but won a gold as a member of US 4x400 m relay team. He didn't make the US World Championships team in 2003 and was unsuccessful in defending his Olympic title at the [[2004 Summer Olympics]], finishing fourth in the semifinal.

===Second Olympic title===
In 2007 Taylor set a new personal best in the 400 m and won the American title in the event. He won the 400&nbsp;m bronze medal at the [[2007 World Championships in Athletics|2007 World Championships]] in [[Osaka]] and won another gold medal as part of the USA 4×400m relay team.

At the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] in Beijing, China, Taylor became a double Olympic champion, winning gold in the 400 metre hurdles and the 4×400 m relay. At the [[2009 World Championships in Athletics]] he failed to make it out of the heats of the hurdles, but was part of the American 4×400&nbsp;m relay team which successfully defended its world title.

Taylor finished second in the 200m at the 2010 [[Rieti IAAF Grand Prix]] in August with a new personal record time of 20.23&nbsp;seconds.<ref>Sampaolo, Diego (2010-08-29).
