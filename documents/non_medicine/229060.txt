'''Old age''' is the range of ages for persons nearing and surpassing [[life expectancy]]. People of old age are also referred to as: '''old people''', '''elderly''', '''elders''',  '''seniors''', '''senior citizens''', or '''older adults'''.<ref>''Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association, 6th edition'' (American Psychological Association, 2009) {{ISBN|1433805618}}{{page needed|date=February 2015}}</ref>

Definitions of old age include official definitions, sub-group definitions, and four dimensions as follows.

===Official definitions===
Most developed Western countries set the retirement age around the age of 65; this is also generally considered to mark the transition from middle to old age. Reaching  this age is commonly a requirement to become eligible for senior social programs.<ref>{{cite web|last=Barry|first=Patricia|title=Medicare Eligibility Requirements – How to Qualify for Medicare – AARP Everyw...|url=http://www.aarp.org/health/medicare-insurance/info-04-2011/medicare-eligibility.html|access-date=2016-04-13|website=AARP|archive-date=2016-04-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160413021321/http://www.aarp.org/health/medicare-insurance/info-04-2011/medicare-eligibility.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

Old age cannot be universally defined because it is context-sensitive. The United Nations, for example, considers old age to be 60 years or older.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Scherbov|first1=Sergei|last2=Sanderson|first2=Warren|date=2019|title=New Measures of Population Ageing|url=https://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/events/pdf/expert/29/session1/EGM_25Feb2019_S1_SergeiScherbov.pdf|access-date=21 December 2021|website=United Nations|archive-date=21 December 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211221231510/https://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/events/pdf/expert/29/session1/EGM_25Feb2019_S1_SergeiScherbov.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref> In contrast, a 2001 joint report by the U.S. National Institute on Aging and the [[World Health Organization]] [WHO] Regional Office for Africa set the beginning of old age in Sub-Saharan Africa at 50.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Kowal |first1=Paul |last2=Peachey |first2=Karen |title=Indicators for the Minimum Data Set Project on Ageing: A Critical Review in sub-Saharan Africa |url=https://www.who.int/healthinfo/survey/ageing_mds_report_en_daressalaam.pdf |website=World Health Organization |access-date=1 December 2021 |page=9 |date=June 2001 |type=report |archive-date=8 December 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211208130034/https://www.who.int/healthinfo/survey/ageing_mds_report_en_daressalaam.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref> This lower threshold stems primarily from a different way of thinking about old age in developing nations. Unlike in the developed world, where chronological age determines retirement, societies in developing countries determine old age according to a person's ability to make active contributions to society.<ref>Gorman M. Development and the rights of older people. In: Randel J, et al., eds. The ageing and development report: poverty, independence and the world's older people. London, Earthscan Publications Ltd.,1999:3-21</ref> This number is also significantly affected by lower life expectancy throughout the developing world. Dating back to the middle ages and prior, what certain scholars thought of as old age varied depending on the context, but the state of being elderly was often thought as being 60 years of age or older in many respects. <ref>https://academic.oup.com/shm/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/shm/6.3.313</ref>

===Sub-group definitions{{anchor|Third age}}===
[[Gerontology|Gerontologists]] have recognized that people experience very different conditions as they approach old age.

Two British scholars, Paul Higgs and Chris Gilleard, have added a "fourth age" sub-group. In British English, the "third age" is "the period in life of active retirement, following middle age".<ref>''Oxford English Dictionary'', s.v. "third age".</ref> Higgs and Gilleard describe the fourth age as "an arena of inactive, unhealthy, unproductive, and ultimately unsuccessful ageing".<ref>Paul Higgs and Chris Gilleard, ''Rethinking Old Age: Theorizing the Fourth Age'' (Palgrave Macmillan, 2015), vii, 119–120.</ref>

===Senior citizen===
Senior citizen is a common euphemism for an old person used in [[American English]], and sometimes in [[British English]]. It implies that the person being referred to is retired.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oup.com/oald-bin/web_getald7index1a.pl |title=Oxford Learner's Dictionaries &#124; Find the meanings, definitions, pictures, pronunciation of words at OxfordLearnersDictionaries.com |website=Oup.com |access-date=2016-04-04 |archive-date=2010-01-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100130211752/http://www.oup.com/oald-bin/web_getald7index1a.pl |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/61/36/S0263600.html|title=Bartleby.com: Great Books Online – Quotes, Poems, Novels, Classics and hundreds more|access-date=12 June 2016|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080420174106/http://www.bartleby.com/61/36/S0263600.html|archive-date=20 April 2008}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.chambersharrap.co.uk/chambers/features/chref/chref.py/main?query=senior+citizen&title=21st|title=Chambersharrap.co.uk|website=Chambersharrap.co.uk|access-date=8 March 2022|archive-date=13 May 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210513021212/http://www.chambersharrap.co.uk/chambers/features/chref/chref.py/main?query=senior+citizen&title=21st|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/define.asp?key=71747&dict=CALD |title=senior citizen Meaning in the Cambridge English Dictionary |website=Dictionary.cambridge.org |date=2016-03-30 |access-date=2016-04-04 |archive-date=2009-12-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091225100322/http://dictionary.cambridge.org/define.asp?key=71747&dict=CALD |url-status=dead }}</ref> This in turn usually implies that the person is over the [[retirement age]], which varies according to country. Synonyms include '''old age pensioner''' or '''pensioner''' in British English, and '''retiree''' and '''senior''' in American English. Some dictionaries describe widespread use of "senior citizen" for people over the age of 65.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ldoceonline.com/dictionary/senior-citizen |title=senior citizen – Definition from Longman English Dictionary Online |website=Ldoceonline.com |access-date=2016-04-04 |archive-date=2016-04-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160406171039/http://www.ldoceonline.com/dictionary/senior-citizen |url-status=live }}</ref>

When defined in a legal context, ''senior citizen'' is often used for legal or policy-related reasons in determining who is eligible for certain benefits available to the age group.

It is used in general usage instead of traditional terms such as "old person", "old-age pensioner", or "elderly" as a courtesy and to signify continuing relevance of and respect for this population group as "[[citizen]]s" of society, of senior "rank".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Waughfield|first1=Claire G.|last2=Burckhalter|first2=Teresa S.|title=Mental health concepts|date=2002|publisher=Delmar/Thomson Learning|location=Clifton Park, NY|isbn=9780766838307|page=[https://archive.org/details/mentalhealthconc0000waug/page/64 64]|edition=5th|url=https://archive.org/details/mentalhealthconc0000waug|url-access=registration|access-date=4 April 2016|language=en}}</ref>

The term was apparently coined in 1938 during a political campaign.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theseniortimes.com/richler.htm|title=The Senior Times Online|access-date=12 June 2016|archive-date=6 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306161123/http://www.theseniortimes.com/richler.htm|url-status=live}}</ref> Famed caricaturist [[Al Hirschfeld]] claimed on several occasions that his father Isaac Hirschfeld invented the term "senior citizen".<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zIgT8dfbX1wC&q=al+hirschfeld+father+coined+senior+citizen&pg=PA10 | title=Hirschfeld: On Line | publisher=Applause Theatre & Cinema Books | page=10 | date=February 1, 2000| access-date=December 19, 2015| isbn=9781557833563 }}</ref><ref>{{cite AV media| people = Al Hirschfeld| title = The Line King: The Al Hirschfeld Story | medium = VHS| publisher = Cabin Fever Entertainment| date = 1996 }}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://content.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,417721,00.html | title=That Old Feeling: The Fun in Al Hirschfeld | magazine=Time | author=Richard Corliss | date=January 29, 2003| access-date=December 19, 2015}}</ref> It has come into widespread use in recent decades in legislation, commerce, and common speech. Especially in less formal contexts, it is often abbreviated as "senior(s)", which is also used as an [[adjective]].

====Age qualifications====
The age of 65 has long been considered the benchmark for senior citizenship in numerous countries. This convention originated from Chancellor Otto von Bismarck's introduction of the pension system in Germany during the late 19th century. Bismarck's legislation set the retirement age at 70, with 65 as the age at which individuals could start receiving a pension. This age standard gradually gained acceptance in other nations and has since become deeply entrenched in public consciousness.<ref>{{Cite web |title=What Age is Considered Senior Citizen - MGFS |url=https://www.myguideforseniors.com/what-age-is-considered-senior-citizen/ |access-date=2023-06-21 |website=My Guide For Seniors |language=en-US}}</ref>

The age which qualifies for senior citizen status varies widely. In governmental contexts, it is usually associated with an age at which [[pension]]s or medical benefits for the elderly become available. In commercial contexts, where it may serve as a [[marketing]] device to attract customers, the age is often significantly lower.<ref>{{cite web |author=Ahn Shin-Hyun |url=http://www.seriworld.org/01/wldContVod.html?mn=A&mncd=0301&sort=A&gubun=00&p_page=65&natcd=KR&key=20110404000005 |title=Economic Report |publisher=SERIWorld |date=2011-04-04 |access-date=2016-04-04 |archive-date=2016-04-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160416094031/http://www.seriworld.org/01/wldContVod.html?mn=A&mncd=0301&sort=A&gubun=00&p_page=65&natcd=KR&key=20110404000005 |url-status=live }}</ref>

In commerce, some businesses offer customers of a certain age a "[[senior discount]]". The age at which these discounts are available varies from 55, 60, 62 or 65 upwards, and other criteria may also apply. Sometimes a special "[[senior discount card]]" or other proof of age needs to be produced to show entitlement.

In the [[United States]], the standard retirement age is currently 66 (gradually increasing to 67).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ssa.gov/planners/retire/ageincrease.html |title=Retirement Age Calculator |website=Ssa.gov |date=2014-09-03 |access-date=2016-04-04 |archive-date=2016-04-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160417181217/https://www.ssa.gov/planners/retire/ageincrease.html |url-status=live }}</ref> The [[AARP]] allows couples in which one spouse has reached the age of 50 to join, regardless of the age of the other spouse.

In [[Canada]], the [[Old Age Security]] (OAS) pension is available at 65 (the Conservative government of Stephen Harper had planned to gradually increase the age of eligibility to 67, starting in the years 2023–2029, although the Liberal government of Justin Trudeau is considering leaving it at 65),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.servicecanada.gc.ca/eng/isp/oas/changes/index.shtml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401232413/http://www.servicecanada.gc.ca/eng/isp/oas/changes/index.shtml |access-date=November 25, 2014 |archive-date=2012-04-01 |title=Changes to Old Age Security }}</ref> and the [[Canada Pension Plan]] (CPP) as early as age 60.

The distinguishing characteristics of old age are both physical and mental.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=1891555|year=1991|last1=Salokangas|first1=R.

A basic mark of old age that affects both body and mind is "slowness of behavior".<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1146/annurev.ps.46.020195.001553|pmid=7872732|title=Aging and Speed of Behavior: Possible Consequences for Psychological Functioning|journal=Annual Review of Psychology|volume=46|pages=329–353|year=1995|last1=Birren|first1=J E|last2=Fisher|first2=L M}}</ref> The term describes a correlation between advancing age and slowness of reaction and physical and mental task performance.<ref>Donald H.

===Physical===
Physical marks of old age include the following:

*Bone and joint problems: Old bones are marked by "thinning and shrinkage".

===Mental===
Mental marks of old age include the following:

*Agreeability: Despite the stressfulness of old age, the words "agreeable" and "accepting" are used commonly to describe people of old age. However, in some people, the dependence that comes with old age induces feelings of incompetence and worthlessness from having to rely on others for many different basic living functions.<ref name="Berk"/>{{rp|608–9}}
*Caution follows closely with old age. This antipathy toward "risk-taking" often stems from the fact that old people have less to gain and more to lose than younger people.<ref name="posner"/>{{rp|112,116}}
*Depressed mood.<ref>Kennedy G.J. The epidemiology of late-life depression. In: Kennedy G. J, editor. ''Suicide and depression in late life: Critical issues in treatment, research and public policy''. New York: John Wiley and Sons; 1996. pp. 23–37.</ref> According to Cox, [[Lyn Yvonne Abramson|Abramson]], [[Patricia Devine|Devine]], and Hollon (2012), old age is a risk factor for depression caused by prejudice. When younger people are prejudiced against the elderly and then become old themselves, their anti-elderly prejudice turns inward, causing depression.

===Old age===
Early old age can be a pleasant time; children are grown, work is over, and there is time to pursue other interests.<ref name="Berk"/>{{rp|603}} Many old people are also willing to get involved in community and [[Activist ageing|activist organizations]] to promote their well-being. In contrast, perceptions of old age by writers 80+ years old tend to be negative.<ref name="Tor Inge Romoren 2003" />

{{illm|Georges Minois|WD=Q921484}} writes that the first man known to talk about his old age was an Egyptian scribe who lived 4,500 years ago. The scribe addressed God with a prayer of lament:<ref name="Minois">{{cite book |last1=Minois |first1=Georges |title=History of Old Age: From Antiquity to the Renaissance |date=1989 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=9780226530314}}</ref>{{rp|14}}

The bone suffers old age. Good is become evil. All taste is gone. What old age does to men is evil in every respect.<ref name="Minois"/>{{rp|14–5}}}}

Minois comments that the scribe's "cry shows that nothing has changed in the drama of decrepitude between the age of the Pharaoh and the atomic age" and "expresses all the anguish of old people in the past and the present".<ref name="Minois"/>{{rp|14}}

[[Lillian B. Rubin|Lillian Rubin]], active in her 80s as an author, sociologist, and psychotherapist, opens her book ''60 on Up: The Truth about Aging in America'' with "getting old sucks.

====Misconceptions====
Johnson and Barer did a pioneering study of ''Life Beyond 85 Years'' by interviews over a six-year period. In talking with 85-year-olds and older, they found some popular conceptions about old age to be erroneous. Such erroneous conceptions include (1) people in old age have at least one family member for support, (2) old age well-being requires social activity, and (3) "successful adaptation" to age-related changes demands a continuity of self-concept. In their interviews, Johnson and Barer found that 24% of the 85+ had no face-to-face family relationships; many have outlived their families. Second, that contrary to popular notions, the interviews revealed that the reduced activity and socializing of the over-85s does not harm their well-being; they "welcome increased detachment". Third, rather than a continuity of self-concept, as the interviewees faced new situations they changed their "cognitive and emotional processes" and reconstituted their "self–representation".<ref name="cjohnson"/>{{rp|5–6}}

===Societal and historical===

Based on his survey of old age in history, [[:fr:Georges Minois|Georges Minois]] concludes that "it is clear that always and everywhere youth has been preferred to old age". In Western thought, "old age is an evil, an infirmity and a dreary time of preparation for death". Furthermore, death is often preferred over "decrepitude, because death means deliverance".<ref name="Minois" />{{rp|303}}

"The problem of the ambiguity of old age has . . . been with us since the stage of [[Urgesellschaft|primitive society]]; it was both the source of wisdom and of infirmity, experience and decrepitude, of prestige and suffering."<ref name="Minois"/>{{rp|11}}

In the [[Classical antiquity|Classical period]] of Greek and Roman cultures, old age was denigrated as a time of "decline and decrepitude".<ref name="hillier">{{cite book |last1=Hillier |first1=Susan M. |last2=Barrow |first2=Georgia M. |title=Aging, the Individual, and Society |date=2014 |publisher=Cengage |isbn=978-1305176935 |edition=10th}}</ref>{{rp|6–7}} "Beauty and strength" were esteemed and old age was viewed as defiling and ugly. Old age was reckoned as one of the unanswerable "great mysteries" along with evil, pain, and suffering. "Decrepitude, which shrivels heroes, seemed worse than death."<ref name="Minois"/>{{rp|43}}

Historical periods reveal a mixed picture of the "position and status" of old people, but there has never been a "golden age of aging".<ref name="hillier"/>{{rp|6}} Studies have challenged the popular belief that in the past old people were venerated by society and cared for by their families.<ref name=pjohnson>{{cite book |editor1-last=Johnson |editor1-first=Paul |editor2-last=Thane |editor2-first=Pat |title=Old age from Antiquity to Post-modernity |date=1998 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9780415164641 |edition=1st}}</ref>{{rp|1}} Veneration for and antagonism toward the aged have coexisted in complex relationships throughout history.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.answers.com/topic/old-age |title=The Most Trusted Place for Answering Life's Questions |publisher=Answers |access-date=2016-04-04 |archive-date=2016-03-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304081917/http://www.answers.com/topic/old-age |url-status=live }}</ref> "Old people were respected or despised, honoured or put to death according to circumstance."<ref name="Minois"/>{{rp|11}}

Although he was skeptical of the gods, [[Aristotle]] concurred in the dislike of old people. In his ''Ethics'', he wrote that "old people are miserly; they do not acknowledge disinterested friendship; only seeking for what can satisfy their selfish needs".<ref name="Minois"/>{{rp|60}}

The Medieval and Renaissance periods depicted old age as "cruel or weak".<ref name="hillier"/>{{rp|7}}

The 16th-century Utopians [[Thomas More]] and [[Antonio de Guevara]] allowed no decrepit old people in their fictional lands.<ref name="Minois"/>{{rp|277–8, 280}}

For Thomas More, on the island of [[Utopia (More book)|Utopia]], when people are so old as to have "out-lived themselves" and are terminally ill, in pain, and a burden to everyone, the priests exhort them about choosing to die. The priests assure them that "they shall be happy after death". If they choose to die, they end their lives by starvation or by taking opium.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://history-world.org/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041101175649/http://www.history-world.org/|url-status=usurped|archive-date=November 1, 2004|title=World History Project: World History from Mesopotamia to World War II|website=History-world.org|access-date=8 March 2022}}</ref>

[[Antonio de Guevara]]'s utopian nation "had a custom, not to live longer than sixty five years". At that age, they practiced self-immolation. Rather than condemn the practice, Bishop Guevara called it a "golden world" in which people "have overcome the natural appetite to desire to live".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015002444985 |title=The diall of princes: by Don Anthony of Guevara: tr. by Sir Thomas ... – Full View &#124; HathiTrust Digital Library &#124; HathiTrust Digital Library |website=Babel.hathitrust.org |date=2012-08-18 |access-date=2016-04-04}}</ref>

==== Contemporary Perspectives ====
In the Modern period, the "cultural status" of old people has declined in many cultures.<ref name="hillier"/>{{rp|7}} [[Joan Erikson]] observed that "aged individuals are often ostracized, neglected, and overlooked; elders are seen no longer as bearers of wisdom but as embodiments of shame".<ref name="erikson">{{cite book |last1=Erikson |first1=Erik H. |last2=Erikson |first2=Joan M. |title=The Life Cycle Completed: Extended Version |date=1998 |publisher=W.

Attitudes toward old age well being vary somewhat between cultures. For example, in the United States being healthy, physically, and socially active are signs of a good old age.

In Norway, a 20-year longitudinal study of 400 people found that bodily failure and greater dependence became prevalent in the 80+ years. The study calls these years the "fourth age" or "old age in the real meaning of the term". Similarly, the "Berlin Aging Study" rated over-all functionality on four levels: good, medium, poor, and very poor. People in their 70s were mostly rated good. In the 80–90 year range, the four levels of functionality were divided equally. By the 90–100 year range, 60% would be considered frail because of very poor functionality and only 5% still possessed good functionality.<ref name="Tor Inge Romoren 2003"/>

Old age survivors on-average deteriorate from agility in their early retirement years (65-79) to a period of frailty preceding death. This deterioration is gradual for some and precipitous for others. Frailty is marked by an array of [[Chronic (medicine)|chronic]] physical and mental problems which means that frailty is not treatable as a specific disease. These problems coupled with increased dependency in the [[Basic activities of daily living|basic activities of daily living (ADLs)]] required for personal care add emotional problems: depression and anxiety.<ref>Muriel R. Gillick, ''Lifelines: Living Longer, Growing Frail, Taking Heart'' (Norton, 2001), x, xv–xvi, 5–6.</ref> In sum, frailty has been depicted as a group of "complex issues", distinct but "causally interconnected", that often include "comorbid diseases",<ref>"diseases in addition to the primary disease"</ref> progressive weakness, stress, exhaustion, and depression.<ref name="burbank"/>{{rp|25–6}}

According to a study by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), the rate of emergency department visits was consistently highest among patients ages 85 years and older in 2006–2011 in the United States.<ref>{{cite web | vauthors = Skiner HG, Blanchard J, Elixhauser A | title = Trends in Emergency Department Visits, 2006–2011 | work = HCUP Statistical Brief #179 | publisher = Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality | location = Rockville, MD | date = September 2014 | url = https://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/reports/statbriefs/sb179-Emergency-Department-Trends.jsp | access-date = 2014-10-20 | archive-date = 2014-12-24 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20141224224220/http://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/reports/statbriefs/sb179-Emergency-Department-Trends.jsp | url-status = live }}</ref> Additionally, patients aged 65+ had the highest percentage of hospital stays for adults with multiple chronic conditions but the second highest percentage of hospital costs in 2003–2014.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Steiner CA, Barett ML, Weiss AJ, Andrews RM | title = Trends and Projections in Hospital Stays for Adults With Multiple Chronic Conditions, 2003–2014 | journal = HCUP Statistical Brief #183 | publisher = Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality | location = Rockville, MD | date = November 2014 | pmid = 25558764 | url = https://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/reports/statbriefs/sb183-Hospitalizations-Multiple-Chronic-Conditions-Projections-2014.jsp | access-date = 2015-04-06 | archive-date = 2015-04-11 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150411221039/https://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/reports/statbriefs/sb183-Hospitalizations-Multiple-Chronic-Conditions-Projections-2014.jsp | url-status = live }}</ref>

===Death===
Old age, death, and frailty are linked because approximately half the deaths in old age are preceded by months or years of frailty.<ref name="burbank"/>{{rp|3, 19}}

''Older Adults' Views on Death'' is based on interviews with 109 people in the 70–90 age range, with a mean age of 80.7. Almost 20% of the people wanted to use whatever treatment that might postpone death. About the same number said that, given a terminal illness, they would choose [[assisted suicide]]. Roughly half chose doing nothing except live day by day until death comes naturally without medical or other intervention designed to prolong life. This choice was coupled with a desire to receive [[palliative care]] if needed.<ref name="cicirelli"/>{{rp|6–7, 9, 12, 32}}

About half of older adults have [[multimorbidity]], that is, they have three or more chronic conditions.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/geriatric_medicine_gerontology/aging_research/health_services_research/multimorbidity.html |title= Multimorbidity &#124; Johns Hopkins Geriatric Medicine and Gerontology |website= Hopkinsmedicine.org |date= 2011-06-24 |access-date= 2016-04-04 |archive-date= 2016-04-17 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160417030929/http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/geriatric_medicine_gerontology/aging_research/health_services_research/multimorbidity.html |url-status= live }}</ref> Medical advances have made it possible to "postpone death", but in many cases this postponement adds "prolonged sickness, dependence, pain, and suffering", a time that is costly in social, psychological, and economic terms.<ref name="logue"/>{{rp|18, 72}}

The longitudinal interviews of 150 age 85+ people summarized in ''Life Beyond 85 Years'' found "progressive terminal decline" in the year prior to death: constant fatigue, much sleep, detachment from people, things, and activities, simplified lives. Most of the interviewees did not fear death; some would welcome it. One person said, "Living this long is pure hell."
However, nearly everyone feared a long process of dying. Some wanted to die in their sleep; others wanted to die "on their feet".<ref name="cjohnson"/>{{rp|202–7}}

The study of ''Older Adults' Views on Death'' found that the more frail people were, the more "pain, suffering, and struggles" they were enduring, the more likely they were to "accept and welcome" death as a release from their misery. Their fear about the process of dying was that it would prolong their distress. Besides being a release from misery, some saw death as a way to reunion with departed loved ones. Others saw death as a way to free their caretakers from the burden of their care.<ref name="cicirelli"/>{{rp|55, 270, 276}}

The number of old people is growing around the world chiefly because of the [[post–World War II baby boom]] and increases in the provision and standards of health care.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/worldageing19502050/ |title=World Population Ageing |website=Un.org |access-date=2016-04-04 |archive-date=2018-10-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181023194531/http://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/worldageing19502050/ |url-status=live }}</ref> By 2050, 33% of the developed world's population and almost 20% of the less developed world's population will be over 60 years old.<ref>John Bond and others, editors, ''Ageing in Society'' (Sage, 2007 3rd ed), 1.</ref>

The growing number of people living to their 80s and 90s in the developed world has strained public welfare systems and has also resulted in increased incidence of diseases like cancer and dementia that were rarely seen in premodern times. When the United States Social Security program was created, people older than 65 numbered only around 5% of the population and the average life expectancy of a 65-year-old in 1936 was approximately 5 years, while in 2011 it could often range from 10 to 20 years. Other issues that can arise from an increasing population are growing demands for health care and an increase in demand for different types of services.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/ssb/v66n1/v66n1p1.html |title=Social Security: A Program and Policy History |website=Ssa.gov |access-date=2016-04-04 |archive-date=2016-04-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160414233144/https://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/ssb/v66n1/v66n1p1.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

==Psychosocial aspects==
[[File:BuddhistMonk02.jpg|thumb|upright|An elderly [[Khmer people|Khmer]] woman]]
According to [[Erik Erikson]]'s [[Erikson's stages of psychosocial development|"Stages of Psychosocial Development"]], the human personality is developed in a series of eight stages that take place from the time of birth and continue on throughout an individual's complete life. He characterises old age as a period of "Integrity vs. Despair", during which people focus on reflecting back on their lives. Those who are unsuccessful during this phase will feel that their life has been wasted and will experience many regrets. The individual will be left with feelings of bitterness and despair. Those who feel proud of their accomplishments will feel a sense of integrity. Successfully completing this phase means looking back with few regrets and a general feeling of satisfaction. These individuals will attain wisdom, even when confronting death.<ref>Erikson, E.H. (1968). ''Identity: Youth and Crisis''. New York: Norton.</ref><ref>Erikson, E.H. (1963). ''[[Childhood and Society]]''. (2nd ed.). New York: Norton.</ref><ref>Carver, C.S. & Scheir, M.F. (2000). ''Perspectives on Personality''. Needham Heights, MA: Allyn & Bacon</ref> Coping is a very important skill needed in the aging process to move forward with life and not be 'stuck' in the past. The way people adapt and cope, reflects their aging process on a psycho-social level.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ot.creighton.edu/community/OT_FOR_ELDERS/3rd_Edition_Chapters/Proofs/Padilla_Chapter_04_main.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-12-18 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131219021259/http://ot.creighton.edu/community/OT_FOR_ELDERS/3rd_Edition_Chapters/Proofs/Padilla_Chapter_04_main.pdf |archive-date=2013-12-19 }}</ref>

For people in their 80s and 90s, [[Joan Erikson]] added a ninth stage in ''The Life Cycle Completed: Extended Version''.<ref name="erikson"/> As she wrote, she added the ninth stage because the Integrity of the eighth stage imposes "a serious demand on the senses of elders" and the Wisdom of the eighth stage requires capacities that ninth stage elders "do not usually have".<ref name="erikson"/>{{rp|112–3}}

Newman & Newman also proposed a ninth stage of life, Elderhood. Elderhood refers to those individuals who live past the life expectancy of their birth cohorts. They described two different types of people in this stage of life. The "young old" are the healthy individuals who can function on their own without assistance and can complete their daily tasks independently, while the "old old" are those who depend on specific services due to declining health or diseases.<ref>Barbara M. Newman, Philip R. Newman, ''Development Through Life: A Psychosocial Approach: A Psychosocial Approach'' (Cengage Learning, 2011), Ch 13 "Later Adulthood (60–75 Years)" and Ch 14, "Elderhood (75 until death)".</ref>

===Theories===
[[File:Habibaadansalat.jpg|thumb|An elderly [[Somali people|Somali]] woman]]
[[File:Walking style of an aged woman on road.jpg|thumb|An elderly woman walks along a road.]]
Social theories, or concepts,<ref>"Theory: A conception . . . of something to be done, or of the method of doing it." ''Oxford English Dictionary Online ''. December 2013.</ref> propose explanations for the distinctive relationships between old people and their societies.

One theory, proposed in 1961, is the [[disengagement theory]], which proposes that, in old age, a mutual disengagement between people and their society occurs in anticipation of death. By becoming disengaged from work and family responsibilities, according to this concept, people are enabled to enjoy their old age without stress. This theory has been subjected to the criticism that old age disengagement is neither natural, inevitable, nor beneficial.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sciences360.com/index.php/an-overview-of-cumming-and-henrys-social-disengagement-theory-3750/|title=An Overview of Cumming and Henrys Social Disengagement Theory by Michael Totten|website=Sciences360.com|access-date=8 March 2022|archive-date=8 March 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220308202307/https://www.sciences360.com/index.php/an-overview-of-cumming-and-henrys-social-disengagement-theory-3750/|url-status=live}}</ref> Furthermore, disengaging from social ties in old age is not across the board: unsatisfactory ties are dropped and satisfying ones kept.<ref name="Berk"/>{{rp|613}}

In opposition to the disengagement theory, the [[activity theory (aging)|activity theory]] of old age argues that disengagement in old age occurs not by desire, but by the barriers to social engagement imposed by society. This theory has been faulted for not factoring in psychological changes that occur in old age as shown by reduced activity, even when available. It has also been found that happiness in old age is not proportional to activity.<ref name="Berk"/>{{rp|614}}

According to the [[continuity theory]], in spite of the inevitable differences imposed by their old age, most people try to maintain continuity in personhood, activities, and relationships with their younger days.<ref name="Berk"/>{{rp|614}}

[[Socioemotional selectivity theory]] also depicts how people maintain continuity in old age. The focus of this theory is continuity sustained by social networks, albeit networks narrowed by choice and by circumstances. The choice is for more harmonious relationships. The circumstances are loss of relationships by death and distance.<ref name="Berk"/>{{rp|614–5}}

==Life expectancy==
[[Life expectancy]] by nation at birth in the year 2011 ranged from 48 years to 82. Low values indicate high death rates for infants and children.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wdi.worldbank.org/table/2.21 |title=World Development Indicators &#124; The World Bank |website=Wdi.worldbank.org |access-date=2016-04-04 |archive-date=2016-04-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160404142610/http://wdi.worldbank.org/table/2.21 |url-status=live }}</ref>

In most parts of the world women live, on average, longer than men; even so, the disparities vary between 12 years in Russia to no difference or higher life expectancy for men in countries such as Zimbabwe and Uganda.<ref>de Blij, Harm. The power of place. Geography, Destiny, and Globalization's Rough Landscape. [[Oxford University Press]]. London:2009. p161ff</ref>

The number of elderly people worldwide began to surge in the second half of the 20th century. In developed countries before then, five or less percent of the population was over 65. Few lived longer than their 70s and people who attained advanced age (i.e. their 80s) were rare enough to be a novelty and were revered as wise sages. The worldwide over-65 population in 1960 was one-third of the under-5 population. By 2013, the over-65 population had grown to equal the under-5 population and is projected to double the under-5 population by 2050.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.who.int/ageing/publications/global_health.pdf|title=Global health and aging|website=Who.int|access-date=8 March 2022|archive-date=16 January 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210116063301/https://www.who.int/ageing/publications/global_health.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref>

Before the surge in the over-65 population, accidents and disease claimed many people before they could attain old age, and health problems in those over 65 meant a quick death in most cases. If a person lived to an advanced age, it was due to genetic factors and/or a relatively easy lifestyle, since diseases of old age could not be treated before the 20th century.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.who.int/whr/2004/annex/topic/en/annex_2_en.pdf|title=The World Health Report 2004 : Annex Table 2 Deaths by cause, sex and mortality stratum in WHO regions,a estimates for 2002|website=Who.int|access-date=8 March 2022|archive-date=7 March 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210307013416/https://www.who.int/whr/2004/annex/topic/en/annex_2_en.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref>

Full retirement age for Social Security benefits for people retiring in 2012 is age 66.<ref name="socialsecurity.gov">{{cite web|url=http://www.socialsecurity.gov/pubs/retirechart.htm|title=Age To Receive Full Social Security Retirement Benefits|publisher=[[Social Security Administration|U.S. Social SecurityAdministration]]|access-date=6 June 2011|archive-date=4 June 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604191541/http://www.socialsecurity.gov/pubs/retirechart.htm|url-status=live}}</ref> In the United Kingdom, the state pension age for men and women will rise to 66 in 2020 with further increases scheduled after that.

Originally, the purpose of old age pensions was to prevent elderly people from being reduced to beggary, which is still common in some underdeveloped countries, but growing life expectancies and older populations have brought into question the model under which pension systems were designed.<ref>James H. Schulz and Robert H. Binstock, Aging Nation: The Economics and Politics of Growing Older in America (Johns Hopkins, 2008). 3–4.</ref> By 1990, the United States was spending 30 per cent of its budget on the elderly, compared with 2 per cent on education.<ref>{{Cite magazine|title = U.S. spending|date = April 19, 1990|magazine = [[Rolling Stone]]|page = 43}}</ref> The dominant perception of the American old age population changed from "needy" and "worthy" to "powerful" and "greedy", old people getting more than their share of the nation's resources.<ref>Laura Katz Olson, ''The Not-so-golden Years: Caregiving, the Frail Elderly, and the Long-term Care Establishment'' (Rowman and Littlefield, 2003), 4.</ref> However, in 2011, using a Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM), the old age American poverty rate was measured as 15.9%.<ref name="autogenerated3"/>

==Assistance: devices and personal==

In the United States in 2008, 11 million people aged 65+ lived alone: 5 million or 22% of ages 65–74, 4 million or 34% of ages 75–84, and 2 million or 41% of ages 85+. The 2007 gender breakdown for all people 65+ was men 19% and women 39%.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://longevity3.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/New-Realities-of-an-Older-America.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-12-30 |archive-date=2013-12-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131230233714/http://longevity3.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/New-Realities-of-an-Older-America.pdf |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Many new assistive devices made especially for the home have enabled more old people to care for their own [[activities of daily living]] (ADL). Some examples of devices are a medical alert and safety system, shower seat (making it so the person does not get tired in the shower and fall), a bed cane (offering support to those with unsteadiness getting in and out of bed) and an ADL cuff (used with eating utensils for people with paralysis or hand weakness).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.info.gov.hk/elderly/english/healthinfo/elderly/assistivedevices-e.htm |title=Elderly Health Service |access-date=December 30, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130831094556/http://www.info.gov.hk/elderly/english/healthinfo/elderly/assistivedevices-e.htm |archive-date=August 31, 2013 }}</ref>

A Swedish study found that at age 76, 46% of the subjects used assistive devices. When they reached age 86, 69% used them. The subjects were ambivalent regarding the use of the assistive devices: as "enablers" or as "disablers".<ref>{{cite journal|title=Use of assistive devices – a reality full of contradictions in elderly persons' everyday life|first1=Greta|last1=Häggblom-Kronlöf|first2=Ulla|last2=Sonn|date=1 January 2007|volume=2|issue=6|pages=335–345|doi=10.1080/17483100701701672|journal=[[Disability and Rehabilitation: Assistive Technology]]|pmid=19263564|s2cid=35215512}}</ref> People who view assistive devices as enabling greater independence accept and use them, whereas those who see them as symbols of disability reject them.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.homemods.org/resources/pages/accept.shtml |title=Home Modifications |website=Homemods.org |access-date=2016-04-04 |archive-date=2016-04-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160426143627/http://www.homemods.org/resources/pages/accept.shtml |url-status=live }}</ref> However, [[organization]]s like [[Love for the Elderly]] aim to combat such age-related prejudice by educating the public about the importance of appreciating growing older, while also providing services of kindness to elders in senior homes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lovefortheelderly.org/|title=Love for the Elderly|website=Lovefortheelderly.org|access-date=2017-02-16|archive-date=2017-03-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170318055012/http://www.lovefortheelderly.org/|url-status=live}}</ref>

Even with assistive devices as of 2006, 8.5 million Americans needed personal assistance because of impaired [[basic activities of daily living]] required for personal care or impaired [[instrumental activities of daily living]] (IADL) required for independent living. Projections place this number at 21 million by 2030 when 40% of Americans over 70 will need assistance.<ref name="burbank"/>{{rp|17}} There are many options for such long-term care to those who require it.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Scanlon |first=W.

In 2014, a documentary film called ''[[The Age of Love (2014 film)|The Age of Love]]'' used humor and the poignant adventures of 30 seniors who attend a speed dating event for 70 to 90-year-olds and discover how the search for romance changes—or does not change—from childhood to old age.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2015/feb/02/documentary-tracks-seniors-in-search-of-love/ |title=Documentary tracks seniors in search of love |work=The Spokesman-Review |date=2015-02-02 |access-date=2015-07-06 |archive-date=2015-07-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150706230838/http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2015/feb/02/documentary-tracks-seniors-in-search-of-love/ |url-status=live }}</ref>
