{{2018 Asian Games}}
A number of concerns and controversies surfaced before and during the [[2018 Asian Games]] in [[Jakarta]] and [[Palembang]], [[Indonesia]].

==Prior to the Games==
[[File:TJW 10012.jpg|right|thumb|340x340px|Several numbers of bus shelters on the Jendral Sudirman Road, Jakarta was separated from the main road by a green corridor that was made to grow plants, and trees during the main road's sidewalk revitalization for the Asian Games. The green corridor disturbs the operational of feeder and double decker bus services that stops on the separated bus shelters. Eventually, a ramp was built to connect between the main road and the separated bus shelters.]]

Jakarta, consistently ranked as having one of the world's worst traffic congestion problems, was [[Jakarta MRT|building a subway]]. However, it would not be ready until 2019, so organizers had proposed closing schools during the event to curb traffic from millions of commuting pupils. Authorities also proposed to set aside toll roads and bus lanes for special official and athlete use during the Games. Jakarta has also instated an [[Odd–even rationing|odd-even licence plate system]] to limit congestion.<ref name="Davies 2018">{{Cite news |last=Davies |first=Ed |last2=Silviana |first2=Cindy |last3=Damiana |first3=Jessica |date=8 March 2018 |title=Indonesia confident on Asian Games preparations, traffic concerns remain |language= |work=Reuters |editor-last=O’Brien |editor-first=John |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-games-asia-indonesia/indonesia-confident-on-asian-games-preparations-traffic-concerns-remain-idUSKCN1GK1CC |access-date=21 July 2018}}</ref>

The sidewalk of the Jendral Sudirman Road ''(Jalan Jendral Sudirman)'', the main corridor of the heart of Jakarta was having a revitalization. The revitalization is the preparation of the operational of the [[Jakarta MRT|new subway network]] and the Asian Games. The sidewalk revitalization construction at the main road was overall uneven. Some parts of the sidewalks was finished, while the others  was not finished yet. What became the center of attention is the condition of the bus stop at the front of the [[Gelora Bung Karno Sports Complex|main venue]] of the games. The bus stop shelter was separated from the road by a corridor of grass which is the part of the new sidewalk. But eventually, a ramp was built to connect between the shelter and the road.

Air pollution also became a concern in both cities. Jakarta has long struggled to boost air quality, regularly rated as unsafe by the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) as Jakarta's average score on the Air Quality Index (AQI) had exceeded 100 during early July 2018, once reaching the "unhealthy" range at 171 on 11 AM, Tuesday, 17 July 2018. Palembang also had been constantly under risk of [[haze]] caused by peatland fire during dry season which coincides with the Games. Authorities are looking into the possibility of [[cloud seeding]] to combat the fire hotspots by triggering rainfall in dry areas with flares of salt shot into suitable clouds.<ref>{{Cite news |date=2018-07-17 |title=From cloud seeding to vehicle curbs, Indonesia fights pollution ahead of Asian Games |language=en |work=Reuters |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-games-asia-pollution-idUKKBN1K713D |access-date=2023-07-14}}</ref> Authorities covered a polluted, foul-smelling river near the Asian Games [[Kemayoran Athletes Village|athletes' village in Jakarta]] with black nylon mesh over fears it will be an eyesore at the showpiece event.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Lamb |first=Kate |date=2018-07-26 |title=Cover-up: Jakarta hides foul river with giant net before Asian Games |language=en-GB |work=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/jul/26/cover-up-jakarta-hides-foul-river-with-giant-net-before-asian-games |access-date=2023-07-14 |issn=0261-3077}}</ref>

Security is another concern, with the Games taking place just a few months after [[Surabaya bombings|a series of terror attacks]], which killed dozens of people and provoked fear over Islamist militants. Some 100,000 security staff including bomb squad and sniper teams will be deployed in Jakarta, [[Palembang]], and [[West Java]], where the majority of events are hosted. Local police said they have been taking part in a pre-Asian Games crackdown on terror suspects and petty street criminals.<ref name="Davies 2018" /><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://en.vietnamplus.vn/asian-games-2018-risks-of-traffic-jam-and-terror-attack-concern-organisers/134883.vnp|title=Asian Games 2018: Risks of traffic jam and terror attack concern organisers|date=18 July 2018|work=vietnamplus.vn|access-date=21 July 2018}}.</ref>

The [[Olympic Council of Malaysia]] (OCM) also raised concerns over [[Malaysia national football team|Malaysian men's U-16 national football team]] security issues due to the recent provocations by Indonesian fans at venues and on social media,<ref>{{Cite news |last=Peter |first=Fabian |date=August 1, 2018 |title=OCM look into athletes' safety at Asian Games |language=en-US |work=New Straits Times |url=https://www.nst.com.my/amp/sports/others/2018/08/396949/ocm-look-athletes-safety-asian-games |access-date=5 August 2018}}</ref> it was initially triggered after Malaysia won at the [[2018 AFF U-19 Youth Championship]] at [[East Java]].<ref>{{Cite news |last=Midaada |first=Avirista |date=2018-07-27 |title=Timnya Dilempari, Pelatih Malaysia Kecam Sikap Suporter Timnas Indonesia U-19 |language=id-ID |work=Okezone.com |url=https://bola.okezone.com/read/2018/07/13/51/1921746/timnya-dilempari-pelatih-malaysia-kecam-sikap-suporter-timnas-indonesia-u-19 |access-date=2018-08-28}}</ref> When the penalty shoot-out ended with a score 3–2 against the host, dissatisfied Indonesian supporters to throw bottles and rocks at the Malaysian team after their team failed to qualify to the finals which caused the Malaysian team to run to their dressing room for safety.<ref>{{cite web |author=Thiagarajan |first=Tara |date=13 July 2018 |title=Indonesian Fans Throw Rocks at M'sian Under-19 Team After Being Defeated 3-2 |url=https://www.worldofbuzz.com/indonesian-fans-throw-rocks-at-msian-under-19-team-after-being-defeated-3-2/ |access-date=15 July 2018 |publisher=World of Buzz}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/stones-bottles-hurled-at-malaysian-football-team-in-indonesia-10527318|title=Stones, bottles hurled at Malaysian football team in Indonesia: Report|publisher=Channel NewsAsia|date=13 July 2018|access-date=15 July 2018|archive-date=15 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180715093812/https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/stones-bottles-hurled-at-malaysian-football-team-in-indonesia-10527318|url-status=dead}}</ref>

On 21 July 2018, less than one month from the Games, women football venue of [[Gelora Sriwijaya Stadium]] in Palembang had been partially damaged in a riot during local football league. At least 335 seats had been destroyed by the mob.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Putra |first=Aji |date=21 July 2018 |title=Kecewa dengan Manajemen, Suporter Sriwijaya FC Rusak Kursi Stadion |language=en |work=KOMPAS.com |editor-last=Gonsaga |editor-first=Aloysius |url=https://bola.kompas.com/read/2018/07/21/20005778/kecewa-dengan-manajemen-suporter-sriwijaya-fc-rusak-kursi-stadion |access-date=21 July 2018}}</ref>

Officials had held Asian Games' men football tournament drawing three times due to protest from UAE and Palestine which were incidentally not included in the first drawing. Later, Iraq withdrew from tournament which forced officials to rebalance the groups by determining which of Palestine or UAE would be moved to Group C to replace Iraq.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.insidethegames.biz/articles/1068349/draw-for-asian-games-football-tournament-held-for-third-time|title=Draw for Asian Games football tournament held for third time|last=Mackay|first=Duncan|date=4 August 2018|work=insidethegames.biz|access-date=7 August 2018}}</ref>

Prior to the start of the [[Golf at the 2018 Asian Games|golf tournament of the Asian Games]], several national golf associations complained to the [[Court of Arbitration for Sport]] that Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Macau and Uzbekistan had possibly entered professional golfers, but the CAS ruled that none of the players were professional as the golf tournament was reserved only for the amateur players.<ref>{{cite news |last=Tarrant |first=Jack |date=24 August 2018 |title=Games-CAS satisfied Asian Games golfers aren't professional |work=Reuters |editor-last=Radnedge |editor-first=Christian |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/games-asia-golf/asian-games-cas-satisfied-asian-games-golfers-arent-professional-idINKCN1L719Y}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Careem|first=Nazvi|date=23 August 2018|title=Asian Games: pros cut from Sri Lanka golf squad after Hong Kong and others complain about breach of amateur rules|url=https://www.scmp.com/sport/golf/article/2160924/asian-games-pros-cut-sri-lanka-golf-squad-after-hong-kong-and-others|work=[[South China Morning Post]]|location=Hong Kong, China|access-date=24 August 2018}}</ref>

==During the Games==

===Alcohol ban===
The Indonesian Asian Games Organizing Committee ([[Indonesian Olympic Committee|INASGOC]]) banned athletes competing in the Games from consuming alcohol and outside food in their accommodation in the host cities of Jakarta and Palembang. On 28 August 2018, officials said they had confiscated many bottles and cans of beer that athletes and officials had tried to bring in from outside the athletes' villages.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Potkin|first1=Fanny|title=No Drowning Your Sorrows: Indonesia Bans Alcohol at Athletes' Villages|url=http://jakartaglobe.id/news/no-drowning-sorrows-indonesia-bans-alcohol-athletes-villages/|access-date=30 August 2018|agency=Reuters|publisher=Jakarta Globe|date=28 August 2018}}</ref>

===Alleged gratification===

===Basketball===
Coach [[Yeng Guiao]] of the [[Philippines men's national basketball team|Philippine men's National Basketball team]] raised doubts as to why a Hong Kong referee officiated the match up between China and the Philippines. Despite having its own organized sports body, [[Hong Kong]] is a special administrative region of China. He questioned the number of China's free throw attempts to the Philippines', 39 foul shots to 15. The Chinese team was assessed to only 16 fouls compared to the Philippines, 25.<ref>{{cite news |author=Henson |first=Joaquin |date=23 August 2018 |title=No excuses but Yeng Guiao calls out Hong Kong referee |work=Philippine Star |url=https://www.philstar.com/sports/2018/08/23/1845139/no-excuses-yeng-guiao-calls-out-hong-kong-referee#L99T6ZcO1ydb21Xv.99 |access-date=24 August 2018}}</ref>

===Boxing===
In women's 57&nbsp;kg, Filipino boxer Nesthy Petecio lost a controversial bout against Chinese rival Yin Junhua  to the surprise of most of the crowd at the Jakarta International Expo Hall C.

The French judge scored a 28–28, but later handed the fight to the Chinese to break the deadlock. Petecio shed tears of anger and stared at the judges. Philippine chef de mission [[Richard Gomez]] said it's a case of “bad call, bad decision and bad scoring” while [[Association of Boxing Alliances in the Philippines]] (ABAP) executive director Ed Picson blasted the result of the bout and appeals to officials “that the judges responsible for this travesty not be assigned to officiate in the coming Philippines fights as judges or referees.”<ref>{{cite news |author=Beltran |first=Nelson |date=25 August 2018 |title=Petecio, Phl sports officials cry foul |work=The Philippine Star |url=https://www.philstar.com/sports/2018/08/25/1845769/petecio-phl-sports-officials-cry-foul |access-date=28 August 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Naredo |first=Camille B. |date=25 August 2018 |title=Asian Games: Protests not possible, but PH boxing exec wants judges banned |work=ABS-CBN News |url=https://news.abs-cbn.com/sports/08/25/18/asian-games-protests-not-possible-but-ph-boxing-exec-wants-judges-banned |access-date=28 August 2018}}</ref>

===Football===

[[Luis Milla (footballer, born 1966)|Luis Milla]], the head coach of [[Indonesia national under-23 football team|Indonesian men's national football team]] called the referee Shaun Evans from Australia 'unfit' after he gave two controversial penalties during a game between Indonesia and the United Arab Emirates. Milla was disappointed because the referee was biased during the whole game. "The referee doesn't have any competence to officiate at the Asian Games. He [Shaun Evans] is not on that level. He's the [opponent’s] 12th player and I am sad that our players' struggle had to end like this," the Spanish coach said. The Indonesian goalkeeper, [[Andritany Ardhiyasa]], added at the press conference, "Today is a sad day for us because we were robbed by [the referee]. The second penalty should not have been awarded".<ref>{{cite news |author=Sidiq |first=Fachrul |date=24 August 2018 |title=Asian Games: UAE eliminates Indonesia in round of 16 soccer match |work=Jakarta Post |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2018/08/24/asian-games-uae-eliminates-indonesia-in-round-of-16-soccer-match.html |access-date=20 August 2018}}</ref>
