'''William Robert Guerin''' (born November 9, 1970) is an American former professional [[ice hockey]] player and the current general manager of the [[Minnesota Wild]]. He previously was the assistant general manager of the [[Pittsburgh Penguins]] and general manager of the [[Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins]].

Guerin played 18 [[season (sports)|seasons]] in the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL), winning two [[Stanley Cup]] championships with the [[New Jersey Devils]] and Pittsburgh Penguins.

Internationally, Guerin represented the [[USA Hockey|United States]] in the Olympics in [[Ice hockey at the 1998 Winter Olympics|1998]], [[Ice hockey at the 2002 Winter Olympics|2002]] and [[Ice hockey at the 2006 Winter Olympics –&nbsp;Men's tournament|2006]], and participated in two [[Ice Hockey World Championships]]. Guerin is the first player of [[Hispanic]] descent to play in the NHL.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cbssports.com/nhl/story/10582867 |title=NHL diversity milestones |publisher=CBSSports.com |date=March 20, 2014 |access-date=March 26, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121015121424/http://www.cbssports.com/nhl/story/10582867 |archive-date=October 15, 2012 }}</ref><ref name=CHL>{{cite web |url=http://www.centralhockeyleague.com/pressroom/index.html?article_id=328 |title=The Center Of Hockey: Press Room |publisher=Centralhockeyleague.com |access-date=March 26, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140302231624/http://www.centralhockeyleague.com/pressroom/index.html?article_id=328 |archive-date=March 2, 2014}}</ref>

==Playing career==

===Professional===
[[File:Bill Guerin.jpg|left|thumb|Guerin during his time as [[New York Islanders|Islanders]] [[Captain (ice hockey)|captain]]]]
Guerin was drafted in the [[1989 NHL Entry Draft]] fifth overall by the [[New Jersey Devils]] and played with the team from 1991 to 1998, winning the [[1995 Stanley Cup Finals|Stanley Cup in 1995]]. Midway through the [[1997–98 NHL season|1997–98 season]], Guerin was traded (along with [[Valeri Zelepukin]]) to the [[Edmonton Oilers]] in exchange for [[Jason Arnott]] and [[Bryan Muir]].

In November 2001 Guerin was traded to his hometown team, the [[Boston Bruins]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://oilersnation.com/2022/01/12/bill-guerin-found-out-the-edmonton-oilers-traded-him-from-some-random-dude-at-west-edmonton-mall/|title = Bill Guerin found out the Edmonton Oilers traded him from some random dude at West Edmonton Mall|date = January 12, 2022}}</ref>

After a 41-goal season in [[2001–02 NHL season|2001–02]], Guerin left the Bruins as a free agent and signed a five-year contract with the [[Dallas Stars]].<ref name="Stars">{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/story/2002/07/04/guerin020703.html|title=Bill Guerin bolts Bruins for Stars|access-date=February 28, 2007|publisher=CBC.ca| date=September 18, 2002}}</ref> He performed below expectations during his tenure with the Stars. After a disappointing season in [[2005–06 NHL season|2005–06]] in which he recorded just 40 points, Dallas opted to buy-out the remainder of his contract. The conditions of buyouts in the NHL meant that the Stars would have to pay him two-thirds of the remaining salary on his contract spread out over twice as many years; this meant $6.7&nbsp;million over one year became $4.4&nbsp;million over two years.

On July 3, 2006, Guerin signed a one-year, $2&nbsp;million contract with the [[St. Louis Blues]].<ref name="Blues">{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/news/story?id=2508904|title=Blues sign veteran forward Guerin to one-year deal|access-date=February 28, 2007|work=ESPN.com|year=2006}}</ref> Playing on a line with former Oiler teammate [[Doug Weight]], Guerin revived his career, easily eclipsing his disappointing goal-scoring mark from the 2005–06 season. He was named to the [[2007 National Hockey League All-Star Game|2007 All-Star Game]] (hosted by the Stars) to represent the Blues. Despite numerous criticisms of his play during his time as a Star, Guerin received a standing ovation from the Dallas fans in recognition as his status as a longtime fan favorite.

On February 2, 2007, Guerin became the [[List of NHL players with 1,000 games played|214th NHL player to play in 1,000 games]].<ref name="Thousand games">{{cite web |url=http://www.stltoday.com/stltoday/sports/stories.nsf/blues/story/E6C5944C825A532A86257276001921BE?OpenDocument |title=Blue Notes: Guerin hits 1,000 games tonight |access-date=February 28, 2007 |publisher=St. Louis Post-Dispatch |year=2007 |author=Rutherford, Jeremy |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070207050217/http://www.stltoday.com/stltoday/sports/stories.nsf/blues/story/e6c5944c825a532a86257276001921be?opendocument |archive-date=February 7, 2007 }}</ref> Later that month, he was traded to the [[San Jose Sharks]]<ref name="Sharks">{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2007/SPORT/02/28/nhl.trades/|title= Guerin switches to San Jose Sharks|access-date=February 28, 2007|publisher=CNN.com|year=2007}}</ref> in exchange for [[Ville Nieminen]], prospect Jay Barriball and a conditional first-round pick (either New Jersey's in [[2007 NHL Entry Draft|2007]] or San Jose's in [[2008 NHL Entry Draft|2008]]).

On March 4, 2009, Guerin was traded to the [[Pittsburgh Penguins]] in exchange for a conditional draft pick. The pick, a [[2009 NHL Entry Draft|2009]] fourth-round pick if the Penguins made the playoffs, was later turned into a 2009 third-round pick once the Penguins advanced to the second round of the [[2009 Stanley Cup playoffs]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/nhl/news;_ylt=Aj7OMfrCc7uNfwmjd0jrfm5Q2bYF?slug=txpenguinsguerinislanders&prov=st&type=lgns|title=Penguins acquire C Guerin|date=March 4, 2009}}</ref> Guerin won the [[Stanley Cup]] on June 12, 2009, with the Penguins, defeating the [[Detroit Red Wings]] by a final score of 2–1 for [[2009 Stanley Cup Finals#Game seven|Game 7]] at [[Joe Louis Arena]]. His 14 years between Stanley Cups as a player was the third-longest wait in NHL history, behind [[Chris Chelios]] (16) and [[Mark Recchi]] (15).

After vocal encouragement for his return from the crowd and teammates at Pittsburgh's Stanley Cup parade on June 15, as well as expressing his own affection for the city and team, Guerin signed a one-year contract extension with the Penguins on June 29 at a greatly reduced salary to play through the [[2009–10 NHL season|2009–10 season]]. He became the first player to have a 20-goal season with seven different teams and one of only three to have a 20-goal season with five or more different teams (the two others being [[Eddie Shack]] and [[Ray Sheppard]]). [[Ray Shero]], the general manager for the Penguins opted not to offer Guerin a contract for the [[2010–11 NHL season|2010–11 season]]. On September 7, 2010, the [[Philadelphia Flyers]] invited Guerin to try out at training camp, but on October 4, the Flyers released him prior to the start of the regular season.

On December 6, 2010, Guerin announced his retirement as a player from the NHL as a Pittsburgh Penguin.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://penguins.nhl.com/club/news.htm?id=545496& | title = Billy Guerin to Retire "As a Pittsburgh Penguin" | publisher = PittsburghPenguins.com | date = December 6, 2010 | access-date = December 6, 2010}}</ref> At the time of his retirement, Guerin ranked seventh all-time among Americans in the NHL with 429 goals.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/hockey/nhl/2010-12-06-bill-guerin-retires_N.htm | work=USA Today | first=Mike | last=Brehm | title=Bill Guerin announces retirement after 18 NHL seasons | date=December 6, 2010}}</ref>

==Management career==
On June 6, 2011, the Penguins hired Guerin as their player development coach.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://penguins.nhl.com/club/news.htm?id=565196|title=Penguins Name Bill Guerin Player Development Coach}}</ref> On June 6, 2014, Penguins general manager [[Jim Rutherford]] announced that Guerin would be promoted to assistant general manager of the team. Rutherford said that Guerin would be focusing on developing the analytical side of the game. Following consecutive Stanley Cup triumphs in 2016 and 2017, the Penguins announced that Guerin's duties would expand to include the role of general manager of their [[American Hockey League]] (AHL) affiliate, the [[Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins]], made vacant via the departure of [[Jason Botterill]] to the NHL's [[Buffalo Sabres]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Pittsburgh tabs Bill Guerin as new GM of WBS Penguins |url=http://timesleader.com/sports/663479/pittsburgh-tabs-bill-guerin-named-as-new-gm-of-wbs-penguins |website=Times Leader |date=June 15, 2017 |access-date=June 16, 2017}}</ref>

On August 21, 2019, Guerin was named the fourth general manager of the [[Minnesota Wild]].<ref>{{cite web |title=New GM Guerin arrives in Minnesota with winning pedigree |url=https://www.nhl.com/wild/news/guerin-proven-winner-082119/c-308587972|website=NHL.com |access-date=August 21, 2019}}</ref>
On March 21, 2022, Guerin was named the [[The Sports Network|TSN]] TradeCentre GM of the Day, for his transactions at the [[2021–22 NHL transactions|2022 NHL Trade Deadline]].
