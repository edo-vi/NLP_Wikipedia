The aetiological agent of '''turkey viral hepatitis''' is a virus from the ''[[Picornaviridae]]'' family.

The disease is restricted to [[Turkey (bird)|turkeys]] and is highly contagious but usually [[subclinical]]. It is usually present in young birds under the age of 6 weeks.

It has been seen in Canada, Italy, the US and the UK.

Transmission is thought to be via the [[Fecalâ€“oral route|faeces]] and [[vertical transmission]] may also occur.

==Clinical signs and diagnosis==
Affected turkeys may show systemic signs such as [[Anorexia (symptom)|anorexia]], [[lethargy]] and death. [[Hepatic encephalopathy]] occurs secondary to liver involvement.

Egg hatching and production can be affected.

Diagnosis relies on the isolation of the [[virus]] from samples of internal organs or the faeces inoculated into embryonated chicken eggs.

The main [[necropsy]] findings are multiple necrotic lesions on the liver and sometimes the [[spleen]].

==Treatment and control==
There is no specific treatment for the condition.

Control may rely on boosting bird immunity, preventing group mixing and faecal spreading.
