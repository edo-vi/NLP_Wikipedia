Such phenomena are termed "hallucinations", in loose analogy with the phenomenon of [[hallucination|hallucination in human psychology]]. However, one key difference is that human hallucination is usually associated with false ''[[percept#Process and terminology|percept]]s'', but an AI hallucination is associated with the category of unjustified responses or beliefs.<ref name="axiv" /> Some researchers believe the specific term "AI hallucination" unreasonably anthropomorphizes computers.<ref name="ars making things up"/>

AI hallucination gained prominence around 2022 alongside the rollout of certain [[large language models]] (LLMs) such as [[ChatGPT]].<ref>{{cite arXiv |last1=Zhuo |first1=Terry Yue |last2=Huang |first2=Yujin |last3=Chen |first3=Chunyang |last4=Xing |first4=Zhenchang |title=Exploring AI Ethics of ChatGPT: A Diagnostic Analysis |year=2023 |class=cs.CL |eprint=2301.12867 }}</ref> Users complained that such bots often seemed to pointlessly embed plausible-sounding random falsehoods within their generated content.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Seife |first1=Charles |title=The Alarming Deceptions at the Heart of an Astounding New Chatbot |url=https://slate.com/technology/2022/12/davinci-003-chatbot-gpt-wrote-my-obituary.html |access-date=16 February 2023 |work=Slate |date=13 December 2022}}</ref> By 2023, analysts considered frequent hallucination to be a major problem in LLM technology, with some estimating chatbots hallucinate as much as 27% of the time.<ref name="cnbc several errors">{{cite news |last1=Leswing |first1=Kif |title=Microsoft's Bing A.I. made several factual errors in last week's launch demo |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/14/microsoft-bing-ai-made-several-errors-in-launch-demo-last-week-.html |access-date=16 February 2023 |work=CNBC |date=14 February 2023 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title= |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/06/technology/chatbots-hallucination-rates.html}}</ref>

==Analysis==
Various researchers cited by [[Wired (magazine)|''Wired'']] have classified adversarial hallucinations as a high-dimensional statistical phenomenon, or have attributed hallucinations to insufficient training data. Some researchers believe that some "incorrect" AI responses classified by humans as "hallucinations" in the case of [[object detection]] may in fact be justified by the training data, or even that an AI may be giving the "correct" answer that the human reviewers are failing to see. For example, an adversarial image that looks, to a human, like an ordinary image of a dog, may in fact be seen by the AI to contain tiny patterns that (in authentic images) would only appear when viewing a cat. The AI is detecting real-world visual patterns that humans are insensitive to.<ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Matsakis |first1=Louise |title=Artificial Intelligence May Not 'Hallucinate' After All |url=https://www.wired.com/story/adversarial-examples-ai-may-not-hallucinate/ |access-date=29 December 2022 |magazine=Wired |date=8 May 2019}}</ref> However, these findings have been challenged by other researchers.<ref name="bugs"/> For example, it was objected that the models can be biased towards superficial statistics, leading [[Adversarial machine learning|adversarial training]] to not be robust in real-world scenarios.<ref name="bugs">{{cite journal |title=A Discussion of 'Adversarial Examples Are Not Bugs, They Are Features': Adversarial Example Researchers Need to Expand What is Meant by 'Robustness' |last1=Gilmer |first1=Justin |last2=Hendrycks |first2=Dan |url=https://distill.pub/2019/advex-bugs-discussion/response-1/ |access-date=2023-01-24 | journal=[[Distill (journal)|Distill]] |doi=10.23915/distill.00019.1 |date=2019-08-06|volume=4 |issue=8 |s2cid=201142364 |doi-access=free }}</ref>

==In natural language processing==
In [[natural language processing]], a hallucination is often defined as "generated content that is nonsensical or unfaithful to the provided source content". Depending on whether the output contradicts the prompt or not they could be divided to closed-domain and open-domain respectively.<ref>{{cite arXiv | eprint=2303.08774 | author1=OpenAI | title=GPT-4 Technical Report | year=2023 | class=cs.CL }}</ref>

Hallucination was shown to be a statistically inevitable byproduct of any imperfect generative model that is trained to maximize training likelihood, such as [[GPT-3]], and requires [[active learning (machine learning)|active learning]] (such as [[Reinforcement learning from human feedback]]) to be avoided.<ref>{{Cite conference |url=http://proceedings.mlr.press/v75/hanneke18a.html |title=Actively Avoiding Nonsense in Generative Models |last1=Hanneke |first1=Steve |last2=Kalai |first2=Adam Tauman |last3=Kamath |first3=Gautam |last4=Tzamos |first4=Christos |date=2018 |publisher=Proceedings of Machine Learning Research (PMLR) |volume=75 |pages=209–227}}</ref> Errors in encoding and decoding between text and representations can cause hallucinations. AI training to produce diverse responses can also lead to hallucination. Hallucinations can also occur when the AI is trained on a dataset wherein labeled summaries, despite being factually accurate, are not directly grounded in the labeled data purportedly being "summarized". Larger datasets can create a problem of parametric knowledge (knowledge that is hard-wired in learned system parameters), creating hallucinations if the system is overconfident in its hardwired knowledge. In systems such as [[GPT-3]], an AI generates each next word based on a sequence of previous words (including the words it has itself previously generated during the same conversation), causing a cascade of possible hallucination as the response grows longer.<ref name="axiv" /> By 2022, papers such as the ''[[New York Times]]'' expressed concern that, as adoption of bots based on [[large language models]] continued to grow, unwarranted user confidence in bot output could lead to problems.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Metz |first1=Cade |title=The New Chatbots Could Change the World.

In August 2022, [[Meta Platforms|Meta]] warned during its release of BlenderBot 3 that the system was prone to "hallucinations", which Meta defined as "confident statements that are not true".<ref>{{cite news |last=Tung |first=Liam |title=Meta warns its new chatbot may forget that it's a bot |url=https://www.zdnet.com/article/meta-warns-its-new-chatbot-may-not-tell-you-the-truth/ |date=8 August 2022 |access-date=30 December 2022 |work=[[ZDNet]] |publisher=[[Red Ventures]] |language=en}}</ref> On 15 November 2022, Meta unveiled a demo of Galactica, designed to "store, combine and reason about scientific knowledge". Content generated by Galactica came with the warning "Outputs may be unreliable! Language Models are prone to hallucinate text." In one case, when asked to draft a paper on creating avatars, Galactica cited a fictitious paper from a real author who works in the relevant area. Meta withdrew Galactica on 17 November due to offensiveness and inaccuracy.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Edwards |first1=Benj |title=New Meta AI demo writes racist and inaccurate scientific literature, gets pulled |url=https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/11/after-controversy-meta-pulls-demo-of-ai-model-that-writes-scientific-papers/ |access-date=30 December 2022 |work=Ars Technica |date=18 November 2022 |language=en-us}}</ref><ref>{{Cite tweet |user=Michael_J_Black |author=Michael Black |author-link=Michael J.

There are several reasons for natural language models to hallucinate data.<ref name="axiv"/> For example:
* '''Hallucination from data''': There are divergences in the source content (which would often happen with large [[Training, validation, and test data sets|training data sets]]).
*'''Hallucination from training''': Hallucination still occurs when there is little divergence in the [[data set]]. In that case, it derives from the way the model is trained. A lot of reasons can contribute to this type of hallucination, such as: 
** An erroneous decoding from the [[Transformer (machine learning model)|transformer]]
** A bias from the historical sequences that the model previously generated
** A bias generated from the way the model encodes its knowledge in its parameters

===ChatGPT===
[[OpenAI]]'s [[ChatGPT]], released in beta-version to the public on November 30, 2022, is based on the [[foundation model]] GPT-3.5 (a revision of [[GPT-3]]). Professor Ethan Mollick of [[Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania|Wharton]] has called ChatGPT an "omniscient, eager-to-please intern who sometimes lies to you". Data scientist Teresa Kubacka has recounted deliberately making up the phrase "cycloidal inverted electromagnon" and testing ChatGPT by asking it about the (nonexistent) phenomenon. ChatGPT invented a plausible-sounding answer backed with plausible-looking citations that compelled her to double-check whether she had accidentally typed in the name of a real phenomenon. Other scholars such as [[Oren Etzioni]] have joined Kubacka in assessing that such software can often give you "a very impressive-sounding answer that's just dead wrong".<ref>{{cite news |last1=Bowman |first1=Emma |title=A new AI chatbot might do your homework for you.

Other examples involve baiting ChatGPT with a false premise to see if it embellishes upon the premise. When asked about "[[Harold Coward]]'s idea of dynamic canonicity", ChatGPT fabricated that Coward wrote a book titled ''Dynamic Canonicity: A Model for Biblical and Theological Interpretation,'' arguing that religious principles are actually in a constant state of change.

In May 2023, it was discovered Stephen Schwartz submitted six fake case precedents generated by ChatGPT in his [[brief (law)|brief]] to the [[Southern District of New York]] on ''Mata v.

On hallucinations, they make stuff up—even quotes and citations. Another issue is reliability or bias. While attorneys swear an oath to set aside their personal prejudices, biases, and beliefs to faithfully uphold the law and represent their clients, generative artificial intelligence is the product of programming devised by humans who did not have to swear such an oath. As such, these systems hold no allegiance to any client, the rule of law, or the laws and Constitution of the United States (or, as addressed above, the truth).

On June 23 [[P. Kevin Castel]] tossed the ''Mata'' case and issued a $5,000 fine to Schwartz and another lawyer for [[bad faith]] conduct, who continued to stand by the fictitious precedents despite his previous claims.

In June 2023, Mark Walters, a [[gun rights]] activist and radio personality, sued OpenAI in a [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] state court after ChatGPT mischaracterized a legal [[complaint]] in a manner alleged to be [[defamatory]] against Walters. The complaint in question was brought in May 2023 by the [[Second Amendment Foundation]] against Washington attorney general [[Robert W. Ferguson]] for allegedly violating their freedom of speech, whereas the ChatGPT-generated summary bore no resemblance and claimed that Walters was accused of [[embezzlement]] and [[fraud]] while holding a Second Amendment Foundation office post that he never held in real life. According to AI legal expert [[Eugene Volokh]], OpenAI may be shielded against this claim by [[Section 230]], unless the court finds that OpenAI "materially contributed" to the publication of defamatory content.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Belanger |first1=Ashley |title=OpenAI faces defamation suit after ChatGPT completely fabricated another lawsuit |url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/06/openai-sued-for-defamation-after-chatgpt-fabricated-yet-another-lawsuit/ |work=Ars Technica |date=9 June 2023 |language=en-us}}</ref>

=== Scientific research ===
AI models can cause problems in the world of academic and scientific research due to their hallucinations. Specifically, models like ChatGPT have been recorded in multiple cases to cite sources for information that are either not correct or do not exist. A study conducted in the [[Cureus|Cureus Journal of Medical Science]] showed that out of 178 total references cited by ChatGPT, 69 returned an incorrect or nonexistent [[Digital object identifier|DOI]]. An additional 28 had no known DOI nor could be located in a [[Google Search|Google search]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal |last=Athaluri |first=Sai Anirudh |last2=Manthena |first2=Sandeep Varma |last3=Kesapragada |first3=V S R Krishna Manoj |last4=Yarlagadda |first4=Vineel |last5=Dave |first5=Tirth |last6=Duddumpudi |first6=Rama Tulasi Siri |date=2023-04-11 |title=Exploring the Boundaries of Reality: Investigating the Phenomenon of Artificial Intelligence Hallucination in Scientific Writing Through ChatGPT References |url=https://www.cureus.com/articles/148687-exploring-the-boundaries-of-reality-investigating-the-phenomenon-of-artificial-intelligence-hallucination-in-scientific-writing-through-chatgpt-references |journal=Cureus |language=en |doi=10.7759/cureus.37432 |issn=2168-8184 |pmc=10173677 |pmid=37182055}}</ref>

Another instance of this occurring was documented by Jerome Goddard from [[Mississippi State University]]. In an experiment, ChatGPT had provided questionable information about [[Tick|ticks]]. Unsure about the validity of the response, they inquired about the source that the information had been gathered from. Upon looking at the source, it was apparent that not only had the DOI been hallucinated, but the names of the authors as well. Some of the authors were contacted and confirmed that they had no knowledge of the papers existence whatsoever.<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal |last=Goddard |first=Jerome |date=2023-06-25 |title=Hallucinations in ChatGPT: A Cautionary Tale for Biomedical Researchers |url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amjmed.2023.06.012 |journal=The American Journal of Medicine |volume=136 |issue=11 |pages=1059–1060 |doi=10.1016/j.amjmed.2023.06.012 |issn=0002-9343}}</ref> Goddard says that, "in [ChatGPT's] current state of development, physicians and biomedical researchers should NOT ask ChatGPT for sources, references, or citations on a particular topic. Or, if they do, all such references should be carefully vetted for accuracy."<ref name=":1" /> Goddard expresses that the use of these language models is not ready for fields of academic research and that their use should be handled carefully.

On top of providing incorrect or missing reference material, ChatGPT also has issues with hallucinating the contents of some reference material. A study that analyzed a total of 115 references provided by ChatGPT documented that 47% of them were fabricated. Another 46% cited real references but extracted incorrect information from them. Only the remaining 7% of references were cited correctly and provided accurate information. ChatGPT has also been observed to "double-down" on a lot of the incorrect information. When you ask ChatGPT about a mistake that may have been hallucinated, sometimes it will try to correct itself but other times it will claim the response is correct and provide even more [[Misinformation|misleading information.]]<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Bhattacharyya |first=Mehul |last2=Miller |first2=Valerie M. |last3=Bhattacharyya |first3=Debjani |last4=Miller |first4=Larry E. |last5=Bhattacharyya |first5=Mehul |last6=Miller |first6=Valerie |last7=Bhattacharyya |first7=Debjani |last8=Miller |first8=Larry E. |date=2023-05-19 |title=High Rates of Fabricated and Inaccurate References in ChatGPT-Generated Medical Content |url=https://www.cureus.com/articles/158289-high-rates-of-fabricated-and-inaccurate-references-in-chatgpt-generated-medical-content |journal=Cureus |language=en |volume=15 |issue=5 |doi=10.7759/cureus.39238 |issn=2168-8184 |pmc=10277170 |pmid=37337480}}</ref>

These hallucinated articles generated by [[Language model|language models]] also pose an issue because it is difficult to tell whether an article was generated by an AI. To show this, a group of researchers at the [[Northwestern University|Northwestern University of Chicago]] generated 50 [[Abstract (summary)|abstracts]] 
based on existing reports and analyzed their originality. Plagiarism detectors gave the generated articles an originality score of 100%, meaning that the information presented appears to be completely original.

Given the ability of AI generated language to pass as real scientific research in some cases, AI hallucinations present problems for the application of language models in the Academic and Scientific fields of research due to their ability to be undetectable when presented to real researchers. The high likelyhood of returning non-existent reference material and incorrect information may require limitations to be put in place regarding these language models. Some say that rather than hallucinations, these events are more akin to "fabrications" and "falsifications" and that the use of these language models presents a risk integrity of the field as a whole.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Emsley |first=Robin |date=2023-08-19 |title=ChatGPT: these are not hallucinations – they’re fabrications and falsifications |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41537-023-00379-4 |journal=Schizophrenia |language=en |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=1–2 |doi=10.1038/s41537-023-00379-4 |issn=2754-6993 |pmc=10439949 |pmid=37598184}}</ref>

== Terminologies ==
In ''[[Salon (magazine)|Salon]]'', statistician Gary N. Smith argues that LLMs "do not understand what words mean" and consequently that the term "hallucination" unreasonably anthropomorphizes the machine.<ref>{{cite news |title=An AI that can "write" is feeding delusions about how smart artificial intelligence really is |url=https://www.salon.com/2023/01/01/an-ai-that-can-write-is-feeding-delusions-about-how-smart-artificial-intelligence-really-is/ |access-date=11 June 2023 |work=Salon |date=2 January 2023 |language=en}}</ref> Journalist Benj Edwards, in ''[[Ars Technica]]'', writes that the term "hallucination" is controversial, but that some form of metaphor remains necessary; Edwards suggests "[[confabulation]]" as an analogy for processes that involve "creative gap-filling".<ref name="ars making things up" />

A list of use of the term "hallucination", definitions or characterizations in the context of LLMs include:

This left image is a simplified example of the training phase, using multiple images that are known to depict [[starfish]] and [[sea urchin]]s, respectively. The starfish match with a ringed texture and a star outline, whereas most sea urchins match with a striped texture and oval shape. However, the instance of a ring textured sea urchin creates a weakly weighted association between them.

However, the weakly weighted association between ringed texture and sea urchin also confers a weak signal to the latter from one of two intermediate nodes. In addition, a shell that was not included in the training gives a weak signal for the oval shape, also resulting in a weak signal for the sea urchin output. These weak signals may result in a false positive result for the presence of a sea urchin although there was none in the input image.<br>In reality, textures and outlines would not be represented by single nodes, but rather by associated weight patterns of multiple nodes.}}
The concept of "hallucination" is applied more broadly than just natural language processing. A confident response from any AI that seems unjustified by the training data can be labeled a hallucination.<ref name="axiv" /> ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' noted in 2018 that, despite no recorded attacks "in the wild" (that is, outside of [[proof-of-concept]] attacks by researchers), there was "little dispute" that consumer gadgets, and systems such as [[automated driving]], were susceptible to [[adversarial machine learning|adversarial attacks]] that could cause AI to hallucinate. Examples included a stop sign rendered invisible to computer vision; an audio clip engineered to sound innocuous to humans, but that software transcribed as "evil dot com"; and an image of two men on skis, that [[Google Cloud Platform#Cloud AI|Google Cloud Vision]] identified as 91% likely to be "a dog".<ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Simonite |first1=Tom |title=AI Has a Hallucination Problem That's Proving Tough to Fix |url=https://www.wired.com/story/ai-has-a-hallucination-problem-thats-proving-tough-to-fix/ |access-date=29 December 2022 |magazine=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |publisher=[[Condé Nast]] |date=2018-03-09}}</ref>

=== Mitigation methods ===
The hallucination phenomenon is still not completely understood.<ref name="axiv" /> Therefore, there is still ongoing research to try to mitigate its apparition.<ref>{{cite journal
