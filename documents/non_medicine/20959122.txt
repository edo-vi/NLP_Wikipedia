'''Popular history''', also called '''pop history''', is a broad [[genre]] of [[historiography]] that takes a popular approach, aims at a wide readership, and usually emphasizes [[narrative]], [[Personality type|personality]] and vivid detail over scholarly analysis. The term is used in contradistinction to professional academic or scholarly history writing which is usually more specialized and technical and thus less accessible to the general reader.

== Conceptualizations ==
It is proposed that popular history is a "moral science" in the sense that recreates the past not only for its own sake but also to underscore how history could facilitate an ethically responsible present.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=Popular History and the Literary Marketplace, 1840-1920|last=Pfitzer|first=Gregory M.|date=2008|publisher=University of Massachusetts Press|isbn=978-1-55849-625-5|location=Amherst and Boston|pages=40, 41}}</ref> Some view it as history produced by authors who are better interlocutors capable of translating the language of scientificity to ordinary everyday language.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Popular History Now and Then: International Perspectives|last1=Korte|first1=Barbara|last2=Paletschek|first2=Sylvia|date=2014-03-31|publisher=transcript Verlag|isbn=978-3-8376-2007-8|location=Bielefeld|pages=17}}</ref>

Some scholars partly attributed the development of popular history to the increase of writers-turned-historians such as [[Benson John Lossing|Benson Lossing]], David Pae, and [[Mary Howitt|Mary Botham Howitt]],{{Globalize-inline|date=February 2023}} who wrote historical events "in good style" and, thus, more appealing to the public.<ref name=":0" />

== Popular historians ==
Some popular historians are without academic affiliation while others are academics, or former academics, who have (according to one writer) "become somehow abstracted from the academic arena, becoming cultural commentators."<ref>De Groot, Jerome (2009), [https://books.google.com/books?id=hexpdOj8t80C&dq=%22popular+historian%22&pg=PA15 ''Consuming History: Historians and Heritage in Contemporary Popular Culture''], [[Routledge]], pg 15.</ref> Many worked as journalists, perhaps after taking an initial degree in history. Popular historians may become nationally renowned or best-selling authors and may or may not serve the interests of particular political viewpoints in their roles as "public historians". Many authors of "official histories" and "authorized biographies" would qualify as popular historians serving the interests of particular institutions or public figures.

Popular historians aim to appear on the "general lists" of general publishers, rather than the [[university press]]es that have dominated [[academic publishing]] in recent years. Increasingly, popular historians have taken to television where they are able, often accompanying a series of documentaries with a [[tie-in]] book.

==Examples==
=== Academics ===
Recent examples of American popular historians with academic affiliations include [[Daniel J. Boorstin]], [[Stephen E. Ambrose]], [[Doris Kearns Goodwin]] and [[Pauline Maier]]. 

Recent examples of British popular historians who are also academics include [[Niall Ferguson]], [[Mary Beard (classicist)|Mary Beard]], [[Christopher Hibbert]], [[Tom Holland (author)|Tom Holland]], [[Simon Sebag Montefiore]] and [[Simon Schama]], and – from a previous generation – [[Eric Hobsbawm]], [[Paul Johnson (writer)|Paul Johnson]], [[E. P. Thompson]], [[A. J. P. Taylor]] (a pioneer of history on television) and [[Christopher Hill (historian)|Christopher Hill]]. Much of [[Hugh Trevor-Roper]]'s output was also directed at a popular audience. There is also [[Stella Tillyard]] and her work ''Aristocrats'', which combined scholarly research with the popular method of presentation.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Narratology in the Age of Cross-Disciplinary Narrative Research|last1=Heinen|first1=Sandra|last2=Sommer|first2=Roy|date=2009-09-04|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=978-3-11-022242-5|location=Berlin|pages=228}}</ref>

Canadian academics whose work has crossed over to public consciousness are few.  Examples might include [[Michael Bliss]], [[Donald Creighton]], [[Desmond Morton (historian)|Desmond Morton]], [[J. L. Granatstein]], or [[Margaret MacMillan]].  In French Canada the influence of Father [[Lionel Groulx]] in the historical thought of the twentieth century was preponderant.

=== Non academics ===
American non-academics include [[Walter Lord]], [[Bruce Catton]], [[Shelby Foote]], [[David McCullough]], [[Max Cutler]], [[Ron Cutler (radio broadcaster)|Ron Cutler]], and [[Barbara W. Tuchman]]. Podcasting has become a new medium for the dissemination of popular history, in which the contributions of Americans [[Dan Carlin]] and [[Robert Evans (journalist)|Robert Evans]] are notable.

[[John Julius Norwich]], [[Charles Allen (writer)|Charles Allen]], and [[Tariq Ali]] are popular British historians who have never been academics.

English-Canadian writers of popular histories include journalists [[Pierre Berton]] and [[Peter C. Newman]], humourist [[Will Ferguson]], folklorist and pulp fiction writer [[Thomas P. Kelley]], and television presenter [[Patrick Watson (producer)|Patrick Watson]].  [[François-Xavier Garneau]] was the leading historian in nineteenth century French Canada from outside the academy.  Polemicists in the [[National question (Quebec)|national unity debate]] have also written influentially about Canadian history, notably militant [[Pierre Vallières]] and journalist [[Normand Lester]] critiquing the Canadian state and novelist [[Mordecai Richler]] critiquing Quebec nationalist historians as anti-Semitic.  Notably, Canada has produced several writers who have written popular histories of specific ethnic communities, including [[Ken McGoogan]] (Scots and Irish), [[Myrna Kostash]] (Ukrainians), etc.
