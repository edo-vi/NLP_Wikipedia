'''Kenneth John Harvey''' [[Order of Australia|AM]] is an Australian [[public health]] doctor, currently Honorary Adjunct Associate Professor at the Institute for Evidence-Based Healthcare in [[Bond University]]. Described by ''[[The Age]]'' as an "anti-[[quackery]] crusader", Harvey is an advocate of [[evidence-based medicine]] and a critic of [[pharmaceutical marketing]] and unproven diet products.<ref name="theage2014"/> He is the president of [[Friends of Science in Medicine]].
In 2017, Harvey was awarded a Member of the [[Order of Australia]] (AM) for his "significant service to community health and the pharmaceutical industry”.

==Career==
Harvey graduated in medicine from the [[University of Melbourne]]. He developed an interest in the factors that influence the prescribing of [[antibiotic]]s, especially where it involved unethical promotion.<ref name=MJA_205_5/> He worked at the [[Royal Melbourne Hospital]] and then as an adjunct associate professor in the School of Public Health at [[La Trobe University]].<ref name=conversation />

Harvey took part in drawing up ethical criteria for the promotion of [[medicinal drug]]s for the [[World Health Organization]], and served on a committee that formulated the Australian "Quality Use of Medicines" policy. He has also worked on medicinal drug policy in Southeast Asia, Croatia, and Jordan. He is Chair of the Governing Council of [[Health Action International]] Asia Pacific.<ref name=LaTrobe_2012/>
He served on the [[Therapeutic Goods Administration|TGA]]'s Transparency Review Panel, the Medicines Australia Code Review Panel, the Working Group on Promotion of Therapeutic Products,  and the Natural Therapy Review Advisory Committee.<ref name=Skeptics_2016/>
Another of his areas of interest is the application of information technology to optimise medicinal drug use.<ref name=conversation />

Harvey quit his job with La Trobe in 2014 after the university agreed to receive $15 million from [[Swisse]] Wellness to fund a new complementary medicine centre.<ref name="theage2014">{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/academic-quits-over-swisse-deal-with-uni-20140204-31zhl.html|title=Academic quits over Swisse deal with uni|date=5 Feb 2014|work=The Age}}</ref><ref name="Guardian2015"/> He told the ''Australian Journal of Pharmacy'' that "in 2013–4 Swisse sought a research partnership with a number of Australian universities; all but one resisted on the grounds that, while such an association might give Swisse a fig-leaf of respectability, it would not reflect well on the reputation of the university involved."<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Paola|first1=Sheshtyn|title=ABC announces partnership with Swisse Wellness|journal=Australian Journal of Pharmacy|date=23 August 2016|url=https://ajp.com.au/news/abc-announces-partnership-swisse-wellness/|accessdate=29 November 2016}}</ref>  This followed legal action by Swisse against the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] for defamation in a consumer advocacy show ''[[The Checkout]]'', which criticised their research methods.<ref>{{cite news|last=Butler|first=Ben|title=ABC show defamed me, Swisse patriarch claims|url=http://www.theage.com.au/business/abc-show-defamed-me-swisse-patriarch-claims-20130502-2ivvo.html|accessdate=31 May 2014|newspaper=[[The Age]]|date=2 May 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Ross|first=Annabel|title=ABC keeps Swisse segment online despite legal action|url=http://www.theage.com.au/entertainment/tv-and-radio/abc-keeps-swisse-segment-online-despite-legal-action-20130503-2ixhk.html|accessdate=31 May 2014|newspaper=The Age|date=3 May 2013}}</ref>

In 2014 after leaving La Trobe, Harvey took a post as Adjunct Associate Professor of Epidemiology & Preventive Medicine at [[Monash University]].<ref>{{cite web|title=DEPM Staff – Adjunct Associate Professor Ken Harvey|url=http://www.med.monash.edu.au/epidemiology/staff/adjunct/harvey.html|website=www.med.monash.edu.au|publisher=Monash University Department of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences|accessdate=29 November 2016}}</ref><ref name=conversation>{{cite web|url=https://theconversation.com/profiles/ken-harvey-218|title=Ken Harvey|work=The Conversation}}</ref>  Then in February 2021 he accepted an appointment as Honorary Adjunct Associate Professor in the Institute for Evidence-Based Healthcare at Bond University.<ref name="Bond profile">{{cite web |title=Kenneth Harvey |url=https://research.bond.edu.au/en/persons/kenneth-harvey |website=Bond University Research Staff |access-date=9 December 2021 |language=en}}</ref>

He also set up a private advocacy and consultancy company, "Medreach".

==Campaigning==
Harvey is a critic of drug promotion by pharmaceutical companies,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mja.com.au/insight/2015/7/ken-harvey-code-breaches|title=Code breaches|work=Medical Journal of Australia|date=2 Mar 2015}}</ref> and supports a campaign called "No Advertising Please" that calls on doctors to reject free lunches from drug company representatives (who selectively present evidence that goes in a new drug's favour), and instead to only prescribe drugs that they have independently researched, including reading critical evaluations. Harvey served as a consumer representative on Medicines Australia's transparency working group, which advocated for patients to be able to know whether their doctors had been given free flights to industry-funded conferences that promote new drugs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/transparency-on-drug-company-payments-and-trips-for-doctors-a-step-closer-20150427-1muf6l.html|title=Transparency on drug company payments and trips for doctors a step closer|date=27 Apr 2015|author=Dan Harrison|work=Sydney Morning Herald}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/pharmalot/2015/04/29/what-meals-pharma-will-not-disclose-all-payments-to-docs-down-under/|title=What Meals?

===Therapeutic Goods Administration===
Harvey has called on the Australian [[Therapeutic Goods Administration]] (TGA) "to ban inaccurate, misleading or unethical promotion of medicines", and is a strong critic of the way that therapeutic claims of complementary medicines are regulated.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tga.gov.au/sites/default/files/consult-advertising-arrangements-101028-submission-harvey.pdf|title=Position Paper and Consultation on the Promotion and Advertising Arrangements of Therapeutic Goods in Australia: A Response |author=Ken Harvey|date=2 July 2010|work=Submission to Therapeutic Goods Administration}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mja.com.au/insight/2013/26/ken-harvey-advertising-battleground|title=Ken Harvey: Advertising battleground|work=Medical Journal of Australia|date=25 July 2013|author=Ken Harvey}}</ref> Harvey has criticised the TGA for not regulating body building products that contain synthetic [[amphetamines]], which are instead regulated as food products despite making [[health claims]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/health-supplement-acacia-rigidula-may-contain-synthetic-amphetamines-20150415-1mli4q.html|title=Health supplement Acacia rigidula may contain synthetic amphetamines|date=15 Apr 2015|work=The Sydney Morning Herald}}</ref>  In 2016, he highlighted that Chemmart's consumer DNA testing was misleading and breached the TGA's Advertising Code because it was not able to deliver on the claims being made for it.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Haggan|first1=Megan|title=Ken Harvey slams Chemmart's myDNA test|journal=Australian Journal of Pharmacy|date=17 February 2016|url=https://ajp.com.au/news/ken-harvey-slams-chemmarts-mydna-test/|accessdate=29 November 2016}}</ref> Harvey had been appointed in 2018 by the federal [[Health Minister]], [[Greg Hunt]] to represent the consumer organisation and magazine [[Choice (Australian magazine)|CHOICE]] on the advertising consultative committee of TGA, but in 2020, he resigned his position, citing a sense of frustration with the way the TGA upheld complaints against the promotion and sale of [[complementary medicines]]. He claimed that in 2018–19, the TGA did not issue sufficient penalties, in spite of having the power to do so. The TGA rejected this claim, noting the large number of fines handed out over dishonest advertisements during [[COVID-19]], however, the Consumers Health Forum and CHOICE took Harvey's concerns very seriously.{{R|Resignation}}

===Friends of Science in Medicine===

In 2019, Harvey became the president of ''[[Friends of Science in Medicine]]'' (FSM). He replaced Professor [[John Dwyer (medicine)|John Dwyer AO]], the founding president.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.scienceinmedicine.org.au/2019/02/06/fsm-welcomes-new-president/|title=FSM welcomes new President|date=2019-02-05|website=Friends of Science in Medicine|language=en-AU|access-date=2019-02-07}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ajp.com.au/news/pharmacy-announcements/new-head-for-health-watchdog/|title=New head for health watchdog|last=Paola|first=Sheshtyn|date=2019-02-05|website=AJP (Australian Journal of Pharmacy)|language=en-AU|access-date=2019-02-07}}</ref>

FSM, founded in 2011, is an organization which aims "to emphasise the importance of having health care in Australia based upon evidence, scientifically sound research and established scientific knowledge."<ref>{{cite web |publisher=Friends of Science in Medicine |title=Welcome from the President of Friends of Science in Medicine |url=http://www.scienceinmedicine.org.au |accessdate=11 September 2015}}</ref>  It has grown to become a major critic of unscientific health practices and fraudulent health claims. It has advised governments and media, made numerous submissions to enquiries and provided extensive public advice concerning dubious health claims and practices. It successfully advocated the removal of private health insurance taxpayer-funded rebates from ‘natural’ therapies that lacked evidence of efficacy. FSM campaigns against the unethical promotion of therapeutic goods and services to consumers.  Harvey originally joined the organization in 2016 and is a long-time executive member of FSM<ref name=MJA_205_5/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.australiandoctor.com.au/news/australias-best-known-anti-quackery-campaigner-joins-friends-science-medicine|title=Australia's best known anti-quackery campaigner joins Friends of Science in Medicine {{!}} Australian Doctor|last=Akiki|first=Leanne|date=12 January 2016|website=www.australiandoctor.com.au|access-date=2019-02-07}}</ref>

===Nurofen===
Harvey criticised the [[Reckitt|Reckitt Benckiser]] brand [[Nurofen]] for marketing identical [[ibuprofen]] products in different packages as "targeting" specific pain, which became the subject of an [[Australian Competition & Consumer Commission]] (ACCC) investigation.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.accc.gov.au/media-release/accc-targets-alleged-false-and-misleading-nurofen-claims|title=ACCC targets alleged false and misleading Nurofen claims|date=5 March 2015|publisher=[[Australian Competition & Consumer Commission]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://theconversation.com/tga-failure-gives-nurofen-consumers-a-headache-8762|title=TGA failure gives Nurofen consumers a headache|author=Ken Harvey|date=10 Aug 2012|work=The Conversation}}</ref>

===SensaSlim===
Harvey was sued for alleged defamation by SensaSlim, a company that marketed products claimed to offer weight loss benefits, after he lodged a complaint about their practices with the [[Therapeutic Goods Administration]].<ref name=LaTrobe_2012/>  The company attempted to delete all correspondence with an Internet marketing company while under investigation by the ACCC.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/business/accc-granted-injunction-against-director-of-weight-loss-company-20110817-1iyai.html|title=ACCC granted injunction against director of weight loss company|work=Sydney Morning Herald|date=18 Aug 2011}}</ref>

The Federal Court determined that the company had engaged in deceptive conduct.  The final result was that the company was fined a total of $3.55&nbsp;million and was de-listed. Its principal,
[[Peter Foster]], was fined $660,000 and permanently banned from being a company director or having any business in the diet or health industry.  Two other directors, Peter O'Brien and Michael Boyle were fined $55,000 and $75,000 respectively and disqualified from being company directors.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Hall|first1=Louise|title=Conman Peter Foster fined and banned over weight loss scam SensaSlim|url=http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/conman-peter-foster-fined-and-banned-over-weight-loss-scam-sensaslim-20160511-gossyp.html|accessdate=22 November 2016|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=11 May 2016}}</ref>

===''Medical Journal of Australia''===
In 2015, [[Stephen Leeder]] was sacked as the [[editor-in-chief]] of the ''[[Medical Journal of Australia]]'' after criticizing the decision to outsource production of the journal to the global publishing giant [[Elsevier]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-05-01/academic-outrage-as-leading-health-journal-editor-sacked/6435850|title=Backlash over decision by Australia's top medical journal to outsource to company with history of 'unethical' behaviour|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|date=1 May 2015}}</ref> All but one of the AMJ's editorial advisory committee resigned following the decision to sack Leeder, and wrote to AMA president [[Brian Owler]] asking him to review the decision.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/medical-journal-editor-sacked-and-editorial-committee-resigns-20150503-1myr8q.html|title=Medical journal editor sacked and editorial committee resigns|date=4 May 2015|work=Sydney Morning Herald}}</ref> Ken Harvey supported Leeder and said that his sacking, and the use of Elsevier is "a mistake that is fairly irredeemable"<ref name="Guardian2015">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/may/04/medical-journal-of-australia-will-be-shunned-by-researchers-after-editor-sacked-academic-says|title=Medical Journal of Australia will be shunned by researchers after editor sacked, academic says|date=4 May 2015|work=The Guardian}}</ref>

===Chiropractic===
Harvey is very critical of the way that complaints against chiropractors have been handled by the [[Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency]]'s (AHPRA) Chiropractic Board of Australia, regarding violations of its registration standards since the board's inception. The violations include "advertising in a misleading or deceptive manner," use of testimonials, and encouragement of "unnecessary use of health services." After a lack of resolution to these complaints, Harvey and the FSM approached the ACCC since they have "powers, under national consumer law, to prosecute for misleading and deceptive and unconscionable conduct" in the hopes that action would be taken to resolve the complaints.<ref name=TSZ380>{{cite web|author=Maynard|title=The Skeptic Zone #380 – 31.Jan.2016|url=http://skepticzone.libsyn.com/the-skeptic-zone-380-31jan2016|website=The Skeptic Zone|accessdate=5 January 2017|date=31 January 2016|authorlink=Maynard (broadcaster)}}</ref>

In 2015, over a year after contacting the ACCC, Harvey and the FSM followed up on "ten representative complaints" to see if any action had been taken by either government body. Of those complaints, only one clinic resolved all of the issues while the others were still unresolved, including one clinic which had simply set up a new website containing the previous violations. It appeared that AHPRA had contacted the chiropractic clinics regarding the complaints, but they had not done very much to enforce their own rules. In response to this failure, Harvey and his colleagues contacted the press, including the AMJ and [[The Sydney Morning Herald]],<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/comment/ken-harvey-20160116-gm7hln.html |title=Chiropractor watchdog must show some bite |date=18 January 2016 |author=Harvey, Ken |work=Sydney Morning Herald |accessdate=20 January 2017}}</ref> bringing a large amount of attention to the issue.<ref name=TSZ380 />

==Recognition==
In 2011 he was awarded the [[Australian Skeptics#Thornett|Thornett Award]] for Promotion of Reason by the [[Australian Skeptics]], and in 2013 they made him a life member.<ref name=Skeptics_2016>{{cite web|last1=Mendham|first1=Tim|title=ANZAAS medal for Ken Harvey|url=http://www.skeptics.com.au/2016/08/09/anzaas-medal-for-ken-harvey/|publisher=Australian Skeptics Inc|accessdate=22 November 2016|date=9 August 2016}}</ref>

The Australian consumer advocacy organisation [[Choice (Australian consumer organisation)|Choice]] gave Harvey its "Consumer Champion" award in 2012, describing him as a "scam buster and snake oil nemesis",<ref>{{cite press release|title=CHOICE Awards shine spotlight on the best|url=http://energycut.com.au/business/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/CHOICE-Awards-Transport.pdf|accessdate=22 November 2016|date=2012}}</ref> and they made Harvey a life member for his "services to the consumer movement".<ref name=conversation /><ref name=LaTrobe_2012>{{cite web|title=Ken Harvey: Consumer Champion|url=https://latrobeuniversitybulletin.com/2012/05/23/ken-harvey-consumer-champion/|website=La Trobe University Bulletin|accessdate=22 November 2016|date=23 May 2012}}</ref>
