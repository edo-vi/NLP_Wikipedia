'''Zamia staggers''' is a fatal nervous disease affecting cattle in areas where they browse on the leaves or fruit of [[cycad]]s—in particular, those of the genus [[Zamia]] (thus the name).  It is characterised by irreversible paralysis of the hind legs because of the degeneration of the [[spinal cord]].  It is caused by the [[toxin]]s [[cycasin]] and [[macrozamin]], β-glycosides (the sugars of which are glucose and primeverose, respectively) of [[methylazoxymethanol acetate|methylazoxymethanol]] (MAM), and which are found in all cycad genera.

Following ingestion the sugar is removed by bacterial [[glycosidase]] in the gut, with the MAM being absorbed.  The metabolized toxin produces tumours of the liver, kidney, intestine and brain after a latent period which may be a year or longer.  The disease has been known in Australia since the 1860s and was the subject of a [[Government of Queensland|Queensland Government]] investigation during the 1890s.<ref>{{cite book |chapter= The botany of the first Australians|title="People and Plants in Australia"|editor-last1=Carr|editor-first1=D.J.|editor-last2=Carr|editor-first2=S.G.M.|year= 1981 |publisher= Academic Press |location= Sydney |isbn= 0-12-160720-8 |page=18}}</ref>
