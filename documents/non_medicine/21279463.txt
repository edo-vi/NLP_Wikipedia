{{nihongo|'''''Purple Eyes in the Dark'''''|闇のパープル·アイ|Yami no Pāpuru Ai|lead=yes}} is a Japanese [[Shōjo manga|''shōjo'' manga]] series written and illustrated by [[Chie Shinohara]]. It was serialized in ''[[Shōjo Comic]]'' magazine from 1984 to 1986. The individual chapters were collected in 12 ''[[tankōbon]]'' volumes published by [[Shogakukan]] between October 1984 and February 1987. The story follows the struggles of a teenage girl after she finds herself turning into a [[lycanthropy]]-[[leopard]] and having to battle her newly found predatory instincts.

The series was adapted into 30-minute music video ([[original video animation]]) in 1987 and a series of six [[light novel]]s from 1991 to 1992. It was also adapted into an 11-episode [[live-action]] [[Japanese television drama]] that was broadcast on [[TV Asahi]] in Japan in 1996.

''Purple Eyes in the Dark'' was awarded the 1987 [[Shogakukan Manga Award]] in the ''shōjo'' manga category.

==Story==
Rinko Ozaki is a normal high school girl, but she has a fixation on a weird birthmark on her arm. Her biology teacher, Ms. Sonehara, has a peculiar interest in the birthmark, and it fires up when her childhood friend, Shin'ya Mizushima, tries to make a move on her. Not only that, Rinko also notices her eyes glow purple. The next day when Rinko is sexually assaulted, she finally discovers that her birthmark causes her to turn into a leopard.

==Characters==
;Rinko Ozaki
:A first year in high-school, she has a crush on her childhood friend Shin'ya Mizushima. When assaulted by some of her classmates, Rinko involuntarily transforms into a leopard and kills them.
;Shin'ya Mizushima
:A third year high-school student, Shin'ya has known Rinko since they were very young. He first shelters Rinko after finding her unconscious after the deaths of their classmates.
;Kaoruko Sonehara
:Rinko's biology teacher. She and her father studied humans who could turn into beasts. She first suspects Rinko of being one of these humans after she sees her birthmark. She is a cruel woman who tries to conduct experiments on Rinko and even her sister Maiko, assuming that she can transform too because they have the same blood.
;Maiko Ozaki
:Rinko's sister. She later dies when Sonehara experiments on her, thinking she too can transform.
;Professor Sonehara
:Kaoruko's father, he also studied people who can transform into beasts. When he presents his evidence to the world of science, he is shamed and rejected, and in a state of madness sets himself on fire. Kaoruko douses the flames and he survives, but has succumbed to insanity. Kaoruko locks him in the basement of their villa home so that the world can presume he is dead instead of tainting his image and research with his insanity.
;Mitusgu Odagiri
:A journalist who originally tries to expose Sonehara's research on humans that can turn into beasts, but he later pursues Rinko, and reveals that he has purple eyes too. He can transform into a black panther that is larger than Rinko.
