Protests during the playing of the [[United States national anthem]] have had many causes, including civil rights, anti-conscription, anti-war, [[anti-nationalism]], and religious reservations. Such protests have occurred since at least the 1890s, well before "[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]" was adopted and resolved by Congress as the official national anthem in 1916 and 1931, respectively. Earlier protests typically took place during the performance of various unofficial national anthems, including "[[My Country, 'Tis of Thee]]" and "[[Hail, Columbia]]". These demonstrations may include refusal to stand or face the American flag during the playing of the Anthem. Some of the protestors object to honoring the slaveowner and author of the lyrics, [[Francis Scott Key]].

==On political grounds==
===Early examples===
In 1892, three men, including a friend of [[Ida B. Wells]], were [[lynching|lynched]] by a white mob while in police custody in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], in an event known as the [[Peoples Grocery|People's Grocery lynching]]. This act sparked a national outcry. At a meeting of one thousand people at Bethel A. M. E. Church, Reverend W. Gaines called for the crowd to sing the then ''de facto'' national anthem, "[[My Country, 'Tis of Thee]]," but the call was refused, one member of the audience declaring, "I don't want to sing that song until this country is what it claims to be, 'sweet land of liberty'".<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/6657652/not_their_country_the_decatur_herald/|title=Not Their Country, The Decatur Herald (Decatur, Illinois) March 29, 1892, page 1|date=1892-03-29|work=The Decatur Herald|access-date=2019-11-12|pages=1}}</ref><ref name=":1">{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/6654115/wouldnt_sing_america_the_evening/|title=Wouldn't Sing America," The Evening World (New York, New York) March 28, 1892, page 3|date=1892-03-28|work=The Evening World|access-date=2019-11-12|pages=3}}</ref> The Reverend substituted the Civil War-era song about the abolitionist martyr, "[[John Brown's Body]]".

===Early 20th century===
[[File:Goldman.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Emma Goldman]] was imprisoned for two years after opposing conscription in the US during World War I.]]
Refusal to stand during the national anthem became a widespread form of [[United States in World War I|protest during World War I]]. In some cases, this was related to protest of [[conscription]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7116016/the_st_louis_star_and_times/|title=Clipped From The St. Louis Star and Times|date=1917-06-01|work=The St. Louis Star and Times|access-date=2019-11-12|pages=3}}</ref> Newspapers at the time associated the protests with support for [[socialism]],<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7116078/asked_to_resign_the_los_angeles_times/|title=Asked to Resign, The Los Angeles Times (Los Angeles, California) October 30, 1917, page 13|date=1917-10-30|work=The Los Angeles Times|access-date=2019-11-12|pages=13}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7116139/the_oregon_daily_journal/|title=Clipped From The Oregon Daily Journal|date=1918-06-18|work=The Oregon Daily Journal|access-date=2019-11-12|pages=4}}</ref> [[Bolshevism]],<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7116158/harrisburg_telegraph/|title=Clipped From Harrisburg Telegraph|date=1918-12-09|work=Harrisburg Telegraph|access-date=2019-11-12|pages=16}}</ref> or [[communism]].

Protests during the anthem continued after World War I. For example, during the build-up [[United States home front during World War II|towards World War II]], a group of students at [[Haverford College]] in [[Philadelphia]] refused to stand because they felt the custom was leading to "rabid nationalism".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7116195/wilkesbarre_times_leader_the_evening/|title=Clipped From Wilkes-Barre Times Leader, The Evening News|date=1934-05-31|work=Wilkes-Barre Times Leader, The Evening News|access-date=2019-11-12|pages=21}}</ref> In 1943 in [[Arizona]], a federal judge ruled that members of [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] cannot be suspended from school for refusing to stand during the national anthem.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7116227/the_san_bernardino_county_sun/|title=Clipped From The San Bernardino County Sun|date=1963-08-30|work=The San Bernardino County Sun|access-date=2019-11-12|pages=11}}</ref>

===1960s and 1970s===

[[File:Jane Fonda 1975d.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jane Fonda]] at an anti-Vietnam War conference in The Hague in January 1975]]
In the 1960s, refusal to stand during the anthem took place for a number of reasons. In the late 1960s, the protest became increasingly common among athletes and at schools, both as an [[opposition to the Vietnam War]] and as a protest of nationalism. Some of the cases involving students included the following. In December 1968, Chris Wood, co-captain of the [[Adelbert College]] basketball team was removed from the team for not standing, saying, "We believe in the fellowship of man. We don't believe in nationalism."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7116260/el_paso_heraldpost/|title=Clipped From El Paso Herald-Post|date=1968-12-11|work=El Paso Herald-Post|access-date=2019-11-12|pages=24}}</ref> Five white high school students were suspended in [[Cumberland, Maryland]] in February 1970.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7116277/the_daily_courier/|title=Clipped From The Daily Courier|date=1970-02-25|work=The Daily Courier|access-date=2019-11-12|pages=19}}</ref> A federal judge [[Joseph P.

From 1968 onwards, [[Jimi Hendrix]] performed an instrumental version using feedback, distortion and other effects to deconstruct the music with the sonic images of rockets and bombs. Common interpretations link this to an [[opposition to the Vietnam War]], as opposed to Hendrix's own explanation: "We're all Americans&nbsp;... it was like 'Go America!' ...&nbsp;We play it the way the air is in America today. The air is slightly static, see".{{sfn|Cross|2005|p=271}}

[[Donald Sutherland]], [[Gary Goodrow]], [[Peter Boyle]], and [[Jane Fonda]] developed an anti-war comedy show which featured a skit about people refusing to stand during the anthem which toured about 20 cities in 1971.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7116407/antiwar_show_has_sro_crowd_the_troy/|title=Anti-War Show has SRO Crowd, The Troy Record (Troy, New York) March 15, 1927, page 1|date=1971-03-15|work=The Troy Record|access-date=2019-11-12|pages=1}}</ref>

====Civil rights activities====
At the same time, Civil Rights became an important cause which led to anthem protests. The [[1968 Olympics Black Power salute]] was a political demonstration conducted by [[African-American]] athletes [[Tommie Smith]] and [[John Carlos]] during their medal ceremony at the [[1968 Summer Olympics]] in the [[Estadio Ol√≠mpico Universitario|Olympic Stadium]] in [[Mexico City]]. After having won gold and bronze medals, respectively, in the [[200 metres at the Olympics|200 meter]] running event, they turned on the podium to face their flags, and to hear the American national anthem, "[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]". Each athlete [[Raised fist|raised a black-gloved fist]], and kept them raised until the anthem had finished. In addition, Smith, Carlos, and Australian silver medalist [[Peter Norman]] all wore human rights badges on their jackets. In his autobiography, ''Silent Gesture'', Smith stated that the gesture was not a "[[Black Power]]" salute, but a "human rights salute". The event is regarded as one of the most overtly political statements in the history of the modern [[Olympic Games]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2094-2393575,00.html |work=The Sunday Times |location=London |last=Lewis |first=Richard |date=8 October 2006 |title=Caught in Time: Black Power salute, Mexico, 1968 |access-date=9 November 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/retropolis/wp/2017/09/24/they-didnt-takeaknee-the-black-power-protest-salute-that-shook-the-world-in-1968/|title=They didn't #TakeTheKnee: The Black Power protest salute that shook the world in 1968|first=DeNeen L.|last= Brown |newspaper=Washington Post|language=en|date=2017-09-24|access-date=2019-11-12}}</ref>

In 1969, [[University of Wyoming]] coach [[Lloyd Eaton]] dismissed 14 black football players who requested to wear black armbands to protest the racial slurs they faced during games, particularly against [[BYU]]. When the two teams played in 1971, about 50 students at UW refused to stand during the national anthem and wore black armbands during the game.<ref>Wyoming President Says Black 14 Issues Remain, The Daily Herald (Provo, Utah) October 21, 1971, page 19, accessed October 21, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7116500//</ref> Another place where African Americans refused to stand during the anthem in 1971 was at [[Northern Illinois University]] basketball games, which led to widespread criticism.<ref>Banning Anthem Discraceful Action, Belvidere Daily Republican (Belvidere, Illinois) December 20, 1971, page 6, accessed October 21, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7116534//</ref>

The protests became widespread, and in some cases, arrangements were made for the anthem to be played before athletes left the locker room. Lew Alcindor, later known as [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]], began to refuse to stand at [[UCLA]] basketball games, and in response the anthem was played before the players left the locker room in the UCLA-[[University of Washington]] game.<ref>Walt Brown, Athletes, Celebrities Personal Moments: The 60s and 70s, AuthorHouse, Mar 10, 2016</ref> UCLA's coach John Wooden denied that Alcindor or any other UCLA player he coached had refused to stand for the anthem, while sometimes the anthem was played while the team was in the locker room or even during warm ups.<ref>Hy Gardner, "Glad You Asked That," The Indiannapolis Star, Dec. 06, 1969, 86 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/62382199/alcindor-at-ucla-stand-for-anthem/</ref> The same was done when the five starters of [[Florida State University]]'s basketball team, all African American, played [[Tulane University]] in 1971 in [[New Orleans]].<ref>FSU Starters Refuse to Stand for Anthem, Albuquerque Journal (Albuquerque, New Mexico) January 14, 1971, page 25, accessed October 21, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7116445//</ref>

At the [[1972 Summer Olympics]], two American 400&nbsp;m runners, [[Vincent Matthews (athlete)|Vincent Matthews]] (gold medalist) and [[Wayne Collett]] (silver medalist), staged a protest on the victory podium, talking to each other and failing to stand at attention during the medal ceremony.<ref name="google.com">{{cite book | last1=Schiller | first1=K. | last2=Young | first2=C. | title=The 1972 Munich Olympics and the Making of Modern Germany | publisher=University of California Press | series=Weimar and now | year=2010 | isbn=978-0-520-26213-3 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yxEQEqnXdRAC&pg=PT134 | access-date=2015-04-17}}</ref> They were banned by the IOC, as [[Tommie Smith]] and [[John Carlos]] had been in the [[1968 Summer Olympics]].

Civil rights based protests continued into the late 1970s. In 1978, a student was barred from receiving his diploma in [[Dayton, Ohio]] for refusing to sing.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7116628/wont_sing_anthem_so_no_diploma_the/|title=Won't Sing Anthem, so no Diploma, The Pantagraph (Bloomington, Illinois) June 4, 1978, page 10|date=1978-06-04|work=The Pantagraph|access-date=2019-11-12|pages=10}}</ref>

===Turn of the millennium===
On August 24, 1990, Irish pop singer [[Sin√©ad O'Connor]] threatened to boycott her scheduled performance that night at the [[Garden State Arts Center]] in [[Holmdel Township, New Jersey]], if the U.S. national anthem were played. In her own words, she explained,

{{quote|I sincerely harbor no disrespect for America or Americans, but I have a policy of not having any national anthems played before my concerts in any country, including [[Amhr√°n na bhFiann|my own]], because they have nothing to do with music in general ... I am concerned though, because today, we're seeing other artists arrested at their own concerts ... There is a disturbing trend towards censorship of music and art in this country and people should be alarmed over that far more than my actions ...}}

The Center gave in to her demands, but not without controversy. [[Frank Sinatra]] criticized her the following evening while performing at the same venue, stating that he wished that he could "kick her in the ass." [[New York state]] Senator Nicholas Spano urged people to boycott O'Connor's subsequent show in [[Saratoga Springs, New York|Saratoga]], saying "I'm sure Ms. O'Connor would be the first to complain if someone tried to censor her performance, yet she is trying to censor the national anthem by refusing to perform where it is played."<ref>{{cite news|title=Legislator Urges Boycott Over Sinead's Anthem Ban|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-08-28/entertainment/ca-409_1_national-anthem|access-date=September 28, 2017|work=Los Angeles Times|agency=Times Wire Services|page=10}}</ref>

In the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] in 1996, [[Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf]], guard for the [[Denver Nuggets]], refused to stand during the anthem before games in protest of [[Criticism of Islam|anti-Islamic]] rhetoric.

In 2003, two women's basketball players, Toni Smith of [[Manhattanville College]] and Deidra Chatman of the [[Virginia Cavaliers women's basketball|University of Virginia]], made headlines for refusing to face the flag during the national anthem. Chatman protested for one game in March 2003 due to her anti-war views in light of the then-ongoing tensions between the U.S. and [[Iraq]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Reedy|first1=Jim|title=U-Va.

[[File:Colin Kaepernick in 2013.jpg|thumb|[[Colin Kaepernick]] in 2013]]
During 2016, several professional athletes protested [[police brutality]] during the [[United States]] (U.S.) [[The Star-Spangled Banner|national anthem]]. The protests began in the [[National Football League]] (NFL) after [[San Francisco 49ers]] [[quarterback]] (QB) [[Colin Kaepernick]] sat during the anthem, as opposed to the tradition of standing, before his team's third [[National Football League preseason|preseason]] game of [[2016 NFL season|2016]]. At first, Kaepernick's quiet demonstrations went unnoticed until a retired Army General named Beret Nate Boyer suggested the quarterback kneel as a more respectful sign toward veterans, which is exactly what made Kaepernick stand out. People started to notice a kneeling player, rather than one who was hidden behind standing players while he sat on the bench.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-06-18|title=All you need to know about why NFL players are taking a knee and where it came from|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/taking-knee-national-anthem-nfl-trump-why-meaning-origins-racism-us-colin-kaepernick-a8521741.html|access-date=2021-05-04|website=The Independent|language=en}}</ref>  The protests have generated mixed reactions and have since spread to other U.S. sports leagues.

Shortly after, his demonstrations spread nationwide to sports on every level, including college football and volleyball, high school football, a Texas youth football team, along with Major League Baseball's (MLB) Oakland A's, the National Basketball Association (NBA), and the U.S. national women's soccer team.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Gregory|first=Sean|title=October 3rd, 2016 {{!}} Vol. 188, No. 13 {{!}} U.S.|url=https://time.com/magazine/us/4503993/october-3rd-2016-vol-188-no-13-u-s/|access-date=2021-05-04|website=TIME.com|date=22 September 2016 }}</ref>  Stemming from the Kaepernick controversy, before the beginning of the [[2016 World Cup of Hockey]] tournament in [[Toronto|Toronto, Canada]], Team USA coach [[John Tortorella]] told in an interview that if any one of his players were to sit out during the anthem, they would sit on the bench for the entire duration of the game.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/world-cup-of-hockey/tortorella-will-sit-anthem-protests-team-usa/|title=Tortorella 'will sit' any Team USA player who protests anthem - Sportsnet.ca|newspaper=Sportsnet.ca|access-date=2017-02-12|language=en-US}}</ref>
By the time the first Sunday of the regular season started in September 2016, several other players starting taking part in Kaepernick's protests, including: his teammate Eric Reid, Seattle Seahawks' Jeremy Lane, Denver Broncos' Brandon Marshall (who lost three endorsement deals for his actions), four Miami Dolphins players, Kansas City Chief's Marcus Peters, and New England Patriots' Martellus Bennett and Devin McCourty. When various players first took part in these acts, the NFL came out with a statement saying that individual teams would receive a fine if its players sat or knelt during the anthem.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Gregory|first=Sean|title=October 3rd, 2016 {{!}} Vol. 188, No. 13 {{!}} U.S.|url=https://time.com/magazine/us/4503993/october-3rd-2016-vol-188-no-13-u-s/|access-date=2021-05-04|website=TIME.com|date=22 September 2016 }}</ref> Kaepernick's Twitter and Instagram platforms were soon filled with acknowledgements about the racial injustice and brutality against young African American men. He publicized his reasoning for why he chose to kneel during the National Anthem. As the protests continued, Colin Kaepernick, the man who started the protests, was featured on the October cover of Time Magazine for stirring up conversations regarding his movement. In September 2018, Nike made Kaepernick the face of its campaign- Believe in something, even if it means sacrificing everything- which promoted debate over his protests and boycotts against Nike. <ref>{{Cite web|title=Colin Kaepernick kneeling timeline: How protests during the national anthem started a movement in the NFL|url=https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/colin-kaepernick-kneeling-protest-timeline/xktu6ka4diva1s5jxaylrcsse|access-date=2021-05-04|website=www.sportingnews.com|language=en}}</ref>

==On the grounds of spectators' experience==
Sports spectators felt the anthem performance was integrated poorly to the sports game. In 1989, on the ''[[New York Times]]'', an opinion wrote, "Nowadays, sports promoters don't even try to get people to participate [by singing along] and the anthem is either presented like an [[aria]] from ''[[Tannh√§user (opera)|Tannhauser]]'' or used as a launch pad for a rock star's ego trip."<ref>{{cite news|first=James|last=Redding|title=Give Us a Better National Anthem and We'll Sing|work=New York Times |date=22 July 1989|page=24|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/07/22/opinion/l-give-us-a-better-national-anthem-and-we-ll-sing-it-525389.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150525122210/https://www.nytimes.com/1989/07/22/opinion/l-give-us-a-better-national-anthem-and-we-ll-sing-it-525389.html|archivedate=2015-05-25}}</ref><ref name="1998 Spiegel"/>

Many sports spectators afraid of being yelled for not conforming sing along as a "joyless act performed for the sake of keeping out of trouble", which relegated the performance to a "mass display of ritualized obedience" and "performative patriotism". It is also argued that playing the anthem thousands of times a year before every sporting event makes the anthem not as special as it deserves to be. Hence, saving the anthem for truly deserving circumstances would make the anthem a genuinely patriotic experience.<ref>{{cite news|title=For the love of America, stop playing the national anthem before sporting events|newspaper=Business Insider|date=2021-02-13|last=Fisher|first=Anthony L.|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/stop-playing-national-anthem-before-sporting-events-patriotism-mark-cuban-2021-2?r=US&IR=T|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20210213133444/https://www.businessinsider.com/stop-playing-national-anthem-before-sporting-events-patriotism-mark-cuban-2021-2?r=US&IR=T|archivedate=2021-02-13}}</ref>
