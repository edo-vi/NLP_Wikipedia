'''Cardiovirus A''' is a member of the ''[[Picornaviridae]]'' family. Infection with the virus causes encephalomyocarditis and reproductive disease in [[pig]]s. Although a variety of [[mammals]] may host the virus, pigs are classed as the domestic host as they are most easily infected. It is thought to be spread by [[rodents]].

The disease can be found worldwide but is of greatest economic importance in tropical areas. It is not thought to be [[zoonotic]].

==Clinical signs and diagnosis==
[[Domestic pig|Piglets]] that are infected present with [[encephalitis]], [[myocarditis]] and sudden death. Mortality rates can be high. If a [[Pig|sow]] is infected whilst pregnant she may present with a variety of reproductive signs including [[infertility]], mummification, [[abortion]], [[still birth]] and the birth of weak piglets. A variety of gastrointestinal, respiratory and systemic signs may also be seen as the virus infects multiple body systems.

A presumptive diagnosis can be made based on the history and clinical signs. Virus isolation is necessary for definitive diagnosis. [[Autopsy|Postmortem examination]] of piglets may or may not reveal cardiac pathology but [[histopathology]] should show cardiac and brain abnormalities. Signs in aborted fetuses are highly variable.
