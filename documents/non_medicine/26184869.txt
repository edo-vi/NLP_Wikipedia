* works inadvertently left unfinished or never completed by their authors
* surviving extracts of larger works subsequently lost as wholes
* works deliberately constructed as fragmentary pieces

The deliberately undeveloped literary sort of fragment played an especially important role in literary [[Romanticism]]. German literature of the Romantic period has left many such fragments. In English literature, note [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]]'s unfinished (but published as a fragment in 1816) "[[Kubla Khan]]; or, A Vision in a Dream: A Fragment".
In contemporary literature [[Dimitris Lyacos]] employs fragment sequences in order to develop an elliptical narrative alluding to a universe of unattainability and loss.<ref>{{cite book |first=Fran |last=Mason |title=Historical Dictionary of Postmodern Literature and Theatre |page=276 |publisher=Rowman and Littlefeld |year=2016 |isbn=9781442276208 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pG-IDQAAQBAJ&pg=PA276 }}</ref>
