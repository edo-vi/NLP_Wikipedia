The '''Royal Philanthropic Vaccine Expedition''' ({{Lang-es|Real Expedición Filantrópica de la Vacuna}}), commonly referred to as the '''Balmis Expedition''', was a Spanish healthcare mission that lasted from 1803 to 1806, led by Dr [[Francisco Javier de Balmis]], which vaccinated millions{{dubious|date=June 2022}} of inhabitants of [[Spanish America]] and Asia against [[smallpox]]. The vaccine was actually transported through children: orphaned boys who sailed with the expedition.

== Background ==
Smallpox, a devastating disease that was endemic throughout much of the [[Old World]], decimated the populations of the Americas after it was introduced by the Spanish conquistadors in the 1500s.<ref name="Tarrago-2001" /> By the late 16th century, smallpox had become endemic throughout Spain's holdings in the Americas and epidemics occurred periodically over the next 300 years.{{sfn |Fenner |1988 |page=237}} 

In the 18th century there were scattered attempts in the colonies to use [[variolation]], an older, less-effective method of [[inoculation]] using smallpox material. These efforts did little to mitigate the epidemics and sometimes actually increased the spread of the contagion.{{sfn |Fenner |1988 |pages=237,256}}

In 1798, English physician [[Edward Jenner]] pioneered the use of a [[vaccine]] to immunize persons with an inoculation of [[cowpox]] material. The new vaccine was a much safer and more effective way to prevent smallpox. At the time, about 400,000 Europeans died each year from the disease which was also responsible for one-third of all cases of blindness in Europe. The use of Jenner's new vaccine spread rapidly through Europe and had a significant positive impact on the severity and frequency of smallpox epidemics.<ref name="Tarrago-2001" />{{sfn |Fenner |1988 |page=231}}

The vaccine first reached Spain in late 1800 and by the end of 1801, several thousand persons had been vaccinated across the country. The efforts were well publicised in Spain and by 1804, dozens of papers, treatises, newspaper articles, and editorials had been published on the smallpox vaccine.{{sfn|Mark|Rigau-Perez|2009}}

In November 1794 the daughter of King [[Charles IV of Spain]], [[Infanta]] Maria Teresa, had died from smallpox. He had heard of the vaccine discovery. Colombia and Ecuador experienced a smallpox epidemic and called on the king for supplies.<ref name="mexico"/>

On 30 November 1803, the expedition set off from [[A Coruña]] in northwest Spain sailing on ''Maria Pita''. It carried 22 orphan boys (aged 3 to 10) to act as carriers of the cowpox virus. The boys were necessary because the vaccine consisted of infecting patients with cowpox, which is a virus closely related to smallpox but produces a much milder disease that confers immunity to both. However, only an active infection could be transferred to successive patients, so two boys were infected with cowpox at the beginning of the voyage, with two more infected at a time as it progressed across the Atlantic and beyond.<ref name=scourge>{{cite book |first=Jonathan B. |last=Tucker |name-list-style=vanc |title=Scourge: The Once and Future Threat of Smallpox |year=2001 |location=New York |publisher=Atlantic Monthly Press |page=[https://archive.org/details/scourgeoncefu00tuck/page/31 31] |isbn=978-0-87113-830-9 |url=https://archive.org/details/scourgeoncefu00tuck/page/31 }}</ref> The medical staff and caretakers for the boys consisted of Balmis, a deputy surgeon, two assistants, two first-aid practitioners, three nurses, and [[Isabel Zendal|Isabel Zendal Gómez]], the [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rectoress]] of ''Casa de Expósitos'', an A Coruña orphanage.<ref>{{cite journal | author = McIntyre JWR, Stuart HC | year = 1999 | title = Medicine in Canada: Smallpox and its control in Canada | url = http://www.cmaj.ca/cgi/content/full/161/12/1543 | journal = [[Canadian Medical Association Journal]] | volume = 161 | issue = 12| pages = 1543–1547 | pmid = 10624414 | pmc=1230874}}</ref>

The mission took the vaccine to the [[Canary Islands]], [[Puerto Rico]], [[Venezuela]], [[Viceroyalty of New Granada|Colombia]], [[Royal Audiencia of Quito|Ecuador]], [[Viceroyalty of Peru|Peru]], [[New Spain|Mexico]], the [[Captaincy General of the Philippines|Philippines]] and [[Qing dynasty|China]].<ref>de Romo, Ana Cecilia Rodríguez (1997).

In [[Puerto Rico]], the local population had already been inoculated from the Danish colony of [[Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands|Saint Thomas]]. In [[Captaincy General of Venezuela|Venezuela]], the expedition divided at [[La Guaira]]. Balmis went to [[Caracas]] and later to [[Havana]].{{cn|date=May 2023}}

At Balmis’ request Cuba sent three enslaved girls to [[Campeche]], Mexico, as additional carriers of the vaccine; following Mexican independence and emancipation, Mexico continued to bring in slaves from Cuba as vaccine carriers.<ref name="mexico">{{Cite news |last=Tenorio |first=Rich |date=2021-02-16 |title=An 1800s vaccine campaign in Mexico offers lessons in beating Covid |language=en-US |work=Mexico News daily |url=https://mexiconewsdaily.com/mexicolife/1800s-smallpox-vaccine-campaign/ |access-date=2022-06-26}}</ref>

The Venezuelan poet [[Andrés Bello]] wrote an ode to Balmis. José Salvany, the deputy surgeon, went toward today's Colombia and the Viceroyalty of Peru (Ecuador, Peru, Chile, and Bolivia). The voyage took seven years and cost Salvany his life, as he died in 1810 in [[Cochabamba]]. In New Spain, Balmis took on 25 more orphans to maintain the infection during the crossing of the Pacific. In the Philippines, they received help from the Catholic church, which was initially reluctant until [[Governor-General of the Philippines|Governor-General]] [[Rafael María de Aguilar y Ponce de León|Rafael Aguilar]] made an example by vaccinating his five children. Balmis sent most of the expedition back to New Spain while he went on to China, where he visited [[Macau]] and [[Guangzhou|Canton]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://opinion.inquirer.net/109261/vaccine-expedition-early-1800s|title=Vaccine expedition in early 1800s|last=Ocampo|first=Ambeth R.|access-date=2017-12-07|newspaper=Philippine Daily Inquirer |date=December 6, 2017}}</ref> On his way back to Spain in 1806, Balmis offered the vaccine to the British authorities in [[Saint Helena]], despite the [[Anglo-Spanish War (1796–1808)]].<ref name="CID" />
