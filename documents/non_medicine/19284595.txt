'''Domestic realism''' normally refers to the genre of 19th-century fictional works about the daily lives of ordinary Victorian women.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Colby |first=Vineta |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/905864445 |title=Yesterday's woman : domestic realism in the English novel |date=1974 |isbn=978-1-4008-7265-7 |location=Princeton, New Jersey |oclc=905864445}}</ref> This body of writing is also known as "[[Sentimental novel|sentimental fiction]]" or "woman's fiction". The genre is mainly reflected in the novel though short-stories and non-fiction works such as [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]]'s "Our Country Neighbors" and ''The New Housekeeper's Manual'' written by Stowe and her sister-in-law [[Catharine Beecher]] are works of domestic realism.

==Generic conventions==
The style's particular characteristics are:

"1. Plot focuses on a heroine who embodies one of two types of exemplar: the angel and the practical woman (Reynolds) who sometimes exist in the same work. Baym says that this heroine is contrasted with the passive woman (incompetent, cowardly, ignorant; often the heroine's mother is this type) and the "belle," who is deprived of a proper education.

2. The heroine struggles for self-mastery, learning the pain of conquering her own passions (Tompkins, Sensational Designs, 172).

3. The heroine learns to balance society's demands for self-denial with her own desire for autonomy, a struggle often addressed in terms of religion.

4. She suffers at the hands of [[abuse of power|abusers of power]] before establishing a network of surrogate kin.

5. The plots "repeatedly identify immersion in feeling as one of the great temptations and dangers for a developing woman. They show that feeling must be controlled. . . " (Baym 25). Frances Cogan notes that the heroines thus undergo a full education within which to realize feminine obligations (The All-American Girl).

6. The tales generally end with marriage, usually one of two possible kinds:

A. Reforming the bad or "wild" male, as in [[Augusta Jane Evans|Augusta Evans]]'s ''St. Elmo'' (1867)

B. Marrying the solid male who already meets her qualifications.
Examples: [[Maria Susanna Cummins|Maria Cummins]], ''[[The Lamplighter]]'' (1854) and [[Susan Warner]], ''[[The Wide, Wide World]]'' (1850) 

7. The novels may use a "language of tears" that evokes sympathy from the readers.

8. [[Richard H. Brodhead|Richard Brodhead]] (Cultures of Letters) sees class as an important issue, as the ideal family or heroine is poised between a lower-class family exemplifying poverty and domestic disorganization and upper-class characters exemplifying an idle, frivolous existence (94)."<ref>Campbell, Donna M. ''Domestic or Sentimental Fiction, 1820-1865'' 21 May 2007. [http://www.wsu.edu/~campbelld/amlit/domestic.htm]</ref>

==Examples==
An example of this style of novel is [[Jane Smiley]]'s ''[[A Thousand Acres]]'' in which the main character's confinement is emphasized in such a way.

Some early exponents of the genre of domestic realism were [[Jane Austen]] and [[Elizabeth Barrett Browning]].
