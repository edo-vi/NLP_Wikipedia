{{short description|Coal mineral based on fossilized fungus}}
'''Funginite''' is a [[maceral]], a component, organic in origin, of [[coal]] or [[oil shale]], that exhibits several different physical properties and characteristics under particular conditions, and its dimensions are based upon its source and place of discovery.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|url=https://energy.usgs.gov/PhotoAtlas/?aid=49|title=Photomicrograph Atlas- Homepage, USGS: Energy Resources Program|website=energy.usgs.gov|access-date=2020-01-23}}</ref> Furthermore, it is primarily part of a group of macerals that naturally occur in rocks containing mostly [[carbon]] constituents, specifically coal. Due to its nature, research into the chemical structure and formula of funginite is considered limited and lacking.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last1=Chen|first1=Y.|last2=Caro|first2=L.

== Etymology ==
The term "funginite" is based on the word "[[fungus]]" that has its roots in Latin, and evolved through to [[Middle English|late middle English]],<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=https://www.lexico.com/en/definition/fungus|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190914002252/https://www.lexico.com/en/definition/fungus|url-status=dead|archive-date=September 14, 2019|title=Fungus {{!}} Definition of Fungus by Lexico|website=Lexico Dictionaries {{!}} English|language=en|access-date=2020-01-23}}</ref> while its suffix "[[wikiwikiweb:-ite|-ite]]" pertains to mineralogical nomenclature. There is speculation that it may have also been derived from [[ancient Greek]] roots, utilizing the word for "sponge" instead.<ref name=":1" />

== Properties ==
Funginite's chemical composition consists primarily of [[carbon]] and [[hydrogen]], and when compared to other macerals in the same group of [[inertinite]]s, its theoretical carbon to oxygen ratio was discovered to be low in comparison.<ref name=":0" /> The maceral was also found to have a low molecular reaction characteristic based on the [[Arrhenius equation]] due to its 'A' factor value, also known as its [[pre-exponential factor]], making funginite nonreactive in comparison to other macerals subjected to the same amount of [[activation energy]] or [[kinetic energy]] in a system.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Physical_and_Theoretical_Chemistry_Textbook_Maps/Supplemental_Modules_(Physical_and_Theoretical_Chemistry)/Kinetics/Modeling_Reaction_Kinetics/Temperature_Dependence_of_Reaction_Rates/The_Arrhenius_Law/Arrhenius_Equation|title=Arrhenius Equation|date=2013-10-02|website=Chemistry LibreTexts|language=en|access-date=2020-02-05}}</ref>

In terms of its official classification and designation, funginite is a part of the teloinertinite subgroup, which is part of the inertinite group of macerals.<ref name=":5" />

Funginite also contains higher amounts of carbon and lower amounts of hydrogen than its maceral counterparts, due to the nature of inertinites, as they generally "contain higher proportions of elemental-carbon and lower proportions of elemental-hydrogen compared to [[vitrinite]]s and [[liptinite]]s<ref>{{Citation|last1=Kandiyoti|first1=Rafael|title=2 - Solid fuels: Origins and characterization|date=2017-01-01|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780081007846000023|work=Solid Fuels and Heavy Hydrocarbon Liquids (Second Edition)|pages=11–23|editor-last=Kandiyoti|editor-first=Rafael|publisher=Elsevier|language=en|doi=10.1016/b978-0-08-100784-6.00002-3|isbn=978-0-08-100784-6|access-date=2020-02-13|last2=Herod|first2=Alan|last3=Bartle|first3=Keith|last4=Morgan|first4=Trevor|editor2-last=Herod|editor2-first=Alan|editor3-last=Bartle|editor3-first=Keith|editor4-last=Morgan|editor4-first=Trevor}}</ref>".

=== Reflectance and Fluorescence ===
Among the other maceral categories, funginite can also be classified under [[huminite]] and/or [[vitrinite]]. Funginite, along with other macerals that fall in the same family such as [[cutinite]] and [[sporinite]], according to one study, exhibits an average [[reflectance]] value of 0.81%, with a [[standard deviation]] of 0.05. The physical characteristics of the "fungal bodies" not only fluctuate and vary, but also determine the constitution of the spores by causing them to be identified as either single celled or multi-celled by nature.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://energy.usgs.gov/PhotoAtlas/?aid=49|title=Photomicrograph Atlas|website=U.S. Geological Survey}}</ref> This was done alongside [[resinite]], and the four coal samples had several trials conducted. The results indicated that funginite was "[[Fluorescence|nonfluorescent]] and [presented] the highest reflectance value",<ref name=":2" /> based on a study conducted by the ICCP.<ref name=":4" />

=== Formation ===
Funginite is primarily found in coal due to the nature of its creation process, which involves a fungal spore or body contaminating resin within trees, and undergoing the heat and pressure process of transformation into coal and other carbon rich substances, which is best summarized as when a "fungus enters a wound in the tree or in the process of rotting the wood or bark can be encapsulated through the release of a [[resin]].<ref name=":3">{{Cite journal|last1=Hower|first1=James C.|last2=O'Keefe|first2=Jennifer M.

Funginite's development, and more broadly inertinite in general, occurs in forests due to the nature of its properties and characteristics. According to Mastalerz et al. 2011, of the primary groups of macerals, inertinites with a high level of fluorescence and reflectance have these particular traits attributed to the temperature of the fires in which they are formed under, as simply put, their "reflectance is directly related to the fire temperature".<ref name=":5">{{Citation|last1=Mastalerz|first1=Maria|title=Chapter 3 - Spontaneous Combustion and Coal Petrology|date=2011-01-01|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780444528582000037|work=Coal and Peat Fires: A Global Perspective|pages=47–62|editor-last=Stracher|editor-first=Glenn B.|publisher=Elsevier|language=en|doi=10.1016/b978-0-444-52858-2.00003-7|isbn=978-0-444-52858-2|access-date=2020-02-13|last2=Drobniak|first2=Agnieszka|last3=Hower|first3=James C.|last4=O’Keefe|first4=Jennifer M. K.|editor2-last=Prakash|editor2-first=Anupma|editor3-last=Sokol|editor3-first=Ellina V.}}</ref> Furthermore, given the nature of macerals in general, and how they are based on formerly living organisms, this generally results in higher concentrations of funginite being found in such locations when coal and charcoal are inspected closely at these sites. Funginite is based on fungal spores, and the density of fungal material being present in forests is considered abundantly higher than in other common locations for inertinites.

The research undertaken into funginite, as well as other similar inertinites, may provide clues into understanding the events of instances regarding natural spontaneous combustion, due to the necessary requirements for that event to occur.<ref name=":5" />

[[File:Bituminous Coal (Washington Coal, Upper Pennsylvanian).jpg|thumb|"Bituminous coal composed of macerals, demonstrating variance between different maceral composition amongst differinent types of coal"]]As of 2010, there has not been sufficient research conducted into the impact on [[petrology]] funginite has, and this includes other inertinites and macerals in general.<ref name=":3" /> It is also assumed that by understanding the constitution of common and uncommon variants and types of coal alike, locating and identifying deposits rich in a particular type of coal may potentially be made easier, as well as the burning characteristics in the scope of petrology and petrochemical fields.

Increased studies into funginite as a constituent of coal may also assist in the identification and selection of [[metallurgical coal]], as it is a fundamental aspect of producing [[Coke (fuel)|coke]], which is a source of fuel for metallurgical works such as steel production.
