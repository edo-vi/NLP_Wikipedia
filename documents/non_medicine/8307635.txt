A '''lead paragraph''' (sometimes shortened to '''lead'''; in the United States sometimes spelled '''lede''') is the opening [[paragraph]] of an article, book chapter, or other written work that summarizes its main ideas.<ref name=mavensword20001128/> Styles vary widely among the different types and genres of publications, from journalistic [[news style|news-style]] leads to a more [[encyclopaedic]] variety.

==Types of leads==
*[[News style#Lead|Journalistic leads]] emphasize grabbing the attention of the reader.<ref>{{cite book |author=Peha & Lester |title=Be a Writer: Your Guide to the Writing Life!: Proven Tips and Powerful Techniques to Help Young Writers Get Started |page=125 |publisher=Leverage Factory |year=2006 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YFMagLZx2vIC&dq=lede+newspaper&pg=PA125|isbn=9780977300006 }}</ref> In journalism, the failure to mention the most important, interesting or attention-grabbing elements of a story in the first paragraph is sometimes called "burying the lead". Most standard news leads include brief answers to the questions of [[5 Ws|who, what, why, when, where, and how]] the key event in the story took place. In newspaper writing, the first paragraph that summarizes or introduces the story is also called the "blurb paragraph", "teaser text" or, in the United Kingdom, the "standfirst".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Spark |first1=David |last2=Harris |first2=Geoffrey |title=Practical Newspaper Reporting |date=2010 |publisher=Sage Publications |isbn=9781473903340 |pages=89, 90, 94, 167}}</ref>
*[[Encyclopedia]] leads tend to define the subject matter as well as emphasize the interesting points of the article.
*[[feature story|Features]] and general articles in [[magazine]]s tend to be somewhere between journalistic and encyclopedian in style and often lack a distinct lead paragraph entirely.

Leads vary enormously in length, intent and content, according to [[genre]].

In [[journalism]], there is the concept of an introductory or summary line or brief paragraph, located immediately above or below the headline, and typographically distinct from the body of the article.<ref name=Standfirst>{{cite web|title=Standfirst|url=http://www.doubletongued.org/index.php/dictionary/standfirst/|work=[[Double-Tongued Dictionary]]|date=15 October 2004|access-date=27 September 2010}}</ref> This can be referred to with a variety of terms, including: the ''standfirst'' (UK),<ref name=Standfirst/> ''kicker'' (US),<ref name=Standfirst/> ''bank head(line)'', ''deck'', ''dek'', or ''subhead'' (US).{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

A [[foreword]] is a piece of writing sometimes placed at the beginning of a [[book]] or other piece of [[literature]], written by someone other than the author to honour or bring credibility to the work, unlike the [[preface]], written by the author, which includes the purpose and scope of the work.<ref>{{cite web | last = Pope| first = Geoff| title = "Foreword" Versus "Forward" | work = Grammar Girl's Quick and Dirty Tips| publisher = Macmillan Holdings, LLC| date = 18 November 2010| url = https://www.quickanddirtytips.com/education/grammar/foreword-versus-forward| access-date = 8 December 2019}}</ref>

==Spelling==
The term is sometimes spelled "lede".<ref name="M-W">{{cite web |url= https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/lede |title=Lede |work=Merriam-Webster Online |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc |location=Chicago, IL, US |date=2012|access-date=2012-02-28}}</ref> The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' suggests this arose as an intentional misspelling of "lead", "in order to distinguish the word's use in instructions to printers from printable text,"<ref name="lede, n.2">{{cite web |title=lede, n.2 |url=https://www.oed.com/view/Entry/431803 |website=Oxford English Dictionary |access-date=1 July 2019}}</ref> similarly to "[[wikt:hed|hed]]" for "head(line)" and "[[wikt:dek|dek]]" for "deck".
