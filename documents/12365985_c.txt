Tendonectomy is the surgical cutting of tendons and is generally only practiced in veterinary medicine.

 In cats 

Performing a tendonectomy on a cat is an alternative to onychectomy ("declawing") which amputates the end of each digit. Tendonectomy may be considered less painful for the cat than onychectomy; however it is not recommended by the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) and is illegal in many countries.

In a tendonectomy a small portion of the tendon in each of a cats toes is surgically removed to prevent the cat from extending the claws. Thus the cat is no longer capable of scratching.

Claws will continue to grow following tendonectomy and because the cat can no longer extend the claws to scratch the cat will not wear down the claws as before. Therefore among other considerations the cat owner should evaluate the ongoing maintenance required in the form of regular claw trimming thereafter when considering this procedure.

In terms of studies on the impact of onychectomy versus tendonectomy the American Veterinary Medical Association compared the outcomes of the two operations in its August 1 1998 issue.  Their report considered owner satisfaction and drawbacks such as pain and future complications.  Cats who underwent tendonectomy displayed significantly lower pain immediately following the procedure versus those who underwent onychectomy.  However both procedures showed an equal frequency of other complications such as bleeding lameness and infection.  Cats took the same number of days to recover from both operations (as measured by normalcy in walking) and owners were equally satisfied with both options.

One complication to watch out for later on in the cats life with a tendonectomy is the nails getting brittle. Nails that are more brittle are prone to splitting and shattering when trimmed by the owner which is quite painful for the cat.
