A fact box is a simplified display format that presents Evidence-based medicine
The format has been shown to improve peopleâ€™s understanding of health-related risk information. Benefits and harms are displayed in Absolute value
Fact box: Main features

There are several key features of a fact box. First a summary statement describes the benefits and harms of a medical treatment without giving an explicit recommendation about which option is optimal for the reader. To avoid any ambiguities in interpreting the content explicit and exhaustive information about the target population (e.g. gender age range) date or time span of data collection and all additional information that may have an influence on the understanding of the reported facts are presented. To inform the user about the most important benefits and harms these are stated explicitly preferably as a list of statements or questions. Moreover a fact box presents comparisons of outcomes usually between treatment and control groups which are based on research results (preferably Meta-analysis
Fact box: Use and implementation

Based on an early format known as the balance sheet this simple tabular format has been adopted by different health organizations e.g. National Health and Medical Research Council United States Preventive Services Task Force
