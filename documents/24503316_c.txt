File:EN1997.svgIn the Eurocode series of European Committee for Standardization
Eurocode 7 is intended to:
*be used in conjunction with EN 1990 which establishes the principles and requirements for safety and serviceability describes the basis of design and verification and gives guidelines for related aspects of structural reliability
*be applied to the geotechnical aspects of the design of buildings and civil engineering works and it is concerned with the requirements for strength stability serviceability and durability of structures.

Eurocode 7 is composed of the following parts

Part 1: General rules
EN 1997-1 is intended to be used as a general basis for the geotechnical aspects of the design of buildings and civil engineering works.

Contents
* General
* Basis of design
* Geotechnical data
* Supervision of construction monitoring and maintenance
* Fill dewatering ground improvement and reinforcement
* Spread foundations
* Deep foundation (pile foundations)
* Anchorages
* Retaining structures
* Hydraulic failure
* Overall stability
* wikt:embankment
EN 1997-1 is accompanied by Annexes A to J which provide:
*Annex A Recommended partial safety factor values; different values of the partial factors may be set by the National annex.
*Annexes B to J Supplementary informative guidance such as internationally applied calculation methods.

Part 2: Ground investigation and testing
EN 1997-2 is intended to be used in conjunction with EN 1997-1 and provides rules supplementary to EN 1997-1 related to planning and reporting of ground investigations general requirements for a range of commonly used laboratory and field tests interpretation and evaluation of test results and derivation of values of geotechnical parameters and coefficients.

Part 3: Design assisted by field testing
There is no longer a Part 3. It was amalgamated into EN 1997-2
