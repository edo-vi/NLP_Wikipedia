A non-renewable resource (also called a finite resource) is a natural resource that cannot be readily replaced by natural means at a pace quick enough to keep up with consumption. An example is carbon-based fossil fuels. The original organic matter with the aid of heat and pressure becomes a fuel such as oil or gas. Earth minerals and metal ores fossil fuels (coal petroleum natural gas) and groundwater in certain aquifers are all considered non-renewable resources though individual Chemical element

Earth minerals and metal ores are examples of non-renewable resources. The metals themselves are present in vast amounts in Earths crust (geology)
The localized deposits of metal ores near the surface which can be extracted economically by humans are non-renewable in human time-frames. There are certain rare earth minerals and rare earth element
 Fossil fuels 



Natural resources such as coal petroleum(crude oil) and natural gas take thousands of years to form naturally and cannot be replaced as fast as they are being consumed. Eventually it is considered that fossil-based resources will become too costly to harvest and humanity will need to shift its reliance to other sources of energy such as solar or wind power see renewable energy.

An alternative hypothesis is that carbon based fuel is virtually inexhaustible in human terms if one includes all sources of carbon-based energy such as methane hydrates on the sea floor which are vastly greater than all other carbon based fossil fuel resources combined. These sources of carbon are also considered non-renewable although their rate of formation/replenishment on the sea floor is not known. However their extraction at economically viable costs and rates has yet to be determined.

At present the main energy source used by humans is non-renewable fossil fuels. Since the dawn of internal combustion engine technologies in the 19th century petroleum and other fossil fuels have remained in continual demand. As a result conventional infrastructure and transport systems which are fitted to combustion engines remain prominent throughout the globe.

The modern-day fossil fuel economy is widely criticized for its lack of renewability as well as being a contributor to climate change.

In 1987 the World Commission on Environment and Development (WCED) classified fission reactors that produce more fissile nuclear fuel than they consume (i.e. breeder reactors) among conventional renewable energy sources such as Sun
The use of nuclear technology relying on Nuclear fission
As of 2013 only a few kilograms (picture available) of uranium have been extracted from the ocean in pilot programs and it is also believed that the uranium extracted on an industrial scale from the seawater would constantly be replenished from uranium leaching (metallurgy)
Nuclear power provides about 6% of the worlds energy and 13â€“14% of the worlds electricity. Nuclear energy production is associated with potentially dangerous radioactive contamination as it relies upon unstable elements. In particular nuclear power facilities produce about 200000 metric tons of low and intermediate level waste (LILW) and 10000 metric tons of high level waste (HLW) (including spent fuel designated as waste) each year worldwide.

Issues entirely separate from the question of the sustainability of nuclear fuel relate to the use of nuclear fuel and the high-level radioactive waste the nuclear industry generates that if not properly contained is Acute radiation syndrome

Land surface can be considered both renewable and non-renewable resource depending on the scope of comparison. land economics

The renewable energy from the sun wind surface wave
The potential wave energy on coastlines can provide 1/5 of world demand. Hydroelectric power can supply 1/3 of our total energy global needs. Geothermal energy can provide 1.5 more times the energy we need. There is enough wind to power the planet 30 times over wind power could power all of humanitys needs alone. Solar currently supplies only 0.1% of our world energy needs but there is enough out there to power humanitys needs 4000 times over the entire global projected energy demand by 2050.
