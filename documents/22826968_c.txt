A vaccine-preventable disease is an infectious disease for which an effective preventive vaccine exists. If a person acquires a vaccine-preventable disease and dies from it the death is considered a vaccine-preventable death.

The most common and serious vaccine-preventable diseases tracked by the World Health Organization (WHO) are: diphtheria Haemophilus influenzaeHaemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) infection
Background
In 2012 the World Health Organization estimated that vaccination prevents 2.5 million deaths each year. With 100% immunization and 100% efficacy of the vaccines one out of seven deaths among young children could be prevented mostly in developing countries making this an important global health issue. Four diseases were responsible for 98% of vaccine-preventable deaths: measles Haemophilus influenzae
The Immunization Surveillance Assessment and Monitoring program of the WHO monitors and assesses the safety and effectiveness of programs and vaccines at reducing morbidity
Vaccine-preventable deaths are usually caused by a failure to obtain the vaccine in a timely manner. This may be due to financial constraints or to lack of access to the vaccine. A vaccine that is generally recommended may be contraindicated
