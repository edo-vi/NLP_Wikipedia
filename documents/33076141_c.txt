M. hyorhinis can prevent cell death caused by nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase inhibitors.

Clinical signs and diagnosis
A variety of clinical signs are seen in piglets less than 10-weeks old.

Lameness polyserositis and joint swelling are the most common symptoms. A foul-smelling discharge from the ears can occur secondary to otitis. Less specific signs include poor coat quality pyrexia cardiovascular gastrointestinal neurological and respiratory signs.

Bacterial culture Immunofluorescence
Human pathogenicity
There is some evidence implicating M. hyorhinis in the pathogenesis of scleroderma a chronic systemic disease of humans. One study isolated the bacteria from scleroderma patients. Another study found that injecting M. hyorhinis into mice induces a scleroderma-like autoimmune disease. However more research is needed to confirm or refute the link between M. hyorhinis and scleroderma.

Treatment
Antibiotics are the treatment of choice.
