Vaccination Week In The Americas (VWA) is an annual public health campaign by the member states of the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) to promote equity and access to immunization. It is marked each year during the last week of April.

Since 2012 the campaign has been celebrated globally across all regions of the World Health Organization (WHO) under World Immunization Week. The WHO reports there are 25 vaccine-preventable diseases
History
File:Typhoid inoculation2.jpgVWA was initially proposed and implemented on April 23 2002 under the presidency of Dr. Patricio Jamriska Secretary of Health of the Republic of Ecuador and by the Ministers of Health in the Andean Region following a measles outbreak in Venezuela and Colombia. Originally endorsed through the adoption of Resolution CD44.R by the Directing Council of the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) the overarching objectives of VWA are to
promote equity and access to immunization and strengthen immunization programs in the Region of the Americas by “reaching the unreached” populations with otherwise limited access to regular health services and at heightened risk of contracting vaccine-preventable diseases. In the Americas such populations can be found in areas such as urban fringes low coverage municipalities indigenous communities and rural and/or border zones.

VWA has been used to conduct large-scale vaccination campaigns introduce new vaccines carry out communication and social mobilization campaigns and to integrate other health promotion measures. Since its launch in 2003 over 365 million individuals have been vaccinated through campaigns conducted under the framework of the initiative.

In April 2012 PAHO joined the other five WHO regions to celebrate World Immunization Week. This followed the launch of European Immunization Week (EIW) in the WHO European region in 2005 and Vaccination Week campaigns launched in the WHO Eastern Mediterranean region in 2010 and in the WHO African and Western Pacific regions in 2011. The member states of the WHO South-East Asian region committed to the annual campaign in 2012.
