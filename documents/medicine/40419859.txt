Besides systematic reviews, the core evidence-based tool, such approaches include ''inter alia'' the establishment and universal use of a common ontology, justified design and rigorous conduct of studies, consistently structured and detailed reporting of experimental evidence, probabilistic uncertainty and risk assessment, and the development of synthesis methodology to integrate evidence from diverse evidence streams, e.g. from human observational studies, animal studies, in vitro studies and in silico modeling. A main initial impetus for translating evidence-based approaches to toxicology was the need to improve the performance assessment of toxicological test methods.<ref name=hoff05>{{cite journal|last=Hoffmann|first=S.|author2=Hartung, T|title=Diagnosis: toxic!

A key tool in evidence-based medicine that holds promise for EBT is the systematic review.  Historically, authors of reviews assessing the results of toxicological studies on a particular topic have searched, selected, and weighed the scientific evidence in a non-systematic and non-transparent way.  Due to their narrative nature, these reviews tend to be subjective, potentially biased, and not readily reproducible.<ref name=hoff06 />  Two examples highlighting these deficiencies are the risk assessments of trichloroethylene and bisphenol A (BPA).  Twenty-seven different risk assessments of the evidence that trichloroethylene causes cancer have come to substantially different conclusions.<ref name=ruden03>{{cite journal|last=Rudén|first=C.|title=The use and evaluation of primary data in 29 trichloroethylene carcinogen risk assessments|journal=Regul Toxicol Pharmacol|year=2001|volume=34|issue=1|pages=3–16|doi=10.1006/rtph.2001.1482|pmid=11502152}}</ref> Assessments of BPA range from low risk of harm to the public to potential risks (for some populations), leading to different political decisions.<ref name=whaley>{{cite journal|last=Whaley|first=P.|author2=Halsall, C. |author3=Ågerstrand, R.A. |author4=Aiassa, E. |title=Implementing systematic review techniques in chemical risk assessment: Challenges, opportunities and recommendations.|journal=Environ Int|year=2016|volume=92-93|pages=556–564|doi=10.1016/j.envint.2015.11.002|pmid=26687863|pmc=4881816|display-authors=etal}}</ref> Systematic reviews can help reducing such divergent views.<ref name=stephens13 /> In contrast with narrative reviews, they reflect a highly structured approach to reviewing and synthesizing the scientific literature while limiting bias.<ref name=stephens13 />  The steps to carrying out a systematic review include framing the question to be addressed; identifying and retrieving relevant studies; determining if any retrieved studies should be excluded from the analysis; and appraising the included studies in terms of their methodological quality and risk of bias.  Ultimately the data should be synthesized across studies, if possible by a meta-analysis.  A protocol of how the review will be conducted is prepared ahead of time and ideally should be registered and/or published.

Scientists have made progress in their efforts to apply the systematic review framework to evaluating the evidence for associations between environmental toxicants and human health risks.  To date, researchers have shown that important elements of the framework established in evidence-based medicine can be adapted to toxicology with little change, and some studies have been attempted.<ref name=Navas-Acien05>{{cite journal|last=Navas-Acien|first=A.|author2=Sharrett, A.R. |author3=Silbergeld, E.K. |title=Arsenic exposure and cardiovascular disease: a systematic review of the epidemiologic evidence|journal=Am J Epidemiol|year=2005|volume=162|issue=11|pages=1037–1049|doi=10.1093/aje/kwi330|pmid=16269585|display-authors=etal|doi-access=free}}</ref><ref name=krauth>{{cite journal|last=Krauth|first=D.|author2=Woodruff, T.J. |author3=Bero, L. |title=Instruments for assessing risk of bias and other methodological criteria of published animal studies: a systematic review|journal=Environ Health Perspect|year=2013|volume=121|issue=9|pages=985–992|doi=10.1289/ehp.1206389|pmid=23771496|pmc=3764080|display-authors=etal}}</ref><ref name=silberalt13>{{cite journal|last=Silbergeld|first=E.|author2=Scherer, R.W.|title=Evidence-based toxicology: Strait is the gate, but the road is worth taking|journal=ALTEX|year=2013|volume=30|issue=1|pages=67–73|doi=10.14573/altex.2013.1.067|pmid=23338807|doi-access=free}}</ref> Researchers using the systematic review methodology to address toxicological concerns include a group of scientists from government, industry, and academia in North America and the European Union (EU) who have joined together to promote evidence-based approaches to toxicology through the nonprofit [[Evidence-based Toxicology Collaboration]] (EBTC).

== Background ==

Evidence-based approaches were first conceived as a means of anchoring policy decisions, not to current practices or the beliefs of experts, but to experimental evidence.<ref name=Eddy>{{cite journal|last=Eddy|first=D.M.|title=Practice Policies: Guidelines for Methods.|journal=JAMA|year=1990|volume=263|issue=13|pages=1839–1841|doi=10.1001/jama.1990.03440130133041}}</ref>  [[Evidence-based medicine]] (EBM) was launched slightly later. Its rise as a distinct discipline is generally credited to the work and advocacy of Scottish epidemiologist Archie Cochrane.<ref>{{cite book|last=Mayer|first=D.|title=Essential Evidence-Based Medicine|year=2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press.|location=New York}}</ref>  The [[Cochrane Collaboration]] named in his honor was launched at Oxford University in 1993 to promote evidence-based reviews of clinical medical literature. More recently, EBM expanded to encompass [[evidence-based health care]] (EBHC).

EBM/HC involves the conscientious, explicit, and judicious use of current best evidence in making decisions about the care of individual patients taking patients' preferences into account.<ref name=Sackett>{{cite journal|last=Sackett|first=D.L.|author2=Rosenberg, W.M. |author3=Gray, J.A. |author4=Haynes, R.B. |title=Evidence based medicine: what it is and what it isn't|journal=BMJ|year=1996|volume=312|issue=7023|pages=71–72|display-authors=etal |doi=10.1136/bmj.312.7023.71|pmid=8555924|pmc=2349778}}</ref>  Prior to EBM, medical decisions about diagnosis, prevention, treatment or harm were often made without a rigorous evaluation of the alternatives.  Research in the 1970s and 1980s showed that different physicians regularly recommended different treatments and tests for patients with ailments that were essentially the same, and that large proportions of procedures being performed by physicians were considered inappropriate by the standards of medical experts.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Wennberg|first=J.E.|author2=Gittelsohn, A.|title=Small Area Variations in Health Care Delivery|journal=Science|year=1973|volume=182|issue=4117|pages=1102–1108|doi=10.1126/science.182.4117.1102|pmid=4750608|bibcode=1973Sci...182.1102W|s2cid=43819003}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Chassin|first=M.R.|author2=Kosecoff J. |author3=Solomon D.H. |author4=Brook R.H. |title=How Coronary Angiography Is Used: Clinical Determinants of Appropriateness|journal=JAMA|year=1987|volume=258|issue=18|pages=2543–2547|doi=10.1001/jama.258.18.2543 |pmid=3312657}}</ref>
EBM/HC supporters stress that while evidence always has been important to the practice of medicine, EBM/HC provides an enhanced approach of identifying, assessing, and summarizing evidence.  EBT's supporters make a similar argument.<ref name="stephens13" />

The idea of translating evidence-based approaches from medicine to toxicology has been percolating for two decades, with proponents in both medicine and toxicology.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Buckley|first=N.A.|author2=Smith, A.J.|title=Evidence-based medicine in toxicology: where is the evidence?|journal=Lancet|year=1996|volume=347|issue=9009|pages=1167–1169|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(96)90615-7|pmid=8609755|s2cid=28749027}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Dodes|first=J.E.|title=The amalgam controversy – an evidence-based analysis|journal=J Am Dent Assoc|year=2001|volume=132|pages=348–356|doi=10.14219/jada.archive.2001.0178|pmid=11258092|issue=3}}</ref>  Three research papers published in 2005 and 2006 catalyzed what eventually became known as EBT by suggesting that EBM's established tools and concepts might serve as a prototype of evidence-based decision-making in toxicology.<ref name=hoff06 /><ref name=hoff05 /><ref name=guzelian>{{cite journal|last=Guzelian|first=P.S.|author2=Victoroff, M.S. |author3=Halmes, N.C. |title=Evidence-based toxicology: a comprehensive framework for causation|journal=Hum Exp Toxicol|year=2005|volume=24|issue=4|pages=161–201|doi=10.1191/0960327105ht517oa|pmid=15957536|s2cid=5359374|display-authors=etal}}</ref>

== Process and progress ==

The First International Forum Toward Evidence-Based Toxicology was held in 2007.<ref name=Hoffman07>{{cite journal|last=Hoffman|first=S.|author2=Griesinger, C. |author3=Coecke, S. |author4=Kinser, A. |title=1st International Forum Towards Evidence-Based Toxicology.|journal=ALTEX|year=2007|volume=24|pages=354–355|display-authors=etal}}</ref> The forum was organized by the European Commission and attended by 170 scientists from more than 25 European, American, and Asian countries.  The goal was to explore the available concepts of EBT, and to launch an initiative to formally implement evidence-based assessment methods in toxicology.

The starting point for the discussions were two research papers suggesting that the tools and concepts established in evidence-based medicine could serve as a prototype of evidence-based decision-making for evaluating toxicological data.<ref name=hoff06 /><ref name=hoff05 />  Apparent fundamental differences between medicine and toxicology were carefully considered during these discussions.  Forum participants attempted to bridge the two disciplines in order to make use of the accrued wisdom and apply this approach to toxicology.  (See [http://www.ebtox.org/resources/evidence-based-toxicology-explained/ ] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170729132040/http://www.ebtox.org/resources/evidence-based-toxicology-explained/ |date=2017-07-29 }} .)

The proceedings of this forum were published as a special issue in ''Human & Experimental Toxicology''.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Proceedings of the 1st International Forum Towards Evidence-Based Toxicology|journal=Hum Exp Toxicol|year=2009|volume=28|issue=2–3|pages=71–163|doi=10.1177/0960327109102802|pmid=19713364|last1=Guzelian|first1=P.S.|last2=Victoroff|first2=M.S.|last3=Halmes|first3=C.|last4=James|first4=R.C.|doi-access=free}}</ref>

EBT's proponents include experts in EBM, public health, and toxicology who believe that EBT can help toxicologists to better serve the goals of health protection and safety assurance.<ref name=silberalt13 /><ref name="Stephens16" /> They argue that EBT's methodologies for collecting, appraising, and pooling evidence can help ensure that all available information on a given topic is evaluated in a transparent, unbiased, and reproducible manner. They contend that EBT's concept of the systematic review could prove particularly helpful for the standardization and quality assurance of novel methodologies for evaluating toxicity, as well as for their formal validation.  In this regard, EBT may prove particularly useful for assessing the performance of newer non-animal "21st century" toxicology tools.  EBT can also help scientists integrate new toxicological test methods into test strategies being implemented across the globe.

In 2010, a group of EBT supporters joined together to convene a workshop titled "21st Century Validation for 21st Century Tools".<ref>{{cite journal|last=Rudacille|first=D.|title=Summary of the July 2010 Workshop, "21st Century Validation Strategies for 21st Century Tools"|journal=ALTEX|year=2010|volume=27|issue=2|pages=279–284|doi=10.14573/altex.2010.4.279|doi-access=free}}</ref>  The session on the potential for evidence-based approaches to assess the performance of the new generation of non-animal test methods inspired the formation of the EBTC.   The EBTC was officially launched in the U.S. in 2011 at a Society of Toxicology conference<ref name=":1">{{cite journal|title=Conference Report: Evidence-based Toxicology Collaboration Kick-off Meeting|journal=Altex|year=2011|volume=28|issue=2|pages=52}}</ref> and convened its first workshop in 2012.<ref name=stephens13 />  The EBTC's EU branch was officially opened during the 2012 Eurotox conference.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hoffmann|first=S.|title=Kick-off of the Evidence-Based Toxicology Collaboration Europe.|journal=ALTEX|volume=29|pages=456}}</ref>

In 2014, the EBTC hosted a workshop on ‘The Emergence of Systematic Review and Related Evidence-based Approaches in Toxicology" with speakers representing US and European organizations that are implementing and promoting the use of systematic reviews for toxicological questions.  The experts noted that the structured approach of systematic reviews increases objectivity and transparency but also made clear that the approach requires a substantial time investment, which is a challenge to its more widespread adoption. Consequently, the participants called for close collaboration of interested organizations, which they determined to be a pre-requisite for the broad and efficient introduction of systematic reviews in toxicology.<ref name=":1" />

== Applications of EBT ==

=== Regulatory decision-making ===

Some scientists and policymakers would like EBT to help them combine information from various sources.  Toxicological evidence can be assigned to evidence streams, sets of studies representing the same type or level of evidence, such as human (observational) studies, animal studies, in vitro or mechanistic studies.  EBT can be applied both within one evidence stream, and it is especially well-suited to be applied across multiple evidence streams.  Regulators often designate one study as "the lead study", then use later studies as additional information.  Many perceive this as unsatisfying, but objective approaches to combine study results are lacking. The EBM concept of the systematic review has promise for this application, and some structured reviews serve as forerunners for this approach.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Navas-Ancien|first=A.|author2=Guallar, E. |author3=Silbergeld, E.K. |author4=Rothenberg, S.J. |title=Lead exposure and cardiovascular disease – a systematic review|journal=Environ Health Perspect|year=2007|volume=115|issue=3|pages=472–482 |doi=10.1289/ehp.9785 |pmid=17431501 |pmc=1849948}}</ref>
<ref>{{cite journal|title=Scientific Opinion on the risk assessment peri- and post-menopausal women taking food supplements containing isoflavones.|journal=EFSA Journal|year=2015|volume=13|issue=10|pages=4246–4588|doi=10.2903/j.efsa.2015.4246|doi-access=free}}</ref><ref name=":0">{{cite web|title=Systematic literature review on the effects of fluoride on learning and memory in animal studies.|url=https://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/ntp/results/pubs/rr/reports/rr01_508.pdf|publisher=National Toxicology Program|access-date=July 29, 2017}}</ref>

=== Evaluating effects of environmental exposures ===

The U.S. National Toxicology Program's Office of Health Assessment and Translation (OHAT) has started to use systematic review methodology for the program's evaluations.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/ntp/ohat/pubs/handbookjan2015_508.pdf|title=Handbook for Conducting a Literature-Based Health Assessment Using Office of Health Assessment and Translation (OHAT) Approach for Systematic Review and Evidence Integration|date=2015|publisher=National Toxicology Program|access-date=2017-07-30}}</ref>  The first systematic review was completed in 2016, reviewing the effects of fluoride on learning and memory in animal studies.<ref name=":0" />  OHAT’s approach is tailored to its mandate, but its seems especially appropriate for substances with substantial yet conflicting literature, and hence the need for systematic reviews to sort out somewhat confusing situations.

=== Causation ===

One application of EBT focuses on causation.<ref name=guzelian />  It addresses the challenge of tracing a health effect back to a toxicant, such as lung cancer to smoking.  This approach is similar to legal arguments<ref>{{cite journal|last=Rodricks|first=J.V.|title=Evaluating disease causation in humans exposed to toxic substances|journal=J Law Policy|year=2006|volume=41|pages=62}}</ref>  Some experts warn that this approach could increase the evidence burden for proving causation, and thereby increase the difficulty involved in banning toxic substances.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Rudén|first=C.|author2=Hansson, S. O.|title=Evidence-based toxicology: "sound science" in new disguise|journal=Int J Occup Environ Health|year=2008|volume=14|issue=4|pages=299–306|doi=10.1179/oeh.2008.14.4.299|pmid=19043917|s2cid=24010570}}</ref>

=== Clinical toxicology ===

Practitioners of clinical toxicology, which is concerned with the treatment of patients known to be exposed to toxic substances, are also beginning to use an EBM-style approach.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Dargan|first=P.I.|author2=Wallace, C.I. |author3=Jones, A.L. |title=An evidence based flowchart to guide the management of acute salicylate (aspirin) overdose|journal=Emerg Med J|year=2002|volume=19|issue=3|pages=206–209|doi=10.1136/emj.19.3.206|pmid=11971828|pmc=1725844}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Wallace|first=C..I.|author2=Dargan, P.I. |author3=Jones, A.L. |title=Paracetamol overdose: an evidence based flowchart to guide management|journal=Emerg Med J|year=2002|volume=19|issue=3|pages=202–205|doi=10.1136/emj.19.3.202|pmid=11971827|pmc=1725876}}</ref>  Guidance documents based on this approach have already been published

=== 21st century toxicology ===

The National Research Council's (NRC) landmark 2007 publication, Toxicity Testing in the 21st Century, has also been an impetus for EBT. EBT provides new tools for assessing test method performance.  Also, as the focus of 21st-century toxicology shifts from animal biology to human biology, EBT provides a method for comparatively evaluating the results gleaned from new methods of investigating the effects of chemical exposure.<ref name="hart09">{{cite journal|last=Hartung|first=T.|year=2009|title=Food for thought ... on evidence-based toxicology|journal=ALTEX|volume=26|issue=2|pages=75–82|doi=10.14573/altex.2009.2.75|pmid=19565165|doi-access=free}}</ref>

The [[Evidence-based Toxicology Collaboration]] has pioneered a number of projects aimed at applying EBT approaches and systematic reviews to test methods comparison.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Stephens|first1=Martin L.|last2=Akgün-Ölmez|first2=Sevcan Gül|last3=Hoffmann|first3=Sebastian|last4=de Vries|first4=Rob|last5=Flick|first5=Burkhard|last6=Hartung|first6=Thomas|last7=Lalu|first7=Manoj|last8=Maertens|first8=Alexandra|last9=Witters|first9=Hilda|last10=Wright|first10=Robert|last11=Tsaioun|first11=Katya|date=2018-06-13|title=Adaptation of the Systematic Review Framework to the Assessment of Toxicological Test Methods: Challenges and Lessons Learned with the Zebrafish Embryotoxicity Test|journal=Toxicological Sciences |volume=171|pages=56–68|doi=10.1093/toxsci/kfz128|issn=1096-0929|pmc=6736188|pmid=31192353}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Dirven|first1=Hubert|last2=Vist|first2=Gunn E.|last3=Bandhakavi|first3=Sricharan|last4=Mehta|first4=Jyotsna|last5=Fitch|first5=Seneca E.|last6=Pound|first6=Pandora|last7=Ram|first7=Rebecca|last8=Kincaid|first8=Breanne|last9=Leenaars|first9=Cathalijn H.C.|last10=Chen|first10=Minjun|last11=Wright|first11=Robert A.|date=2021-03-18|title=Performance of preclinical models in predicting drug-induced liver injury in humans: a systematic review|journal=Scientific Reports|volume=11|issue=1|pages=6403|doi=10.1038/s41598-021-85708-2|issn=2045-2322|pmc=7973584|pmid=33737635}}</ref>

== Limitations and challenges ==

The specific differences between toxicology and medicine/health care cause challenges for implementing EBT.<ref name=silberalt13 /> Evidence-based methodology of clinical research has been focused on a single type of study—randomized, controlled clinical trials, which are a direct measure of the effectiveness of the health care intervention under scrutiny.  In contrast, toxicology employs a variety of different kinds of studies in three distinct evidence streams:  human (observational) studies, animal studies, and non-animal studies.  Because human evidence is frequently lacking most evidence is obtained by using animal and non-animal models, which—by definition—is more difficult to generalize and extrapolate to humans.  This methodological heterogeneity complicates evidence integration within an evidence stream, such as when inconsistent evidence is obtained from different animal species, but even more so across evidence streams.  Adding to the difficulty is the reality that much toxicological evidence, more so than in medicine and health care, is not readily accessible in the literature.<ref name=stephens13 /><ref name=silberalt13 />  Moreover, the role of expert judgment, especially in systematic reviews, needs to be clearly defined, as it is a common misperception that evidence-based approaches leave no room for it.  Systematic reviews should strive to make expert judgments clear along with the scientific basis for those judgments in developing conclusions for a systematic review.  Further issues to be worked out include exposures to multiple substances, the multitude of outcomes observed in some animal studies, and challenges in improving the experimental designs and reporting of studies.
