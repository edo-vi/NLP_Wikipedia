{{short description|Ingredients used in a vaccine dose}}
[[File:WHO EN Vaccines Topic Two Ingredients static 8Dec2020.jpg|thumb|282x282px|Graphic from the World Health Organization describing the main ingredients typically in vaccines]]
A [[vaccine]] dose contains many ingredients (stabilizers, adjuvants, residual inactivating ingredients, residual cell culture materials, residual antibiotics and preservatives) very little of which is the active ingredient, the [[immunogen]]. A single dose may have merely nanograms of virus particles, or micrograms of bacterial polysaccharides. A vaccine injection, oral drops or nasal spray is mostly water. Other ingredients are added to boost the immune response, to ensure safety or help with storage, and a tiny amount of material is left-over from the manufacturing process. Very rarely, these materials can cause an allergic reaction in people who are very sensitive to them.

==Volume==
[[File:Szczepionka strep pneu.jpg|thumb|Multi-dose vaccine in a vial, prepared for injection by syringe]]

The volume of a vaccine dose is influenced by the [[route of administration]]. While some vaccines are given orally or nasally, most require an injection. Vaccines are not injected [[intravenous]]ly into the bloodstream. Most injections deposit a small dose [[Intramuscular injection|into a muscle]], but some are given [[Intradermal injection|superficially just under the skin surface]] or [[Subcutaneous injection|deeper beneath the skin]].<ref name="BNFvaccines">{{cite web |last1=Joint Formulary Committee |title=VACCINES |url=https://bnf.nice.org.uk/drug-class/vaccines.html |website=British National Formulary |publisher=BMJ Group and Pharmaceutical Press |access-date=27 December 2020|date=7 December 2018}}</ref>

Some vaccines come with the active ingredients already suspended in solution and the syringe pre-filled (e.g., Bexsero [[Meningococcal vaccine#Serogroup B|meningococcal Group B vaccine]]<ref name="emcBexsero"/>). Others are supplied as a vial of freeze-dried powder, which is reconstituted prior to administration using a dilutant from a separate vial or pre-filled syringe (e.g., [[MMR vaccine]]<ref name="emcMMRVAXPRO"/>). Infanrix hexa, the [[Hexavalent vaccine|6-in-1 vaccine]] that protects against six diseases, uses a combination approach: the Hib vaccine in the powder and DTPa-HBV-IPV in suspension.<ref name="emcInfanrixHexa"/> Alternatively two separate vaccine solutions are mixed just before administration (ViATIM [[hepatitis&nbsp;A and typhoid vaccine]]).<ref name="emcViATIM"/>

==Immunogens==
Many vaccines developed in the 20th century contain whole bacteria or viruses, which are either inactivated (killed), attenuated (weakened) or a strain chosen to be harmless in humans. Since these are so small, even a tiny amount of them contains a huge number of individuals.<ref name="ovgTypes">{{cite web |title=Types of vaccine |url=https://vk.ovg.ox.ac.uk/vk/types-of-vaccine |website=Vaccine Knowledge Project |publisher=Oxford Vaccine Group |access-date=16 January 2020 |date=12 January 2019}}</ref>

With bacterial vaccines, we can enumerate this with an approximate number of bacteria cells. The live [[Ty21a|typhoid vaccine]] contains two billion viable cells of [[Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica|''Salmonella enterica'' subsp. enterica serovar Typhi]], which have been attenuated and cannot cause disease.<ref name="emcVivotif"/> The cholera vaccine has over thirty billion of each of four strains of ''[[Vibrio cholerae]]'', which are inactivated by heat or formalin.<ref name="emcDukoral"/> The BCG vaccine, infant dose, contains between 100,000 and 400,000 [[colony-forming unit]] of live attenuated ''[[Mycobacterium bovis]]''.<ref name="emcBCG"/>

One way to [[Virus quantification|count viruses]] is to observe their impact on host cells in [[tissue culture]]s. The two tablets of adenovirus vaccine, one with [[adenovirus]] type{{nbs}}4 and the other with type{{nbs}}7, each contain 32,000 tissue-culture infective doses (10<sup>4.5</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub>).<ref name="fdaAdenovirus"/> The current live polio vaccine contains two serotypes of [[poliovirus]]: over 1{{nbs}}billion tissue-culture infective doses (10<sup>6</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub>) of type{{nbs}}1 and over 630,000 (10<sup>5.8</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub>) of type{{nbs}}3.<ref name="gskPolio"/> The smallpox vaccine contains between 250,000 and 1,250,000 [[Plaque-forming unit|plaque forming units]] of live [[vaccina]] virus per dose.<ref name="fdaACAM2000"/> The MMR vaccine contains 1,000 TCID<sub>50</sub> [[Measles morbillivirus|measles]], 12,500 TCID<sub>50</sub> [[Mumps virus|mumps]] and 1,000 TCID<sub>50</sub> [[Rubella virus|rubella]] live attenuated viruses.<ref name="emcMMRVAXPRO"/>

Many modern vaccines are made of only the parts of the pathogen necessary to invoke an immune response (a [[subunit vaccine]]){{snd}}for example just the surface proteins of the virus, or only the polysaccharide coating of a bacterium. Some vaccines invoke an immune response against the toxin produced by bacteria, rather than the bacteria itself. These [[toxoid]] vaccines are used against [[Tetanospasmin|tetanus]], [[Diphtheria toxin|diphtheria]] and [[Pertussis toxin|pertussis]] (whooping cough). If the bacteria polysaccharide coating produces only a weak immune response on its own, it may be combined with (carried on) a protein that does provoke a strong response, which in turn improves the response to the weaker component. Such [[conjugate vaccine]]s, may make use of a toxoid as the carrier protein.<ref name="ovgTypes"/> For all these, the quantity of immunogen is given by weight and sometimes expressed as [[international unit]]s (IU). The HVP vaccine contains 120 micrograms of the L1 capsid proteins from four types of ''[[human papillomavirus]]''.<ref name="emcGardasil"/> The [[pneumococcal conjugate vaccine]] contains 32 micrograms of pneumococcal polysaccharide conjugated with [[CRM197|CRM<sub>197</sub>]] (a [[diphtheria toxin]]).<ref name="emcPrevenar"/>

Another variant is the [[RNA vaccine]], which contains [[Messenger RNA|mRNA]] embedded in lipid (fat) nanoparticles. The mRNA instructs body's own cell machinery to produce the proteins that stimulate the immune response.<ref name="ovgTypes"/> Comirnaty, the [[Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine]] contains thirty micrograms of BNT162b2 RNA.<ref name="govBNT162b2">{{cite web |title=Information for Healthcare Professionals on Pfizer/BioNtech Vaccine |url=https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/948517/Information_for_Healthcare_Professionals_on_Pfizer_BioNTech.pdf |website=GOV.UK |access-date=16 January 2021 |date=December 2020}}</ref>

==Excipients==
{{Main|Excipient}}

Excipients are substances present in the vaccine that are not the principal immunological agents. These may be present to enhance the vaccine's potency, ensure safety, aid with storage or are left over from the manufacturing process.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Kocourkova|first1=Aneta|last2=Honegr|first2=Jan|last3=Kuca|first3=Kamil|last4=Danova|first4=Jana|date=2017-02-01|title=Vaccine Ingredients: Components that Influence Vaccine Efficacy|journal=Mini-Reviews in Medicinal Chemistry|language=en|volume=17|issue=5|pages=451–466|doi=10.2174/1389557516666160801103303|pmid=27488583}}</ref>

===Adjuvants===
{{Main|Immunologic adjuvant}}

Live vaccines produce a strong immune response that lasts a long time, but they are not suitable for people with weakened immune systems. Other kinds of vaccine, where the pathogen has been inactivated or that contain only part of the pathogen, often alone produce a weaker response and require booster doses. In these vaccines, a substance called an [[adjuvant]] is added to make the immune response stronger and longer lasting.<ref name="ovgTypes"/>{{sfn|Garçon|Friede|2018|p=61}}

The most commonly used adjuvants are aluminium salts such as [[aluminium hydroxide]], [[aluminium phosphate]] or [[potassium aluminium sulphate]] (also simply called alum).{{sfn|Garçon|Friede|2018|p=61}}<ref name="ovgIngredients">{{cite web |title=Vaccine ingredients |url=https://vk.ovg.ox.ac.uk/vk/vaccine-ingredients |website=Vaccine Knowledge Project |publisher=Oxford Vaccine Group |access-date=28 December 2020 |date=30 August 2019}}</ref> These aluminium salts can be responsible for soreness and redness at the vaccination site but do not cause any long-term harm to human health. The amount of aluminium in these vaccines ranges from 0.125 milligrams in the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine to 0.82 milligrams in the 6-in-1 vaccine. The Meningococcal Group B vaccine contains 0.5 milligrams and in the [[Vaccination schedule#United Kingdom|UK Immunisation Schedule]] is given at the same time as the 6-in-1 vaccine at eight and sixteen weeks, giving a combined dose of 1.32 milligrams of aluminium. Aluminium salts are commonly and naturally consumed in small quantities, and the quantity in this combined vaccine dose is lower than the weekly safe intake level.<ref name="ovgIngredients"/> Vaccines containing aluminium adjuvants cannot be frozen or allowed to freeze accidentally in a refrigerator, as this causes the particles to coagulate and damages the antigen.{{sfn|Garçon|Friede|2018|p=64}}

Another adjuvant used in some [[Influenza vaccine|flu vaccines]] is an oil-in-water emulsion. The oil, [[squalene]], is found in all plant and animal cells, and is commercially extracted and purified from [[Shark liver oil|shark liver]]. The flu vaccine for older adults, Fluad, uses an adjuvant branded [[MF59]], which has squalene (9.75 milligrams), [[citric acid]] (0.04 milligrams) and three [[emulsifier]]s: [[polysorbate 80]], [[sorbitan trioleate]], [[sodium citrate]] (1.175, 1.175 and 0.66 milligrams respectively).<ref name="emcFluad">{{cite web |title=Fluad, Suspension for injection in pre-filled syringe |url=https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/product/9223 |website=electronic medicines compendium |publisher=Datapharm |access-date=3 January 2021}}</ref> The [[Influenza A virus subtype H1N1|H1N1 swine-flu]] vaccine, [[Pandemrix]], used the adjuvant branded [[AS03]], which has squalene (10.69 milligrams), DL-α-tocopherol (11.86 milligrams) and polysorbate{{nbs}}80 (4.86 milligrams)<ref name="emaPandremix">{{cite web |title=Pandremix Product Information |url=https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/product-information/pandemrix-epar-product-information_en.pdf |website=European Medicines Agency |access-date=16 January 2021 |date=10 June 2016}}</ref>

===Preservatives===
Preservatives prevent the growth of bacteria and fungi, and are more commonly used in vaccines produced as multi-dose vials. They must also be non-toxic in the dose used and not adversely affect the [[immunogenicity]] of the vaccine.{{sfn|Finn|Egan|2018|p=75}} [[Thiomersal]] is the best known and most controversial preservative. It was phased out of UK vaccines between 2003 and 2005 and is not used in any routine vaccines in the UK. As a precaution, the US and Europe have also removed thiomersal from vaccines, despite there being no evidence of harm.<ref name="ovgIngredients"/> The US-licensed vaccines in the routine paediatric schedule generally have no thiomersal at all; a few have only a trace amount as a residual from manufacturing (less than one microgram). This is also the case for influenza vaccines in the US that come in single-dose vials or prefilled syringes. Some influenza vaccines are also available as a multi-dose vial, and in that form contain thiomersal (24.5 micrograms of mercury).{{sfn|Finn|Egan|2018|pp=76–77}}

[[Phenol]] 0.25% v/v is used in Pneumovax 23, a [[pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine]], and in the smallpox vaccine. However, phenol reduces the potency of diphtheria and tetanus toxoid-containing vaccines. Similarly, thiomersal weakens the immunogenicity of the inactivated poliovirus vaccine, so the IPOL vaccine contains 2–3 microlitres of [[Phenoxyethanol|2-phenoxyethanol]] instead.{{sfn|Finn|Egan|2018|p=76}}<ref name=sanofiIpol>{{cite web |title=IPOL Inactivated Poliomyelitis Vaccine |url=http://products.sanofi.com.au/vaccines/IPOL_NZ_PI.pdf |website=Sanofi Australia & New Zealand |access-date=13 February 2021}}</ref>

===Stabilisers===
Stabilisers protect the vaccine from the effects of temperature and ensure it does not degrade in storage. For vaccines that are freeze-dried, they provide a necessary bulk. Without them, the vaccine powder would be invisibly tiny (ranging from nanograms to a few tens of micrograms) and stick to the vial glass. Stabilisers used for vaccines include sugars ([[sucrose]], [[lactose]]), [[sorbitol]], amino acids ([[glycine]], [[monosodium glutamate]]) and proteins ([[hydrolysis|hydrolysed]] [[gelatin]]). There have very rarely (one in two{{nbs}}million vaccinations) been cases of allergic reaction to the proteins in gelatin.<ref name="ovgIngredients"/>{{sfn|Finn|Egan|2018|p=78–79}} The source of gelatin, pork, is of religious concern to Jewish and Muslim communities, though some leaders have ruled this is not a cause to reject vaccines that are injected or inhaled rather than ingested. There are alternatives for some vaccines that contain gelatine.<ref name="ovgIngredients"/><ref name=porcine>{{cite web |title=Vaccines and porcine gelatine |url=https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/933552/Vaccines_porcine_gelatine_2020_A4.pdf |publisher=Public Health England |access-date=13 February 2021 |date=2020}}</ref>

[[Acidity regulator]]s such as phosphate salts keep the pH within a required range during manufacture and in the final product. Other salts help ensure the vaccine is [[Tonicity|isotonic]] with body fluids.{{sfn|Finn|Egan|2018|p=80}}

===Manufacturing residuals===
There are materials that serve no function in the final vaccine but are left over from the manufacturing process. Bacteria and viruses may be inactivated using [[formaldehyde]]. The quantity remaining in diphtheria or tetanus toxoid vaccines licensed in the US is required to be less than 0.1 milligrams (0.02%). Although formaldehyde has potentially toxic and carcinogenic properties in large doses, it is present in the blood (due to natural biochemical processes) at much higher concentrations than permitted in vaccines. Alternatives used in some vaccines include [[glutaraldehyde]] and [[β-propiolactone]]. Antibiotics may be used to prevent bacteria growing during vaccine manufacture and traces of these may remain. Antibiotics that some people are allergic to (such as [[cephalosporin]]s, [[penicillin]]s and [[sulphonamide]]s) are not used. Those that are used include [[kanamycin]], [[gentamicin]], [[neomycin]], [[polymyxin B]], and [[streptomycin]].<ref name="ovgIngredients"/>{{sfn|Finn|Egan|2018|p=81}}

A small amounts of protein may remain from the material used to grow viruses, to which some people may be hypersensitive. Some influenza and yellow fever vaccines are grown in chicken eggs, and measles or mumps vaccines may be grown in chick embryo cell culture. Engerix-B, a [[DNA vaccine|recombinant DNA vaccine]] for [[Hepatitis B vaccine|hepatitis{{nbs}}B]] is produced in yeast and may contain up to five percent yeast protein.{{sfn|Finn|Egan|2018|p=81}} [[Cervarix]], an [[HPV vaccine]], is grown in a cell line from the [[cabbage looper]] moth.<ref name="emcCervarix">{{cite web |title=Cervarix suspension for injection in pre-filled syringe |url=https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/product/1177 |website=electronic medicines compendium |publisher=Datapharm |access-date=11 April 2021 |date=1 Jun 2020}}</ref> The amount of insect protein remaining is less than forty nanograms.{{sfn|Finn|Egan|2018|p=81}}

Some components of the vaccine vial or syringe may contain [[latex]] rubber. This is a problem for those with a [[Type I hypersensitivity|severe]] [[Latex allergy|allergic reaction to latex]], but not for those who get [[contact dermatitis]] after wearing latex gloves.<ref name="ovgIngredients"/>{{sfn|Finn|Egan|2018|p=82}}
