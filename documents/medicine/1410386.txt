{{nihongo|'''Kappo'''|活法|kappō|"resuscitation techniques"}} are healing techniques that often involve stimulation of specific [[acupuncture point]]s. Kappo is commonly used in [[martial arts]] such as [[Danzan Ryu]] and [[Judo]]. ''Kappo'' contains two [[kanji]]: ''katsu'' ([[wikt:活|活]] “resuscitation, life”) and ''ho'' ([[wikt:法 |法]] “method”).

More specifically, kappo refers to resuscitation techniques used to revive someone who has been [[chokehold|choked]] to the point of unconsciousness, to lessen the pain of a [[groin attack|strike to the groin]], to help unlock a seized [[thoracic diaphragm]], to stop a [[bleeding nose]], and other common training injuries.  These techniques, as practiced by the martial arts of [[Judo]] and [[Danzan Ryu]], can involve  striking specific points on the body, manual manipulation of the [[carotid triangle]] to open closed arteries, or manually opening and closing the lungs to allow air to flow in and out.  The manual manipulation of breathing, which has some similarities with [[rescue breathing]] and [[Cardiopulmonary resuscitation|CPR]], is called ''katsu''.

A tradition in some Judo schools involves teaching kappo to all new [[shodan (rank)|shodan]] (black belts).  This instruction is followed by a session where each of the shodan choke someone, are choked themselves, and resuscitate someone using kappo.
