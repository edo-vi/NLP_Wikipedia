'''''Stuck: How Vaccine Rumors Start and Why They Don't Go Away''''' (2020), published by [[Oxford University Press]] and written by the director of the [[London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine]]'s [[Vaccine Confidence Project]], [[Heidi Larson]], looks at what influences attitudes to [[vaccination]]. It was largely compiled before the [[COVID-19 pandemic]] and inspired by her feeling that the dialogue between scientists and the public regarding vaccines was becoming complex on a background of [[Information overload|increasing online information]].

Using historical examples, from 19th century protests against [[smallpox vaccination]] to 21st-century boycotts of [[polio vaccination]] programmes, to show how [[Misinformation related to vaccination|rumours about vaccinations]] spread, the book looks chiefly at [[World Bank high-income economy|high-income countries]] and examines the factors that form opinions about vaccination.

==Synopsis==
The book addresses [[misinformation related to vaccination]], and asks how vaccine rumors start and why they do not go away.<ref name="Gel2020"/><ref name="Vaug202"/> Looking chiefly at [[World Bank high-income economy|high-income countries]], the book examines social, political, psychological and cultural factors that make up the various mind-sets to vaccination.<ref name="Don2020"/> Larson also uses historical examples, from 19th century protests against [[smallpox vaccination]] to 21st-century boycotts of [[polio vaccination]] programmes, to show how rumours about vaccinations spread.<ref name="Don2020"/> She writes: "Digital media has certainly contributed to the social amplification of risk, but there is no single culprit in this wave of dissent."<ref name="Don2020"/>

Larson was inspired by her feeling that the dialogue between scientists and the public, regarding vaccines, was becoming complex, against a background of a [[Information overload|proliferation of online information]]. However, there is "opportunity for change", if vaccine experts can engage using [[social media]].<ref name="Das2020">{{cite journal |last1=Das |first1=Pamela |title=Heidi Larson: shifting the conversation about vaccine confidence |journal=The Lancet |date=26 September 2020 |volume=396 |issue=10255 |pages=877 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(20)31612-3 |pmid=32919523 |language=English |issn=0140-6736|doi-access=free }}</ref>

The book concludes with a call to social media companies to take responsibility for the part their technology plays in disseminating information pertaining to vaccines, because "for vaccine uptake to increase, the public must be inspired to protect one another".<ref name="Don2020"/>

==Reception==
Released during the COVID-19 pandemic, ''[[The Lancet]]'' stated that "at a time of increasing global uncertainty, Larson's values of respecting other people's views and engaging with them will be crucial".<ref name="Das2020"/> With the challenges of misinformation surrounding [[COVID-19 vaccine]]s, [[Joan Donovan]], writing in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', agreed with Larson's findings.<ref name="Don2020"/> The book was also reviewed in the ''[[New Scientist]]''.<ref name="Ham2021"/>
