  
'''Porcine epidemic diarrhea''' is a condition caused by the [[porcine epidemic diarrhea virus]] that leads to severe [[gastrointestinal disease]] in pigs.

It is closely related to the agent responsible for [[Transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus|transmissible gastroenteritis]] in pigs. Piglets are most susceptible to the disease, as are young adults during periods of stress. Transmission is via the [[fecal-oral route]].
__TOC__
==Signs and symptoms==
In adult swine, the disease is very mild and mortality is rare. The primary signs are a watery [[diarrhea]] and mild systemic signs such as [[pyrexia]], [[Anorexia (symptom)|anorexia]] and [[lethargy]].
==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis is via [[immunofluorescence]] or [[immunohistochemistry]], and [[ELISA]] can detect antigen or antibodies.

==Treatment and control==
Treatment is symptomatic and aims to prevent [[dehydration]] in young pigs, using products such as electrolyte and energy supplements. Good [[biosecurity]] protocols such as adequate quarantine, isolation of cases, and disinfection help prevent entry or spread of the disease in the herd.
