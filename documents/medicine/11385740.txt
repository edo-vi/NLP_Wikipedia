'''Eli Jones''' (1850–1933) was an American [[medical doctor]] who claimed to be able to treat [[cancer]]. 

== Life ==
Jones studied conventional medicine and practiced for five years before deciding that the medicine of the day was harmful, because of its dependence upon harsh [[cathartic]]s like [[calomel]].  He then turned to [[eclectic medicine]], which relied upon [[Herbalism|herbal]] extracts including those of the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]], went back to school, graduated, and practiced eclectic medicine for another five years.  He decided to learn [[homeopathy]], went back to school, and then practiced as a homeopath.  He next turned to [[Physiomedicalism]] and, after studying, practiced that for another five years.  And finally, he studied [[Wilhelm Heinrich Schüßler|Dr. Willhelm Heinrich Schüssler]]'s [[biochemical cell salts]], which is similar to homeopathy, but relies upon salts found in the body and practiced that.<ref name="naturalhealthdoc">{{cite web|url=http://homeopathy-homeopathics-remedies.naturalhealthdoc.net/Homeopathic-Remedy-Information/Schussler's-Biochemical-Method.htm |title=Dr. Schussler's Twelve Cell - Schussler's Biochemic Method Theory |author=Dr. Linda Hadley|publisher=homeopathy-homeopathics-remedies.naturalhealthdoc.net|accessdate=2016-04-15}}</ref>  After his forays into the various medical schools of his time, Jones developed a [[Syncretism|syncretic]] practice using all the schools he had learned.  He tended to use a low dosage herbal tinctures or homeopathic mother tinctures in high doses.  His ''Definite Medication'' proposed low dosage herbal extracts and engendered opposition from non-homeopaths.
