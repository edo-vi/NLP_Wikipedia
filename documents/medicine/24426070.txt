== History ==
Natural Standard Research Collaboration was founded in 2000 to serve as a clearing house for information on [[evidence-based medicine]] covering numerous healthcare disciplines. This international effort involves authors, editors, and peer reviewers from multiple academic and research institutions. It used an A thru F grading system.

Natural Standard was taken over by Therapeutic Research Center in 2013.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://info.therapeuticresearch.com/mergerpressrelease |title=Therapeutic Research Center acquires Natural Standard
|date=18 June 2013 |publisher=Therapeutic Research Center |accessdate=14 January 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://info.therapeuticresearch.com/our-history |title=Our history |publisher=Therapeutic Research Center |accessdate=14 January 2014}}</ref>

Natural Standard thru the new Therapeutic Research Center is a subscription-only database that delivers information about complementary and alternative medicine and dietary supplements and produces the Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database (NMCD). A new combined database will be called "Natural Medicines" (http://info.therapeuticresearch.com/natural-medicine-comprehensive-database). Natural Standard provides information that is broad in scope, and focused on both medications and disease states. A standout feature of this database is its graded, evidence-based evaluation of alternative therapies.<ref>{{ cite web |url= https://ala-choice.libguides.com/c.php?g=382356&p=2591024 | title=Online Drug Information Resources (June 2015): Natural Standard |date=26 Dec 2018}}</ref>
