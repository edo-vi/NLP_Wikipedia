{{Short description|Evolution of a pathogen allowing it to evade the host immune response}}
{{also|Variants of SARS-CoV-2}}
'''Antigenic escape''', '''immune escape''', '''immune evasion''' or '''escape mutation''' occurs when the [[immune system]] of a [[Host (biology)|host]], especially of a human being, is unable to respond to an [[Pathogen|infectious agent]]: the host's immune system is no longer able to recognize and eliminate a [[pathogen]], such as a [[virus]]. This process can occur in a number of different ways of both a genetic and an environmental nature.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|title = Anti-Tumor Immunity in Head and Neck Cancer: Understanding the Evidence, How Tumors Escape and Immunotherapeutic Approaches|last1 = Allen|first1 = Clint|date = 2015|journal = Cancers|doi = 10.3390/cancers7040900|pmid = 26690220|last2 = Clavijo|first2 = Paul|last3 = Waes|first3 = Carter|last4 = Chen|first4 = Zhong|pmc = 4695900|volume=7|issue = 4|pages=2397–414|doi-access = free}}</ref> Such mechanisms include [[homologous recombination]], and manipulation and resistance of the host's immune responses.<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal|title = Genetic Battle between Helicobacter pylori and humans.

Different [[antigen]]s are able to escape through a variety of mechanisms. For example, the African [[Trypanosoma|trypanosome]] parasites are able to clear the host's [[antibodies]], as well as resist [[lysis]] and inhibit parts of the [[innate immune response]].<ref name=":2">{{Cite journal|title = Escape Mechanisms of African Trypanosomes: Why Trypanosomosis Is Keeping Us Awake|last1 = Cnops|first1 = Jennifer|date = 2015|journal = Parasitology|doi = 10.1017/s0031182014001838 |last2 = Magez|first2 = Stefan|last3 = De Trez|first3 = Carl |volume=142 |issue = 3|pages=417–427|pmid = 25479093|s2cid = 9365261}}</ref> A bacteria, ''[[Bordetella pertussis]]'', is able to escape the immune response by inhibiting [[neutrophil]]s and [[macrophage]]s from invading the infection site early on.<ref name=":3">{{Cite journal|title = Host-Pathogen Interaction During Bacterial Vaccination|last1 = Barnett|first1 = Timothy|date = 2015|journal = Current Opinion in Immunology|doi = 10.1016/j.coi.2015.04.002|last2 = Lim|first2 = Jin|last3 = Soderholm|first3 = Amelia|last4 = Rivera-Hernandes|first4 = Tania|last5 = West|first5 = Nicholas|last6 = Walker|first6 = Mark |volume=36 |pages=1–7|pmid = 25966310}}</ref> One cause of antigenic escape is that a pathogen's [[epitope]]s (the binding sites for [[immune cell]]s) become too similar to a person's naturally occurring [[MHC class I|MHC-1]] epitopes, resulting in the immune system becoming unable to distinguish the infection from self-cells.

Antigenic escape is not only crucial for the host's natural immune response, but also for the resistance against [[vaccination]]s. The problem of antigenic escape has greatly deterred the process of creating new vaccines. Because vaccines generally cover a small ratio of strains of one virus, the recombination of antigenic DNA that lead to diverse pathogens allows these invaders to resist even newly developed vaccinations.<ref name=":4">{{Cite journal|title = Strategies for Designing and Monitoring Malaria Vaccines Targeting Diverse Antigens|last1 = Barry|first1 = Alyssa|date = 2014|journal = Frontiers in Immunology|doi = 10.3389/fimmu.2014.00359 |last2 = Arnott|first2 = Alicia|volume=5|page = 359|pmc = 4112938|pmid=25120545|doi-access = free}}</ref> Some antigens may even target pathways different from those the vaccine had originally intended to target.<ref name=":3" /> Recent research on many vaccines, including the [[malaria]] vaccine, has focused on how to anticipate this diversity and create vaccinations that can cover a broader spectrum of [[antigenic variation]].<ref name=":4" /> On 12 May 2021, scientists reported to [[United States Congress|The United States Congress]] of the continuing threat of [[Variants of SARS-CoV-2|COVID-19 variants]] and COVID-19 escape mutations, such as the [[E484K]] virus mutation.<ref name="NYT-20210512">{{cite news |last=Zimmer |first=Carl |authorlink=Carl Zimmer |title=Scientists warn U.S. lawmakers about the continued threat of coronavirus variants.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/12/science/covid-variant-mutation-tracking.html |date=12 May 2021 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=13 May 2021 }}</ref>

== Mechanisms of evasion ==

=== ''Helicobacter pylori'' and homologous recombination ===
The most common of antigenic escape mechanisms, [[homologous recombination]], can be seen in a wide variety of bacterial pathogens, including ''[[Helicobacter pylori]]'', a bacterium that infects the [[human stomach]]. While a host's homologous recombination can act as a defense mechanisms for fixing [[DNA repair#Double-strand breaks|DNA double stranded break]]s (DSBs), it can also create changes in antigenic DNA that can create new, unrecognizable proteins that allow the [[antigen]] to escape recognition by the host's immune response. Through the recombination of ''H. pylori's'' [[Membrane protein|outer membrane proteins]], [[immunoglobulins]] can no longer recognize these new structures and, therefore, cannot attack the antigen as part of the normal immune response.<ref name=":1" />

=== African trypanosomes ===
African [[trypanosomes]] are [[parasite]]s that are able to escape the immune responses of its host animal through a range of mechanisms. Its most prevalent mechanism is its ability to evade recognition by antibodies through [[antigenic variation]]. This is achieved through the switching of its [[variant surface glycoprotein]] or VSG, a substance that coats the entire antigen. When this coat is recognized by an antibody, the parasite can be eliminated. However, variation of this coat can lead to antibodies being unable to recognize and eliminate the antigen. In addition to this, the VSG coat is able to clear the antibodies themselves to escape their clearing function.{{cn|date=March 2021}}{{clarify|date=March 2021}}

Trypanosomes are also able to achieve evasion through the mediation of the host's immune response. Through the conversion of [[adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] to [[cyclic AMP|cAMP]] by the enzyme [[adenylate cyclase]], the production of [[TNF-α]], a signaling [[cytokine]] important for inducing inflammation, is inhibited in [[liver]] [[myeloid cells]]. In addition, trypanosomes are able to weaken the immune system by inducing [[B cell]] [[apoptosis]] (cell death) and the degradation of B cell [[lymphopoiesis]]. They are also able to induce suppressor molecules that can inhibit [[T cell]] reproduction.<ref name=":2" />

=== Plant RNA viruses ===
Lafforgue et al 2011 found escape mutants in [[plant RNA virus]]es to be encouraged by coexistence of [[transgenic crop]]s with [[artificial microRNA|artificial microRNA (amiR)]]-based resistance with fully susceptible individuals of the same crop, and even more so by coexistence with weakly amiR-producing transgenics.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Lafforgue |first1=Guillaume |display-authors=etal|title=Tempo and Mode of Plant RNA Virus Escape from RNA Interference-Mediated Resistance |journal=Journal of Virology |date=9 September 2011 |volume=85 |issue=19 |pages=9686–9695 |doi=10.1128/JVI.05326-11 |pmid=21775453 |pmc=3196453 }}</ref><ref name="Bedhomme-et-al-2015">{{cite journal | last1=Bedhomme | first1=Stéphanie | last2=Hillung | first2=Julia | last3=Elena | first3=Santiago F | title=Emerging viruses: why they are not jacks of all trades? | journal=[[Current Opinion in Virology]] | publisher=[[Elsevier]] | volume=10 | year=2015 | issn=1879-6257 | doi=10.1016/j.coviro.2014.10.006 | pages=1–6 | s2cid=28445949 | pmid=25467278| hdl=10261/108773 | hdl-access=free }}</ref><ref name="Duffy-2018">{{cite journal | last=Duffy | first=Siobain | title=Why are RNA virus mutation rates so damn high? | journal=[[PLOS Biology]] | publisher=[[Public Library of Science]] | volume=16 | issue=8 | date=2018-08-13 | issn=1545-7885 | doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.3000003 | page=e3000003 | pmid=30102691 | pmc=6107253 | s2cid=51978497}}</ref><ref name="Elena-et-al-2014">{{cite book | last1=Elena | first1=Santiago F. | last2=Fraile | first2=Aurora | last3=García-Arenal | first3=Fernando | title=[[Advances in Virus Research]] | chapter=3 - Evolution and Emergence of Plant Viruses | publisher=[[Elsevier]] | year=2014 | volume=88 | issn=0065-3527 | isbn=978-0-12-800098-4 | pages=161–191 | doi=10.1016/B978-0-12-800098-4.00003-9 | s2cid=43840370 | pmid=24373312| hdl=10251/58029 }}</ref>

=== Tumor escape ===
Many [[head and neck cancer]]s are able to escape immune responses in a variety of ways. One such example is through the production of pro-inflammatory and [[immunosuppressive]] cytokines. This can be achieved when the tumor recruits immunosuppressive cell subsets into the tumor's environment. Such cells include pro-tumor M2 macrophages, [[myeloid-derived suppressor cell]]s (MDSCs), Th-2 polarized [[T helper cell|CD4 T-lymphocytes]], and [[regulatory T cell|regulatory T-lymphocyte]]s. These cells can then limit the responses of T cells through the production of cytokines and by releasing immune-modulating [[enzyme]]s.<ref name=":0" />  Additionally tumors can escape antigen-directed therapies by loss or down-regulation of the associated antigens, as well demonstrated after checkpoint blockade immunotherapy<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Zaretsky|first1=Jesse M.|last2=Garcia-Diaz|first2=Angel|last3=Shin|first3=Daniel S.|last4=Escuin-Ordinas|first4=Helena|last5=Hugo|first5=Willy|last6=Hu-Lieskovan|first6=Siwen|last7=Torrejon|first7=Davis Y.|last8=Abril-Rodriguez|first8=Gabriel|last9=Sandoval|first9=Salemiz|last10=Barthly|first10=Lucas|last11=Saco|first11=Justin|date=2016-09-01|title=Mutations Associated with Acquired Resistance to PD-1 Blockade in Melanoma|journal=The New England Journal of Medicine|volume=375|issue=9|pages=819–829|doi=10.1056/NEJMoa1604958|issn=1533-4406|pmc=5007206|pmid=27433843}}</ref> and CAR-T cell therapy<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Majzner|first1=Robbie G.|last2=Mackall|first2=Crystal L.|date=2018-10-01|title=Tumor Antigen Escape from CAR T-cell Therapy|url=https://cancerdiscovery.aacrjournals.org/content/8/10/1219|journal=Cancer Discovery|language=en|volume=8|issue=10|pages=1219–1226|doi=10.1158/2159-8290.CD-18-0442|issn=2159-8274|pmid=30135176|doi-access=free}}</ref> though more recent data indicate that this may be prevented by localized bystander killing mediated by fasL/fas.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Upadhyay|first1=Ranjan|last2=Boiarsky|first2=Jonathan A.|last3=Pantsulaia|first3=Gvantsa|last4=Svensson-Arvelund|first4=Judit|last5=Lin|first5=Matthew J.|last6=Wroblewska|first6=Aleksandra|last7=Bhalla|first7=Sherry|last8=Scholler|first8=Nathalie|last9=Bot|first9=Adrian|last10=Rossi|first10=John M.|last11=Sadek|first11=Norah|date=2020-01-01|title=A critical role for fas-mediated off-target tumor killing in T cell immunotherapy|journal=Cancer Discovery|volume=11|issue=3|pages=599–613|language=en|doi=10.1158/2159-8290.CD-20-0756|issn=2159-8274|pmid=33334730|pmc=7933082|doi-access=free}}</ref>  Alternatively therapies can be developed to encompass multiple antigens in parallel.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Shah|first1=Nirav N.|last2=Johnson|first2=Bryon D.|last3=Schneider|first3=Dina|last4=Zhu|first4=Fenlu|last5=Szabo|first5=Aniko|last6=Keever-Taylor|first6=Carolyn A.|last7=Krueger|first7=Winfried|last8=Worden|first8=Andrew A.|last9=Kadan|first9=Michael J.|last10=Yim|first10=Sharon|last11=Cunningham|first11=Ashley|date=October 2020|title=Bispecific anti-CD20, anti-CD19 CAR T cells for relapsed B cell malignancies: a phase 1 dose escalation and expansion trial|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-1081-3|journal=Nature Medicine|language=en|volume=26|issue=10|pages=1569–1575|doi=10.1038/s41591-020-1081-3|pmid=33020647|s2cid=222159001|issn=1546-170X}}</ref>

== Escape from vaccination ==

=== Consequences of recent vaccines ===
While vaccines are created to strengthen the immune response to [[pathogen]]s, in many cases these vaccines are not able to cover the wide variety of strains a pathogen may have. Instead they may only protect against one or two strains, leading to the escape of strains not covered by the vaccine.<ref name=":4" /> This results in the pathogens being able to attack targets of the immune system different than those intended to be targeted by the vaccination.<ref name=":3" /> This parasitic antigen diversity is particularly troublesome for the development of the [[malaria vaccine]]s.<ref name=":4" />

=== Solutions to escape of vaccination ===
In order to fix this problem, vaccines must be able to cover the wide variety of strains within a bacterial population. In recent research of ''[[Neisseria meningitidis]]'', the possibility of such broad coverage may be achieved through the combination of multi-component [[polysaccharide]] conjugate vaccines. However, in order to further improve upon broadening the scope of vaccinations, epidemiological surveillance must be conducted to better detect the variation of escape mutants and their spread.<ref name=":3" />
