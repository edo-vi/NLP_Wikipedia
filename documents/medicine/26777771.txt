'''Olbas Oil''' is a remedy, of Swiss origin, for congestion in the chest and nose, some hayfever relief (in certain cases) and also for muscle ache via massage. It is made from a mixture of several different essential oils and has been marketed since before 1916. The name is a contraction of ''Oleum Basileum'', "oil from [[Basel]]".

==Risk of eye injury==
Olbas Oil's packaging is similar to that of [[eye drops]], with the result that people occasionally administer it onto their eyes in error, causing injury.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Adams MK, Sparrow JM, Jim S, Tole DM | title = Inadvertent administration of Olbas oil into the eye: a surprisingly frequent presentation | journal = Eye | volume = 23 | issue = 1 | pages = 244 | date = January 2009 | pmid = 18404161 | doi = 10.1038/eye.2008.70 | doi-access = free }}</ref>
