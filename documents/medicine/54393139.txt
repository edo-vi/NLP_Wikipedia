The [[UNICEF]] and [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) executive directors stated: "This deadly cholera outbreak is the direct consequence of two years of heavy conflict. Collapsing health, water and sanitation systems have cut off 14.5 million people from regular access to clean water and sanitation, increasing the ability of the disease to spread. Rising rates of malnutrition have weakened children's health and made them more vulnerable to disease. An estimated 30,000 dedicated local health workers who play the largest role in ending this outbreak have not been paid their salaries for nearly ten months."<ref name=WHO_UNICEF/>

By October 2018, there were more than 1.2&nbsp;million cases reported, and more than 2,500 people—58% children—have died in the Yemen cholera outbreak, which is the worst epidemic in recorded history and was, according to the [[United Nations]] (UN), the worst humanitarian crisis in the world.<ref name= Federspiel/>  Between 1 January 2018 to 31 May 2020, the cumulative total number of suspected cases was 1,371,819 with 1566 associated deaths.<ref name=":8" /> The case fatality rate for the outbreak was 0.11% as of 2020,<ref name=":8" /> having declined from a high of 1% when the outbreak first began.<ref name=Guardian12October/>

==Causes and challenges==
UNICEF and the WHO attributed the outbreak to [[malnutrition]], collapsing sanitation and clean water systems due to the country's ongoing conflict, and the approximately 30,000 local health care workers who had not been paid for almost a year.<ref name=WHO_UNICEF>{{cite press release|title=Statement from UNICEF Executive Director Anthony Lake and WHO Director-General Margaret Chan on the cholera outbreak in Yemen as suspected cases exceed 200,000|url=https://www.unicef.org/media/media_96544.html|publisher=UNICEF|access-date=26 June 2017|date= 24 June 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170702063819/https://www.unicef.org/media/media_96544.html|archive-date=2 July 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> These factors resulted in a delayed vaccination program, which was not started until more than one million people were already ill.<ref name= Federspiel>{{cite journal | vauthors = Federspiel F, Ali M | title = The cholera outbreak in Yemen: lessons learned and way forward | journal = BMC Public Health | volume = 18 | issue = 1 | pages = 1338 | date = December 2018 | pmid = 30514336 | pmc = 6278080 | doi = 10.1186/s12889-018-6227-6 | type = Review }}</ref>

===Pre-civil war conditions===
Even before civil war affected Yemen, it was "beset by circumstances that made it ripe for cholera".<ref name="Qadri" /> A country with high poverty rates, Yemen also suffered frequent droughts and severe water access problems, with only about half of the population having had access to good [[WASH|water and sanitation]] before the war.<ref name= Qadri/>

Children under five showed a high prevalence of malnutrition, making them further susceptible to disease;<ref name=Federspiel/> Yemen had "one of the highest rates of childhood malnutrition worldwide".<ref name= Raslan/> The health care system in Yemen before the conflict was weak and lacking infrastructure.<ref name= Raslan/> For instance, before the war, 70–80% of children were vaccinated against measles, but the vaccination rate had dropped by the end of 2015.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Qirbi N, Ismail SA | title = Ongoing threat of a large-scale measles outbreak in Yemen | journal = The Lancet.

===Ongoing conflict===
Because of the ongoing conflict in Yemen, and resulting displacement of people who do not have adequate food, waster, housing or sanitation, pre-existing conditions were exacerbated.

Federspiel and Ali write in ''[[BioMed Central|BMC Public Health]]'':{{blockquote|OCVs were not delivered until nearly 3.5 years into this humanitarian emergency, which has most likely been due to ongoing conflict, logistical circumstances, the scale of the epidemic, impairment of the humanitarian response by the parts to the conflict and some degree of negligence from donors, politicians and other decision makers. Whatever the reasons, OCVs were not distributed until nearly 16 months into the cholera outbreak by which time more than a million cases had accumulated. Neither were they in the two years of WaSH infrastructure breakdown that preceded the outbreak. This should serve as a historic example of the failure to control the spread of cholera given the tools that are available.
