{{Short description|Lethal epizootic disease of farmed shrimp}}
'''Necrotising hepatopancreatitis''' (NHP), is also known as Texas necrotizing hepatopancreatitis (TNHP), Texas Pond Mortality Syndrome (TPMS) and Peru necrotizing hepatopancreatitis (PNHP),<ref name="AAPQIS"/> is a lethal [[epizootic]] disease of [[shrimp farm|farmed shrimp]]. It is not very well researched yet, but generally assumed to be caused by a [[bacterium|bacterial]] infection.

NHP mainly affects the farmed shrimp species ''[[Whiteleg shrimp|Litopenaeus vannamei]]'' (Pacific white shrimp) and ''[[Litopenaeus stylirostris]]'' (Western blue shrimp), but has also been reported in three other American species, namely ''[[Farfantepenaeus aztecus]]'', ''[[Farfantepenaeus californiensis]]'', and ''[[Litopenaeus setiferus]]''.<ref name="Bondad">{{cite book |editor1=Melba G. Bondad-Reantaso |editor2=S. E. McGladdery |editor3=I. East |editor4=R. P. Subasinghe |title=Asia Diagnostic Guide to Aquatic Animal Diseases |url=http://library.enaca.org/NACA-Publications/ADG-CrustaceanDiseases.pdf |chapter=Chapter 4 |series=FAO Fisheries Technical Paper 402/2, NACA/FAO 2001 |isbn=92-5-104620-4}}</ref> The highest mortality rates occur in ''L. vannamei'', which is one of the two most frequently farmed species of shrimp. Untreated, the disease causes mortality rates of up to 90 percent within 30 days. A first outbreak of NHP had been reported in [[Texas]] in 1985; the disease then spread to shrimp [[aquaculture]]s in [[South America]].<ref name="Bondad"/>

NHP is associated with a small, [[gram-negative]], and highly [[pleomorphism (microbiology)|pleomorphic]] ''[[Rickettsia]]''-like bacterium that belongs to its own, new [[genus]] in the class [[Alphaproteobacteria]].<ref name="AAPQIS">{{cite web|url=http://library.enaca.org/NACA-Publications/ADG-CrustaceanDiseases.pdf|title=Asia Diagnostic Guide to Aquatic Animal Diseases|editor=Melba G.

The aetiological agent is the pathogenic agent Candidatus ''Hepatobacter penaei'', an obligate intracellular bacterium of the Order α-Proteobacteria.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.oie.int/index.php?id=2439&L=0&htmfile=chapitre_necrotising_hepatopancreatitis.htm|title=Access online: Manual of Diagnostic Tests for Aquatic Animals - OIE - World Organisation for Animal Health|website=www.oie.int|language=en|access-date=2017-09-07}}</ref>

Infected shrimps show gross signs including soft shells and flaccid bodies, black or darkened [[gill]]s, dark edges of the [[pleopod]]s, and [[uropod]]s, and an [[atrophy|atrophied]] [[hepatopancreas]] that is whitish instead of orange or tan as is usual.<ref>{{cite web |author=S.

The [[pathogen]] that causes NHP seems to prefer high water temperatures (above {{convert|29|C|F|disp=or}}) and elevated levels of salinity (more than 20–38&nbsp;[[Parts per thousand|ppt]]). Avoiding such conditions in shrimp ponds is thus an important disease control measure.<ref>{{cite book |editor=Donald V.
