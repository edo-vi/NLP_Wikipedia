'''Tibial dyschondroplasia''' ('''TD''') is a [[metabolic disease]] of young [[poultry]] that affects the growth of [[bone]] and [[cartilage]]. 
Often occurs in broilers (chickens raised for meat) and other poultry which have been bred for fast growth rates. The tibial cartilage does not mature enough to [[ossify]] (turn into bone). This leaves the [[growth plate]] prone to fracture, infection, and deformed bone development.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.poultrydvm.com/condition/tibial-dyschondroplasia |title=Tibial Dyschondroplasia |work=PoultryDMV |publisher=AnimalDMV LLC |accessdate=2021-03-31 }}</ref>

It is the leading cause of lameness, mortality, and carcass condemnations in commercial poultry.<ref>{{cite book|last=Turner|first=Jackie|title=THE WELFARE OF BROILER CHICKENS IN THE EUROPEAN UNION|year=2005|publisher=Compassion in World Farming Trust|location=UK|isbn=1-900156-35-0|pages=35}}</ref>
