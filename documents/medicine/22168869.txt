'''Melafix''' is a brand of [[Fish medicine|aquarium medicine]] made by [[Mars Fishcare]], marketed as a [[natural remedy]] for [[bacterial infections]], made from [[cajeput oil]].<ref name="EPM">{{Cite journal|last1=Shivappa|first1=Raghunath B.|last2=Christian|first2=Larry S.|last3=Noga|first3=Edward J.|last4=Law|first4=Jerry M.|last5=Lewbart|first5=Gregory A.|date=2015-04-01|title=Laboratory Evaluation of Safety and Efficacy for Melafix (Melaleuca cajuputi Extract)|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1557506315000269|journal=Journal of Exotic Pet Medicine|series=Backyard Poultry|language=en|volume=24|issue=2|pages=188–192|doi=10.1053/j.jepm.2015.04.020|issn=1557-5063}}</ref><ref name="DAO">{{Cite journal|last1=Schelkle|first1=Bettina|last2=Snellgrove|first2=Donna|last3=Jones|first3=Lewis L.|last4=Cable|first4=Jo|date=2015-07-23|title=Efficacy of commercially available products against ''Gyrodactylus turnbulli'' infections on guppies ''Poecilia reticulata''|url=https://www.int-res.com/abstracts/dao/v115/n2/p129-137/|journal=Diseases of Aquatic Organisms|language=en|volume=115|issue=2|pages=129–137|doi=10.3354/dao02886|pmid=26203884 |issn=0177-5103}}</ref>

== Uses ==
Melafix is used by hobby [[fishkeeping|fishkeepers]] to treat and prevent bacterial [[fish disease]], including [[fin rot]] and [[cottonmouth disease]].<ref>{{Cite web|first=Lindsey|last=Stanton|date=2021-03-26|title=How To Use Melafix & Does It Work?|url=https://www.itsafishthing.com/how-to-use-melafix/|access-date=2022-01-11|website=It's A Fish Thing|language=en-US}}</ref><ref name="Animals">{{Cite journal|last1=Rácz|first1=Anita|last2=Allan|first2=Brooke|last3=Dwyer|first3=Toni|last4=Thambithurai|first4=Davide|last5=Crespel|first5=Amélie|last6=Killen|first6=Shaun S.|date=2021-02-26|title=Identification of Individual Zebrafish (Danio rerio): A Refined Protocol for VIE Tagging Whilst Considering Animal Welfare and the Principles of the 3Rs|journal=Animals|volume=11|issue=3|pages=616|doi=10.3390/ani11030616|issn=2076-2615|pmc=7996851|pmid=33652779|doi-access=free }}</ref> It is an option for those who prefer to use natural remedies on their tank.<ref>{{Cite magazine|title=Is There a Doctor in the Tank?|url=https://www.petage.com/is-there-a-doctor-in-the-tank/|access-date=2022-01-11|magazine=Pet Age|language=en|first=Joe|last=Olenik|date=2015-10-12}}</ref> However, among [[aquarist]]s, its usefulness is debated on the basis of its efficacy and potential harm to [[anabantoid]] fish such as ''[[Betta splendens]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|first=Bob|last=Fenner|title=Choose Your Weapon: Freshwater Fish Disease Treatment Options|url=http://www.wetwebmedia.com/FWSubWebIndex/fwfishmeds.htm|access-date=2022-01-11|website=www.wetwebmedia.com}}</ref><ref name="Bettafix1">{{Cite web|first=Sean|last=B.|date=2021-07-01|title=Bettafix and Melafix - 5 Differences You Should Know|url=https://theaquariumadviser.com/bettafix-and-melafix/|access-date=2022-01-11|website=The Aquarium Adviser|language=en-us}}</ref>

It is also sometimes used in laboratory settings involving fish. In an effort to improve [[animal welfare]] of studied fish, Rácz ''et al.'' refined a protocol for the [[Animal identification#Fish|tagging]] of [[zebrafish]] (an important [[model organism]]) which includes the use of Melafix as a post-procedure antiseptic.<ref name="Animals"/>

The product is on the list of approved treatments for fish during mandatory quarantine after being imported to Australia.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Approved aquarium chemicals, treatments and antibiotics - DAWE|url=https://www.awe.gov.au/biosecurity-trade/import/goods/live-animals/importing-live-fish-aus/approved-treatments|access-date=2022-01-11|website=www.awe.gov.au}}</ref>

== Safety and efficacy ==
A 2015 study on Melafix found it had no antibacterial properties against several common fish pathogens, and suggested that reports of success with the product from hobbyists might point to [[immunostimulant]] properties instead. It also concluded that the product had no harmful impact on either [[goldfish]] or [[common clownfish]].<ref name="EPM"/>

Another study the same year tested its efficacy against the common [[guppy]] parasite, ''[[Gyrodactylus turnbulli]]''. An ''[[in vitro]]'' experiment found that Melafix, as well as the cajeput oil and an emulsifier used in the product tested separately, were as effective against the parasite as the [[antihelminthic]] drug [[Levamisole]]. An ''[[in vivo]]'' experiment found Melafix highly effective against the parasite when used in combination with another product from the company, [[Pimafix]]. However, neither product was significantly different than the control on its own.<ref name="DAO"/>
