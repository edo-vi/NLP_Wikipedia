<!-- Defining the topic and describing the current effort to achieve eradication. -->
'''Polio eradication''', the permanent global cessation of circulation of the [[poliovirus]] and hence elimination of the [[polio]]myelitis (polio) it causes, is the aim of a multinational [[public health]] effort begun in 1988, led by the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), the [[UNICEF|United Nations Children's Fund]] (UNICEF) and the [[Rotary Foundation]].<ref>{{Cite web|title = Polio Eradication |url = http://www.globalhealthstrategies.com/issues/polio-eradication|website = Global Health Strategies |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160308153348/http://globalhealthstrategies.com/issues/polio-eradication |archive-date=8 March 2016 |access-date = 11 February 2016|url-status=dead }}</ref> These organizations, along with the U.S. [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) and [[The Gates Foundation]], have spearheaded the campaign through the [[Global Polio Eradication Initiative]] (GPEI).

<!-- The means by which eradication is attempted (i.e. vaccination). -->
Prevention of disease spread is accomplished by vaccination. There are two kinds of [[polio vaccine]]—oral polio vaccine (OPV), which uses [[Attenuated vaccine|weakened poliovirus]], and [[Inactivated vaccine|inactivated]] polio vaccine (IPV), which is injected. OPV is less expensive and easier to administer, and can spread immunity beyond the person vaccinated, creating [[contact immunity]]. It has been the predominant vaccine used. However, under conditions of long-term vaccine virus circulation in under-vaccinated populations, mutations can reactivate the virus to produce a polio-inducing strain, while OPV can also, in rare circumstances, induce polio or persistent asymptomatic infection in vaccinated individuals, particularly those who are [[immunodeficient]]. Being inactivated, IPV is free of these risks but does not induce contact immunity. IPV is more costly and the logistics of delivery are more challenging.

<!-- Continuing cases -->
Recent polio cases arise from two sources, the original '[[Wild type|wild]]' poliovirus (WPV), and the much more prevalent mutated oral vaccine strains, known as circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV). Vaccines against each of the three wild strains of polio have given rise to strains of cVDPV, with cVDPV2 being most prominent. cVDPV caused 864 confirmed paralytic polio cases worldwide in 2022.

There were 30 confirmed WPV cases in 2022, a decrease from 2019's 5-year high of 176, a {{Percentage|{{#expr:719-30}}|719|1}} reduction from the 719 diagnosed cases in 2000 and a {{Percentage|{{#expr:35251-30}}|35251|2}} reduction from the 35,251 reported cases when the eradication effort began in 1988. Total polio cases (combined wild and circulating vaccine-derived) have dropped {{Percentage|{{#expr:35251-894}}|35251|1}} from 35,251 (reported) in 1988 to 894 (confirmed) in 2022. Of the three strains of WPV, the last recorded wild case caused by type{{nbsp}}2 (WPV2) was in 1999, and WPV2 was declared eradicated in 2015. Type{{nbsp}}3 (WPV3) is last known to have caused polio in 2012, and was declared eradicated in 2019.<ref name="polioeradication.org">{{Cite web|url=http://polioeradication.org/news-post/two-out-of-three-wild-poliovirus-strains-eradicated/|title=GPEI-Two out of three wild poliovirus strains eradicated|access-date=2 November 2019|archive-date=7 November 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191107080405/http://polioeradication.org/news-post/two-out-of-three-wild-poliovirus-strains-eradicated/|url-status=dead}}</ref> All wild-virus cases since that date have been due to type{{nbsp}}1 (WPV1).

In theory, if the right tools were available, it would be possible to eradicate all infectious diseases that reside only in a human host. In reality, there are distinct biological features of the organisms and technical factors of dealing with them that make their potential eradicability more or less likely. Three indicators, however, are considered of primary importance in determining the likelihood of successful eradication: that effective interventional tools are available to interrupt transmission of the agent, such as a [[vaccine]]; that diagnostic tools, with sufficient sensitivity and [[specificity (statistics)|specificity]], be available to detect infections that can lead to transmission of the disease; and that humans are required for the life-cycle of the agent, which has no other [[vertebrate]] [[Natural reservoir|reservoir]] and cannot amplify in the environment.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=((Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)) |title=Global Disease Elimination and Eradication as Public Health Strategies.

=== Strategy ===
The most important step in eradication of polio is interruption of [[:wiktionary:endemic|endemic]] [[Transmission (medicine)|transmission]] of poliovirus. Stopping polio transmission has been pursued through a combination of routine [[immunization]], supplementary immunization campaigns and surveillance of possible outbreaks. Several key strategies have been outlined for stopping polio transmission:<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = ((Global Polio Eradication Initiative)), ((World Health Organization)) | title = Global polio eradication initiative: strategic plan 2004–2008 | publisher = [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) | year = 2003 | location = Geneva | url = http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/42850/1/924159117X.pdf | isbn = 978-92-4-159117-1 | hdl = 10665/42850 | access-date = 26 October 2019 | archive-date = 20 August 2017 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170820152532/http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/42850/1/924159117X.pdf | url-status = live }}</ref>

# High infant immunization coverage with four doses of oral [[polio vaccine]] (OPV) in the first year of life in developing and endemic countries, and routine immunization with OPV or IPV elsewhere.
# Organization of "national immunization days" to provide supplementary doses of oral polio vaccine to all children less than five years old.
# Active surveillance for poliovirus through reporting and laboratory testing of all cases of acute flaccid paralysis. Acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) is a clinical manifestation of poliomyelitis characterized by weakness or [[paralysis]] and reduced [[muscle tone]] without other obvious cause (e.g., [[Physical trauma|trauma]]) among children less than fifteen years old. Other pathogenic agents can also cause AFP, such as [[enterovirus]]es, [[echovirus]]es, and [[adenovirus]]es.<ref>{{cite web | title = Acute Flaccid Paralysis (AFP) | work = Public Health Notifiable Disease Management Guidelines | publisher = Alberta Government Health and Wellness | year = 2018 | url = https://open.alberta.ca/publications/acute-flaccid-paralysis-afp | access-date = 28 October 2019 | archive-date = 28 October 2019 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20191028190537/https://open.alberta.ca/publications/acute-flaccid-paralysis-afp | url-status = live }}</ref>
# Expanded environmental surveillance to detect the presence of poliovirus in communities.<ref name="surveillance">{{cite report |vauthors=((Global Polio Eradication Initiative)), ((World Health Organization)) |title=Polio environmental surveillance expansion plan: global expansion plan under the endgame strategy 2013-2018 |publisher=[[World Health Organization]] (WHO) |date=April 2015 |access-date=1 July 2018 |url=http://polioeradication.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/GPLN_ExpansionPlanES.pdf |hdl=10665/276245 |id=WHO/POLIO/15.02 |archive-date=20 June 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170620180847/http://polioeradication.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/GPLN_ExpansionPlanES.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref> Sewage samples are collected at regular and random sites and tested in laboratories for the presence of WPV or cVDPV. Since most polio infections are asymptomatic, transmission can occur in spite of the absence of polio-related AFP cases, and such monitoring helps to evaluate the degree to which virus continues to circulate in an area.
# Targeted "mop-up" campaigns once poliovirus transmission is limited to specific geographical foci.

=== Vaccination ===
[[File:Somali boy receives a polio vaccination.jpg|thumb|Somali boy receiving injection of inactivated polio vaccine (IPV)]]
There are two distinct types of [[polio vaccine]]. Oral polio vaccine (OPV, or [[Albert Sabin|Sabin]] vaccine) contains [[attenuated vaccine|attenuated]] poliovirus. Attenuated poliovirus is 10,000 times less able than wild poliovirus to enter the bloodstream and cause polio.<ref name="GPEI-OPV">

OPV is delivered as oral drops or infused into sugar cubes.

The inactivated polio vaccine (IPV, or [[Jonas Salk|Salk]]) contains trivalent fully inactivated virus, administered by injection. This vaccine cannot induce VAPP nor do cVDPV strains arise from it, but it likewise cannot induce contact immunity and thus must be administered to every individual. Added to this are greater logistical challenges. Though a single dose is sufficient for protection, administration requires medically trained vaccinators armed with single-use needles and syringes.

==== Herd immunity ====
Polio vaccination is also important in the development of [[herd immunity]].<ref name= Fine>{{cite journal |author=Fine P |url=https://op12no2.me/stuff/herdhis.pdf |title=Herd immunity: history, theory, practice |journal=Epidemiol Rev |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=265–302 |year=1993 |pmid=8174658 |doi=10.1093/oxfordjournals.epirev.a036121 |access-date=27 August 2020 |archive-date=9 July 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200709224214/https://op12no2.me/stuff/herdhis.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref> For polio to occur in a population, there must be an infecting organism ([[poliovirus]]), a susceptible human population, and a cycle of [[Transmission (medicine)|transmission]]. Poliovirus is transmitted only through person-to-person contact, and the transmission cycle of polio is from one infected person to another person susceptible to the disease.<ref name= Nathan/> If the vast majority of the population is immune to a particular agent, the ability of that [[pathogen]] to infect another host is reduced; the cycle of transmission is interrupted, and the pathogen cannot reproduce and dies out. This concept, called community immunity or herd immunity, is important to disease eradication, because it means that it is not necessary to inoculate 100% of the population—a goal that is often logistically very difficult—to achieve the desired result. If the number of susceptible individuals can be reduced to a sufficiently small number through [[vaccination]], then the pathogen will eventually die off.<ref>{{Cite journal|vauthors=Shaw L, Spears W, Billings L, Maxim P |date=October 2010|title=Effective Vaccination Policies|journal=Information Sciences|volume=180|issue=19|pages=3728–3744|doi=10.1016/j.ins.2010.06.005|issn=0020-0255|pmc=2967767|pmid=21057602}}</ref>

When many hosts are vaccinated, especially simultaneously, the transmission of wild virus is blocked, and the virus is unable to find another susceptible individual to infect. Because poliovirus can only survive for a short time in the environment (a few weeks at room temperature, and a few months at 0–8&nbsp;°C (32–46&nbsp;°F)), without a human host, the virus dies out.<ref name=Minor_1990>{{cite book |vauthors=Minor PD, Bel EJ | title = Picornaviridae (excluding Rhinovirus).

Herd immunity is an important supplement to vaccination.

While vaccination has played an instrumental role in the reduction of polio cases worldwide, the use of attenuated virus in the oral vaccine carries with it an inherent risk. The oral vaccine is a powerful tool in fighting polio in part because of its person-to-person transmission and resulting contact immunity. However, under conditions of long-term circulation in undervaccinated populations, the virus can accumulate mutations that reverse the attenuation and result in vaccine virus strains that themselves cause polio. As a result of such circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV) strains, polio outbreaks have periodically recurred in regions that have long been free of the wild virus, but where vaccination rates have fallen. Oral vaccines can also give rise to persistent infection in immunodeficient individuals, with the virus eventually mutating into a more virulent immunodeficiency-associated vaccine-derived poliovirus (iVDPV). In particular, the type{{nbsp}}2 strain seems prone to reversions, so in 2016 the eradication effort abandoned the trivalent oral vaccine containing attenuated strains of all three virus types and replaced it with a bivalent oral vaccine lacking the type{{nbsp}}2 virus, while a separate monovalent type{{nbsp}}2 vaccine (mOPV2) was to be used only to target existing cVDPV2 outbreaks. Further, a novel oral vaccine targeting type{{nbsp}}2 (nOPV2) that has been genetically stabilized to make it less prone to give rise to circulating vaccine-derived strains is now in limited use.<ref>{{cite web| title=nOPV2| publisher=Global Polio Eradication Initiative| access-date=26 August 2020| url=http://polioeradication.org/nopv2/| archive-date=27 August 2020| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200827134956/http://polioeradication.org/nopv2/| url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=nOPV2release /> Eradication efforts will eventually require all oral vaccination to be discontinued in favor of the use of injectable vaccines. These vaccines are more expensive and more difficult to deliver, and they lack the ability to induce contact immunity because they contain only killed virus, but they likewise are incapable of giving rise to vaccine-derived viral strains.<ref>{{cite web|title=Vaccine-Derived Poliovirus|publisher=[[Global Polio Eradication Initiative]] (GPEI)|access-date=26 June 2018|url=http://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-prevention/the-virus/vaccine-derived-polio-viruses/|archive-date=26 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180626025107/http://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-prevention/the-virus/vaccine-derived-polio-viruses/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Duintjer Tebbens | first1=Duintjer Tebbens RJ, Thompson KM |title=Managing the risk of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus during the endgame: oral poliovirus vaccine needs|journal=BMC Infectious Diseases|volume=15|page=390|date=September 2015|doi=10.1186/s12879-015-1114-6| pmid=26404780 | pmc=4582727 | doi-access=free }}</ref>

=== Surveillance ===
A global program of surveillance for the presence of polio and the poliovirus plays a critical role in assessment of eradication and in outbreak detection and response. Two distinct methods are used in tandem: acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) surveillance and environmental surveillance.<ref name="surv" />

Monitoring for AFP aims at identifying outbreaks of polio by screening patients displaying symptoms consistent with, but not exclusive to, severe poliovirus infection. Stool samples are collected from children presenting with AFP and evaluated for the presence of poliovirus by accredited laboratories in the Global Polio Laboratory Network. Since rates of non-polio AFP are expected to be constant and large compared to the number of polio cases, the frequency of non-polio AFP reported in a population is indicative of the effectiveness of surveillance, as is the proportion of AFP patients from whom high-quality stool samples are collected and tested, with a target of at least 80%.<ref name="surv">{{cite journal| vauthors=Patel JC, Diop OM, Gardner T, Chavan S, Jorba J, Wassilak SG, Ahmed J, Snider CJ| title=Surveillance to Track Progress Toward Polio Eradication - Worldwide, 2017-2018| journal=Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report| volume=68| number=13| pages=312–318| date=April 2019| doi=10.15585/mmwr.mm6813a4| pmid=30946737| pmc=6611474| url=https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/68/wr/pdfs/mm6813-H.pdf#page=16| access-date=27 October 2019| archive-date=26 August 2020| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200826054346/https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/68/wr/pdfs/mm6813-H.pdf#page=16| url-status=live}}</ref>

Environmental surveillance is used to supplement AFP surveillance. This entails the routine testing of sewage samples for the presence of virus, which not only allows the effectiveness of vaccination efforts to be evaluated in countries with active transmission, but also allows the detection of new outbreaks in countries without known transmission. In 2018, the GPEI conducted environmental surveillance in 44 countries, 24 of which are in Africa.<ref name="surv" />

=== Obstacles ===

Among the greatest obstacles to global polio eradication are the lack of basic health infrastructure, which limits vaccine distribution and delivery, the crippling effects of civil war and internal strife, and the sometimes oppositional stance that marginalized communities take against what is perceived as a potentially hostile intervention by outsiders. Another challenge has been maintaining the [[Potency (pharmacology)|potency]] of live (attenuated) vaccines in extremely hot or remote areas. The oral polio vaccine must be kept at {{convert|2|to|8|C|F}} for vaccination to be successful.<ref name= Watch/>

An independent evaluation of obstacles to polio eradication requested by the WHO and conducted in 2009 considered the major obstacles in detail by country. In Afghanistan and Pakistan, the researchers concluded that the most significant barrier was insecurity, but that managing human resources, political pressures, the movement of large populations between and within both countries, and inadequately resourced health facilities also posed problems, as did technical issues with the vaccine. In [[India]], the major challenge appeared to be the high efficiency of transmission within the populations of [[Bihar]] and [[Uttar Pradesh]] states, set against the low (~80% after three doses against type{{nbsp}}1) [[seroconversion]] response seen from the vaccine. In Nigeria, the most critical barriers identified were management issues, in particular the highly variable importance ascribed to polio by different authorities at the local government level, although funding issues, community perceptions of vaccine safety, inadequate mobilisation of community groups, and issues with the [[cold chain]]{{Clarify|date=February 2021}} also played a role. In those countries where international spread from endemic countries had resulted in the reestablishment of transmission, namely [[Angola]], [[Chad]], and [[South Sudan]], the key issues identified were underdeveloped health systems and low routine vaccine coverage, although the low level of resources committed to Angola and South Sudan for the purpose of curtailing the spread of polio and climatic factors was also identified as playing a role.<ref name=evaluation>{{cite web|title=Polio Eradication Evaluation |url=http://www.polioeradication.org/content/general/Polio_Evaluation_Report.asp |access-date=19 February 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100706172238/http://www.polioeradication.org/content/general/Polio_Evaluation_Report.asp |archive-date=6 July 2010 }}</ref>

Two additional challenges are found in unobserved polio transmission and in vaccine-derived poliovirus. First, most individuals infected with poliovirus are asymptomatic or exhibit minor symptoms, with fewer than 1% of infections leading to paralysis,<ref>{{cite web |title=Poliomyelitis |publisher=[[World Health Organization]] (WHO) |url=https://www.who.int/biologicals/areas/vaccines/poliomyelitis/en/ |access-date=28 October 2016 |archive-date=24 October 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161024022827/http://www.who.int/biologicals/areas/vaccines/poliomyelitis/en/ |url-status=dead }}</ref> and most infected people are unaware that they carry the disease, allowing polio to spread widely before cases are seen.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Polio and Prevention |url=http://www.polioeradication.org/Polioandprevention.aspx |website=[[Global Polio Eradication Initiative]] (GPEI) |access-date=13 September 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150907175552/http://www.polioeradication.org/Polioandprevention.aspx |archive-date=7 September 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In 2000, using new screening techniques for the molecular characterization of outbreak viral strains, it was discovered that some of the outbreaks were actually caused by circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus, following mutations or recombinations in the attenuated strain used for the oral polio vaccine.

In a 2012 interview with Pakistani newspaper [[Dawn (newspaper)|''Dawn'']], Dr. Hussain A. Gezari, the WHO's special envoy on global polio eradication and primary healthcare, gave his views on obstacles to eradication. He said that the biggest hurdle preventing Pakistan from becoming polio-free was holding district health officials properly accountable—in national eradication campaigns officials had hired their own relatives, even young children. Gezari asked, "How do you expect a seven-year-old thumb-sucking kid to implement a polio campaign of the government?" and added that, in spite of this, "the first national campaign was initiated by your government in 1994 and that year Pakistan reported 25,000 polio cases, and the number was just 198 last year, which clearly shows that the programme is working."<ref name="WHO rejects rumours"/>

====Opposition to vaccination efforts====

One factor contributing to the continued circulation of polio immunization programs has been opposition to vaccination in some countries.<ref name="Religious opposition"/> In one country, Pakistan, "more than 200 polio team workers" have  been  killed (team members include not only vaccinators but police and security personnel) from "targeted killing and terrorism" while working on polio campaigns,<ref name="History-APJPH-2023">{{cite journal |last1=Wahid |first1=Braira |last2=Kumari |first2=Babita |last3=Saifullah |first3=Khaled Mohammed |last4=Idrees |first4=Muhammad |title=The History and Current Killings of Polio Vaccinators in Pakistan: A Need for Targeted Surveillance Strategy |journal=Asian Pacific Journal of Public Health |date=March 2023 |volume=35 |issue=2–3 |pages=183–188 |doi=10.1177/10105395231158866 |pmid=36856226 |pmc=10185917 }}</ref> (the killers motivated by the belief, spread by "radical clerics",  that the vaccine is part of "a Western plot to sterilize Muslims").<ref>{{cite journal|title=Health workers murdered as Pakistan vaccinates 8.4 million children |url=https://www.cmaj.ca/content/186/9/E302 |author=Ashfaq Yusufzai |journal=CMAJ |date=10 June 2014|volume =186 |issue=9 |pages=E302 |doi= 10.1503/cmaj.109-4776 |pmid=24756620 |pmc=4050009 |access-date=4 October 2023}}</ref>

In the context of the [[United States invasion of Afghanistan]] and the subsequent [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], rumours arose in the Muslim world that immunization campaigns were using intentionally-contaminated vaccines to sterilize local Muslim populations or to infect them with [[HIV]]. In Nigeria these rumours fit in with a longstanding suspicion of modern biomedicine, which since its introduction during the era of [[colonialism]] has been viewed as a projection of the power of western nations.   Refusal of vaccination came to be viewed as resistance to western expansionism, and when the contamination rumours led the Nigerian Supreme Council for Sharia to call for a region-wide boycott of polio vaccination, polio cases in the country increased more than five-fold between 2002 and 2006, with the uncontrolled virus then spreading across Africa and globally.<ref name=Ghani>{{cite journal |last1=Ghani |first1=Isaac |last2=Willott |first2=Chris |last3=Dadari |first3=Ibrahim |last4=Larson |first4=Heidi J. |title=Listening to the rumours: What the northern Nigeria polio vaccine boycott can tell us ten years on |journal=Global Public Health |volume=8 |issue=10 |pages=1138–1150 |year=2013 |doi=10.1080/17441692.2013.859720|pmid=24294986 |pmc=4098042 }}</ref><ref name=Njeru >{{cite journal|title=Did the call for boycott by the Catholic bishops affect the polio vaccination coverage in Kenya in 2015?

Polio vaccination efforts have also faced resistance in another form. The priority placed on vaccination by national authorities has turned it into a bargaining chip, with communities and interest groups resisting vaccination, not due to direct opposition, but to leverage other concessions from governmental authorities.

According to modeling, it can take four to six months of no reported cases to achieve only a 50% chance of eradication, and one to two years for e.g. 95% chance.<ref name=":3" /><ref name="Kalkowska 66"/> Sensitivity of monitoring for circulation can be improved by sampling sewage. In Pakistan in the last couple of years, the number of paralysis cases has dropped relatively faster than the positive environmental samples, which has shown no progress since 2015. The presence of multiple infections with the same strain in the upstream area may not be detectable, so there are some saturation effects when monitoring the number of positive environmental samples.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-now/surveillance-indicators/|title=Surveillance Indicators|website=[[Global Polio Eradication Initiative]] (GPEI)|access-date=25 March 2018|archive-date=26 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180326064153/http://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-now/surveillance-indicators/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |vauthors=Cowger TL, Burns CC, Sharif S, Gary HE, Iber J, Henderson E, Malik F, Zahoor Zaidi SS, Shaukat S, Rehman L, Pallansch MA, Orenstein WA |date=25 July 2017|title=The role of supplementary environmental surveillance to complement acute flaccid paralysis surveillance for wild poliovirus in Pakistan - 2011-2013 |journal=PLOS ONE|volume=12|issue=7|pages=e0180608|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0180608|pmid=28742803|pmc=5526532|issn=1932-6203|bibcode=2017PLoSO..1280608C |doi-access=free}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://www.science.org/content/article/what-hell-going-polio-cases-are-vanishing-pakistan-yet-virus-wont-go-away|title='What the hell is going on?'

In 1988, the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), together with [[Rotary International]], [[UNICEF]], and the U.S. [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) passed the [[Global Polio Eradication Initiative]] (GPEI), with the goal of eradicating polio by the year 2000.

In 2002, an outbreak of polio occurred in India. The number of planned polio vaccination campaigns had recently been reduced, and populations in northern India, particularly from the Islamic background, engaged in mass resistance to immunization.{{citation needed|date=September 2021}} At this time, the Indian state [[Uttar Pradesh]] accounted for nearly two-thirds of total worldwide cases reported.<ref>{{cite press release | title = WHO Director-General calls India 'number 1' polio eradication priority | work = [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) | url =https://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2003/pr30/en/index.html | date = 7 April 2003 | access-date = 31 July 2007 | archive-date = 19 June 2007 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070619143940/http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2003/pr30/en/index.html | url-status = dead }}</ref> (See the [[:Image:Poliokarte-Dezember-2002.jpg|2002 Global polio incidence map]].) However, by 2004, India had adopted strategies to increase ownership of polio vaccinations in marginalized populations, and the immunity gap in vulnerable groups rapidly closed.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

In August 2003, rumors spread in some states in Nigeria, especially [[Kano State|Kano]], that the vaccine caused sterility in girls. This resulted in the suspension of immunization efforts in the state, causing a dramatic rise in polio rates in the already endemic country.<ref name="Jegede2007">{{cite journal |last1=Jegede |first1=A.

In addition to the rumors of sterility and the ban by Nigeria's Kano state, civil war and internal strife in [[Sudan]] and [[Côte d'Ivoire]] have complicated WHO's polio eradication goal. In 2004, almost two-thirds of all the polio cases in the world occurred in Nigeria (760 out of 1,170 total).{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

In May 2004, the first case of the polio outbreak in Sudan was detected. The reemergence of polio led to stepped up vaccination campaigns. In the city of [[Darfur]], 78,654 children were immunized and 20,432 more in southern Sudan (Yirol and Chelkou).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.noticias.info/Archivo/2005/200505/20050511/20050511_65088.shtm|archive-url=https://archive.today/20060812160409/http://www.noticias.info/Archivo/2005/200505/20050511/20050511_65088.shtm|archive-date=12 August 2006|title=Sudan: Bulletin No. 28|date=11 May 2005|work=International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC)|access-date=7 February 2007|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 2006, only four countries in the world (Nigeria, India, [[Pakistan]], and [[Afghanistan]]) were reported to have endemic polio. Cases in other countries are attributed to importation. A total of 1,997 cases worldwide were reported in 2006; of these the majority (1,869 cases) occurred in countries with endemic polio.<ref name=":0" /> Nigeria accounted for the majority of cases (1,122 cases) but India reported more than ten times more cases in 2006 than in 2005 (676 cases, or 30% of worldwide cases). Pakistan and Afghanistan reported 40 and 31 cases respectively in 2006. Polio re-surfaced in [[Bangladesh]] after nearly six years of absence with 18 new cases reported. "Our country is not safe, as neighbours India and Pakistan are not polio free", declared Health Minister ASM Matiur Rahman.<ref name="BBC World">{{cite news | title = Bangladesh begins new polio drive | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/6412835.stm | work = [[BBC News Online]] | date = 2 March 2007 | access-date = 31 July 2007 | archive-date = 25 April 2019 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190425062256/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/6412835.stm | url-status = live }}</ref> (See: [[:Image:Poliomyelite.png|Map of reported polio cases in 2006]])

In 2007, there were 1,315 cases of poliomyelitis reported worldwide.<ref name=":0" /> Over 60% of cases (874) occurred in India. In Nigeria, the number of polio cases fell dramatically, from 1,122 cases reported in 2006 to 285 cases in 2007. Officials credit the drop in new infections to improved political control in the southern states and resumed immunisation in the north, where Muslim clerics led a boycott of vaccination in late 2003. Local governments and clerics allowed vaccinations to resume on the condition that the vaccines be manufactured in Indonesia, a majority Muslim country, and not in the United States.<ref name=Nigeria/> [[Turai Yar'Adua]], wife of recently elected Nigerian president [[Umaru Yar'Adua]], made the eradication of polio one of her priorities.

The largest numbers were in Nigeria (798 cases) and India (559 cases): these two countries combined had 82.2 percent of all cases. Outside endemic countries, Chad reported the greatest number (37 cases).<ref name=":0" />

In 2009, a total of 1,604 cases were reported across 23 countries. Four endemic countries accounted for 1,256 of these, with the remaining 348 in 19 sub-Saharan countries with imported cases or re-established transmission. Once again, the largest numbers were in India (741) and Nigeria (388).<ref name=":0" /> All other countries had less than one hundred cases: Pakistan had 89 cases, Afghanistan 38, [[Chad]] 64, Sudan 45, [[Guinea]] 42, Angola 29, [[Côte d'Ivoire]] 26, [[Benin]] 20, [[Kenya]] 19, [[Burkina Faso]] 15, [[Niger]] 15, the [[Central African Republic]] 14, [[Mauritania]] 13, and [[Liberia]] and [[Sierra Leone]] both had 11. The following countries had single-digit numbers of cases: [[Uganda]] with 8 cases, [[Togo]] 6, [[Cameroon]] 3, the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] 3, [[Burundi]] 2, and [[Mali]] 2.

According to figures updated in April 2012, the WHO reported that there were 1,352 cases of wild polio across 20 countries in 2010. Reported cases of polio were down 95% in Nigeria (to a historic low of 21 cases) and 94% in India (to a historic low of 42 cases) compared to the previous year, with little change in Afghanistan (from 38 to 25 cases) and an increase in cases in Pakistan (from 89 to 144 cases). An acute outbreak in [[Tajikistan]] gave rise to 460 cases (34% of the global total), and was associated with a further 18 cases across Central Asia ([[Kazakhstan]] and [[Turkmenistan]]) and the Russian Federation, with the most recent case from this region being reported from Russia 25 September.

The residual effects of the COVID-19 pandemic continued to be a cause for concern, due to an increased risk of undetected outbreaks due to COVID's interference with routine health care, disease detection, and childhood vaccinations, as well as a concern that an increased fear of vaccines, caused at least in part by politicization of vaccination and bad governance during the pandemic, may result in a general pattern of undervaccination, including for polio.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Kenen |first1=Joanne |date=2022-03-28 |title=Polio's back.

However, the situation had improved compared to previous years as the government and law-enforcement increased their focus.

{{stack end}}As of October 31, ten cases of WPV1 have been reported in 2023, six in Afghanistan and four in Pakistan. Additionally, almost 100 positive environmental samples were reported so far in those countries.<ref name="WPVcurrent" />
There have been 237 confirmed cases of cVDPV2 reported to the WHO so far in 2023, across seventeen countries. 
cVDPV1 is now concentrated in two countries, 79 cases in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and 23 in Madagascar. Mozambique had three cases this year up until February. 
No cVDPV3 virus has been detected for over one and a half years now.<ref name="VDPVcurrent" /> 

The Independent Monitoring Board of the GPEI in its September 2023 Report <ref>{{cite web | url=https://polioeradication.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/22nd-Report-of-The-Independent-Monitoring-Board-IMB.pdf | title=Closing in on zero}}</ref> mentioned a continued, geographically restricted, endemic transmission in the east of Afghanistan and in the southern districts of Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. 
All but one wild polio generic cluster remains in Afghanistan in a much improved immunity (>90%) of the population. Levels of access in the country are the best they have been since 2018. 
However, a large pool of unvaccinated children remain in the Kandahar province potentially leading to a large outbreak, if the virus reappears there. 
In Pakistan, they esteem that the long-standing and intractable poliovirus circulation in most of the traditional endemic
reservoirs has been eliminated.
However, a positive environmental probe in Karachi, after no cases for over a year, raised concerns about the vaccination campaign quality in Pakistan.
In conclusion, the report finds it is highly likely that the goal of interrupting wild poliovirus transmission this year will be missed. It is certain that ending transmission of vaccine-derived poliovirus will not be possible this year.

===Post-Eradication Plans===
As of 2023, WPV2 and WPV3 are certified as eradicated, while certification of WPV1 is expected for 2026/7<ref name="PES2022">{{cite web |title=GPEI Strategy 2022-2026 |url=https://polioeradication.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Polio-Eradication-Strategy-2022-2026-Delivering-on-a-Promise.pdf |publisher=Global Polio Eradication Initiative}}</ref>{{rp|7}}

Certification of wild poliovirus eradication requires three consecutive years without case reports, in the presence of reliable disease surveillance networks.<ref>{{cite web |title=Polio containment and certification |url=https://www.emro.who.int/polio-eradication/about-eradication/polio-containment-and-certification.html |website=World Health Organization - Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean |language=en-gb}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=GPEI-Certification |url=https://polioeradication.org/polio-today/preparing-for-a-polio-free-world/certification/}}</ref> Beginning at certification of WPV eradication, the post-certification strategy will come into effect,<ref name=PCS>{{cite book |title=Polio Post-Certification Strategy |publisher=Global Polio Eradication Initiative |url=https://polioeradication.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/polio-post-certification-strategy-20180424-2.pdf}}</ref>{{rp|6}} with program priorities shifting towards outbreak preparedness and containment of existing virus material rather than circulating disease.<ref name=PES2022/>{{rp|40}} Vaccination for WPV1 will cease one year following eradication certification, and eradication of vaccine-derived poliovirus is then targeted for 2030<ref name=PES2022/>{{rp|21}}

Where possible, the number of facilities conducting operations with poliovirus is to be reduced significantly; and the use of wild poliovirus is to be abandoned altogether in favour of genetically-stabilized attenuated strains where possible.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Poliomyelitis eradication — Report by the Director-General |date=6 May 2022 |page=5 |url=https://apps.who.int/gb/ebwha/pdf_files/WHA75/A75_23-en.pdf |publisher=Seventy-Fifth World Health Assembly}}</ref> As of May 2021, there are 74 designated Poliovirus Essential Facilities (PEFs) across 24 countries<ref name=GAP4/>{{rp|41}} where work on poliovirus can be carried out. These facilities are currently involved in producing materials to assist the eradication initiative, and perform crucial research which may prevent future outbreaks. After certification, these facilities retain the equipment and materials to continue vaccine production in the event of deliberate or accidental release.<ref name=GAP4>{{cite book |title=WHO Global Action Plan for Poliovirus Containment |publisher=Global Polio Eradication Initiative |url=https://polioeradication.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/WHO-Global-Action-Plan-for-Poliovirus-Containment-GAPIV.pdf}}</ref>{{rp|17}} Work on Poliovirus outside of the PEFs will be prohibited, and stocks in laboratories that are not designated as PEFs must either be transferred to a PEF or destroyed.<ref name=GAP4/>{{rp|26}}

By 2022 all stocks of WPV2 had been transferred to PEFs and full containment is in effect. All other strains are in a transitionary status.<ref name=GAP4/>{{rp|35}}{{Clear}}
