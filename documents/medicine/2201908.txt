'''''Ornithobacterium rhinotracheale''''', or '''ORT''', is a [[bacteria|bacterium]] that causes [[Respiration (physiology)|respiratory]] disease in [[poultry]]. It can cause disease in birds of all ages and is potentially fatal.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019|reason=removed citation to predatory publisher content}}  ''O. rhinotracheale'' is found worldwide, and the bacterium may be spread between birds either [[Horizontal transmission|horizontally]] or [[Vertical transmission|vertically]]. It is not a [[zoonosis]].

==Clinical Signs==
Most commonly, respiratory signs are seen. These include nasal discharge, [[dyspnoea]], [[sneezing]] and [[coughing]]. A drop in growth rates and abnormal egg production and joint problems may also be seen. There are reports of gastrointestinal and neurological symptoms in some cases.

Clinical signs are generally worse in [[Broiler|meat producing birds]].

==Diagnosis==

The disease caused by ORT is characterized by [[pneumonia]], [[pleuritis]] and [[air sacculitis]] on postmortem examination. However diagnosis should be confirmed using laboratory tests such as [[bacterial culture]], [[Polymerase chain reaction|PCR]], [[agar gel]] precipitation, [[ELISA]] and serum agglutination.

==Treatment & Control==
[[Antibiotic]] treatment can be attempted, but is not always successful. The choice of antibiotic should be based on [[Kirby-Bauer antibiotic testing|culture and sensitivity]] results.

[[Vaccination]] is reported to reduce the incidence of disease.
