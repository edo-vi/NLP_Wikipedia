'''Isaac Swainson'''  (1746–1812) was famous for his [[botanical garden]], which was largely funded from the profits of a [[herbal remedy]] for [[venereal disease]]. For his commercial activities in the latter field, he has been called a "radical [[Quackery|quack]]".<ref name="quack">McCalman, Iain.

A plant [[genus]] is named after him.

==Velnos' Vegetable Syrup==
Swainson moved to London where he served as assistant to a Dr. Mercier in [[Frith Street]], [[Soho]], where he settled. Later, he purchased from Mercier the recipe of a patent medicine called "Velnos' Vegetable Syrup", named after Vergery de Velnos. This was one of many cures for venereal diseases based on plants rather than [[Mercury (element)|mercury]], which is toxic. The brand became well-known and Swainson reputedly made as much as £5,000 a year from its sales.<ref name="twickenham">{{Cite web|url=http://www.twickenham-museum.org.uk/types_detail.asp?CategoryName=Garden%20Designers%20and%20Horticulturists|title=Twickenham Museum Biography}}</ref> In addition to curing venereal diseases, including "the pox" and the "French disease", it was claimed to cure [[leprosy]], [[gout]], [[scrophula]], [[dropsy]], [[small pox]], [[Tuberculosis|consumption]], [[tape worm]]s, [[cancer]], [[scurvy]], and [[diarrhea]]<ref name="birth">.

Swainson also studied the conventional medicine of the era and gained an MD in 1785. There is no record of his subsequent election to the [[Royal College of Physicians]].<ref name="twickenham" />

==Sturt's Desert Pea==
Swainson, who was less noted for botany, is honoured by the [[genus]] name [[Swainsona]], which is now known as the emblem of South Australia. Its common name is Sturt's desert pea.<ref>http://www.anbg.gov.au/emblems/sa.emblem.html Australian National Botanic Gardens</ref>
