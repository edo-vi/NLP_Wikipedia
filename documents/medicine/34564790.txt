The other additions in UIP through the way are [[Inactivated vaccine|inactivated]] [[polio vaccine]] (IPV), [[rotavirus vaccine]] (RVV), [[Measles vaccine|Measles]]-[[Rubella vaccine|Rubella]] vaccine (MR). Four new vaccines have been introduced into the country’s Universal Immunisation Programme (UIP), including injectable polio vaccine, an adult vaccine against Japanese Encephalitis and [[Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine|Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine]].{{cn|date=March 2022}}

Vaccines against rotavirus, rubella and polio (injectable) will help the country meet its [[Millennium Development Goals]] 4 targets that include reducing child mortality by two-thirds by 2015, besides meeting meet global polio eradication targets. An adult vaccine against Japanese encephalitis was also introduced in districts with high levels of the disease. The recommendations to introduce these new vaccines have been made after numerous scientific studies and comprehensive deliberations by the [[National Immunization Technical Advisory Group|National Technical Advisory Group of India]] (NTAGI), the country’s apex scientific advisory body on immunisation.{{cn|date=March 2022}}

Vaccine benefits are debated with some urging caution in the choice of vaccines introduced while expanding the immunisation programme, despite overwhelming and widespread documented scientific evidence on the efficacy of vaccines.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Andre F|author2=Booy R|author3=Bock H|title=Vaccination greatly reduces disease, disability, death and inequity worldwide|journal=Bulletin of the World Health Organization|year=2008|volume=86|issue=2|pages=140–146|doi=10.2471/BLT.07.040089|pmid=18297169|pmc=2647387}}</ref>

With these new vaccines, India’s UIP will now provide universal and free vaccines against 13{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} life threatening diseases, to 27 million children annually.
Calling it one of the most significant health policies in the last 30 years, the note pointed out that the latest decision along with the recently introduced [[pentavalent vaccine]], will help prevent death in about one lakh infants and adults in the working age group, besides putting a stop to about 10 lakh hospitalizations each year.{{cn|date=July 2023}}

“The introduction of four new lifesaving vaccines, will play a key role in reducing the childhood and infant mortality and morbidity in the country. Many of these vaccines are already available through private practitioners to those who can afford them. The government will now ensure that the benefits of vaccination reach all sections of the society, regardless of social and economic status,” the PM said.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.livemint.com/Politics/dRUdNB3m65UAGb0RAmvWTO/Govt-adds-4-vaccines-to-immunisation-programme.html |title= Govt adds 4 vaccines to immunisation programme |date= July 3, 2014 |publisher= Livemint |access-date=February 18, 2017}}</ref>
