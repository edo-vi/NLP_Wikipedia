{{Short description|Concept from traditional Chinese medicine}}

As distinct from the Western medical concept of the [[pericardium]], this concept from [[traditional Chinese medicine]] describes a set of interrelated parts rather than an anatomical organ (see [[Zang Fu theory]]).

The Pericardium network includes the pericardial sac, the Pericardium meridian, the small intestine and some parts of the brain.<ref name=FS />

The Pericardium is also called the "heart protector",<ref name=FS>{{cite web |url= https://fiveseasonsmedicine.com/the-pericardium-channel-self-love-and-relationships/|title= The Pericardium Channel, Self Love and Relationships

In general theory, the Pericardium is not distinguished from the Heart.  It is also the first line of defence against the Heart from External Pathogenic Influences. In terms of the [[Wuxing (Chinese philosophy)|Five Elements]], these organs are both associated with the fire element.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://torbay-acupuncture-centre.co.uk/function-pericardium//|title= The Function of the Pericardium|last= Geary|first= Rachel|date= August 10, 2021|website= Torbay Acupuncture Centre|publisher= |access-date= 2023-10-20|quote=}}</ref> 

The Pericardium has a [[Meridian (Chinese medicine)|meridian]] named for it, which reflects the health of the organ. According to traditional Chinese medicine, it is often best to approach the treatment of [[heart]] problems via the Pericardium, rather than the heart directly. {{Citation needed|reason=Unjustified comment, medical in nature|date=January 2022}}
