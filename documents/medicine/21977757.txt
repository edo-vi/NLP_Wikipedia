{{Short description|Genetically modified mosquito that injects vaccines into people}}
'''Flying syringe''' is a phrase that is used to refer to proposed, but not yet created, [[genetically modified]] [[mosquitoes]] that inject [[vaccines]] into [[Human|people]] when they bite them.<ref>[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123680870885500701 Rocket Scientists Shoot Down Mosquitoes With Lasers], Wall St. Journal, March 14, 2009</ref>

==History==
In the 1990s, Bob Sinden of Imperial College, London, and [[Julian Crampton]] of the University of Liverpool, developed this idea and filled three related patents between 1997 and 2003.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.malariaworld.org/blogs/breakthrough-week-flying-syringes |title='Breakthrough' of the week: Flying syringes |access-date=2022-09-30 |website=www.malariaworld.org |date=19 March 2010}}</ref>

In 2008, the [[Gates Foundation]] awarded $100,000 to Hiroyuki Matsuoka of [[Jichi Medical University]] in [[Japan]] to do research on them, with a condition that any discoveries that were funded by the grant must be made available at affordable prices in the [[developing world]]. If Matsuoka proves that his idea has merit, he will be eligible for an additional $1 million of funding. ''[[The Washington Post]]'' referred to flying syringes as a "bold idea".<ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/22/AR2008102203083.html Flying Syringes and Other Bold Ideas], ''The Washington Post'', October 23, 2008</ref>
