'''Scottie Cramp''' is a disease in [[Scottish Terrier]]s causing spasms and hyperflexion and hyperextension of the legs.  It is caused by a disorder in [[serotonin]] metabolism that causes a deficiency of available serotonin.<ref name=Ettinger_1995>{{cite book|author1=Ettinger, Stephen J. |author2=Feldman, Edward C. |title=Textbook of Veterinary Internal Medicine|edition=4th|publisher=W.B.

Scotty Cramp occurs in puppies and young dogs.  Symptoms present after exercise or excitement and last a few minutes.  A goose-stepping gait and arched spine are often seen, and the dog may turn [[somersault]]s as it runs.  The symptoms usually resolve after ten minutes, but they may repeat several times in a day.<ref>{{cite web|author=Braund, K.G.|year=2003|title=Paroxysmal Disorders|work=Braund's Clinical Neurology in Small Animals: Localization, Diagnosis and Treatment|url=http://www.ivis.org/advances/Vite/braund29/chapter_frm.asp?LA=1|accessdate=2007-01-28}}</ref> Episodes of Scottie Cramp can also be triggered by added stress on the dog.<ref>{{Cite web|last=dcwd|title=Genetic Issues Scottish Terrier Club of America -|url=https://stca.biz/about-the-breed/health/genetic-issues/|access-date=2021-09-15|website=Scottish Terrier Club of America|language=en-US}}</ref>  At this time there is known [[genetic testing]] available for Scottie Cramp, even though this is considered a genetic disease.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Paul Pion|first=D.

In affected dogs, this will block serotonin and increase the frequency and severity of the symptoms.<ref name=Ettinger_1995/>  [[Diazepam]] or [[acepromazine]] is used to control the symptoms of Scotty Cramp.  [[Tocopherol|Vitamin E]] may also be of some benefit.<ref name=Chrisman_2003>{{cite book|author1=Chrisman, Cheryl |author2=Clemmons, Roger |author3=Mariani, Christopher |author4=Platt, Simon |title=Neurology for the Small Animal Practitioner|edition=1st|publisher=Teton New Media|year=2003|isbn=1-893441-82-2}}</ref>  Because Scotty Cramp is inherited, affected dogs and their parents and siblings should not be bred.
