The '''Veterinary College Admission Test''', often called the '''VCAT''', was a former [[veterinary school]] admissions examination. Depending on the school, pre-veterinary students usually take the [[Graduate Record Examinations]] (GRE) or the [[Medical College Admission Test]] (MCAT) for entrance to schools now.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ctahr.hawaii.edu/hnfas/degrees/undergrad/preVet.html |title=University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa Pre-Veterinary Medicine Program |accessdate=Feb 15, 2013}}</ref>
