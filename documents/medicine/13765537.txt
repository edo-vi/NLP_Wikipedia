'''Hepatic microvascular dysplasia''' ('''HMD''' or '''MVD''') or '''portal atresia''' is a disorder where mixing of [[venous blood]] and [[artery|arterial blood]] in the [[liver]] occurs at the [[microscopic]] level. It occurs most commonly in certain dog breeds such as the [[Cairn Terrier|Cairn]] and [[Yorkshire terrier]]s although any dog breed may be at risk.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vetinfo4dogs.com/dliver.html#Hepatic%20microvascular%20dysplasia|accessdate=2007-10-17|title =Liver Disease in Dogs}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vetcentric.com/magazine/magazineArticle.cfm?ARTICLEID=951 |accessdate=2007-10-17 |title=When the Liver Isn't Getting Enough Blood |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020501203403/http://www.vetcentric.com/magazine/magazineArticle.cfm?ARTICLEID=951 |archivedate=2002-05-01 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.acvs.org/AnimalOwners/HealthConditions/SmallAnimalTopics/HMD/ |accessdate=2007-10-17 |title=HEPATIC MICROVASCULAR DYSPLASIA OR PORTAL ATRESIA |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071024152834/http://www.acvs.org/AnimalOwners/HealthConditions/SmallAnimalTopics/HMD/ |archivedate=2007-10-24 }}</ref>

This disease may also be found in cats.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

HMD is sometimes misdiagnosed as Portosystemic vascular anomaly (PSVA) or a "Liver Shunt" ([[portosystemic shunt]]). HMD can be diagnosed with an MRI, using a tracing dye in the subject's blood, and observing the flow of blood through the subject's liver and surrounding areas (stomach, intestine) for anomalies. It can also be diagnosed using a bile-acid level test; or more accurately, a "fasting-blood ammonia levels" test. Symptoms include stunted growth in the first 6â€“9 months, vomiting, seizures, and hydro-encephalitic episodes (from ammonia concentrating in the blood).{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} HMD is usually treated non-surgically with antibiotics ([[metronidazole]]) and stool-softeners ([[lactulose]]).{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}
