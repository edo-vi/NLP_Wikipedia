'''Balanced ligamentous tension''' (also known as '''balanced ligamentous tension release''', '''ligamentous  articular strain''', or simply '''BLT''') is both an indirect and direct technique used in [[osteopathic manipulative medicine]].

== History ==
The technique was reportedly invented by [[Andrew Taylor Still|A.T. Still]]. It was later described by his students Rebecca Lippincott and [[William Garner Sutherland, D.O.|William Garner Sutherland]], who greatly expanded it.<ref name = "DiGiovanna">DEileen L DiGiovanna, Stanley Schiowitz, Dennis J Dowling.  ''An Osteopathic Approach to Diagnosis and Treatment, 2nd Ed.'' Lippincott. 2004.</ref> It was described in “Osteopathic Technique of William G. Sutherland,” which was published in the ''1949 Year Book of Academy of Applied Osteopathy.'' According to Sutherland's model, all the joints in the body are balanced ligamentous articular mechanisms. The ligaments provide proprioceptive information that guides the muscle response for positioning the joint, and the ligaments themselves guide the motion of the articular components.<ref>{{cite web|title=Glossary of Osteopathic Terminology|url=http://www.aacom.org/resources/bookstore/Documents/GOT2011ed.pdf|publisher=American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine|page=29|date=April 2009|access-date=25 August 2012|archive-date=2 October 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002131413/http://www.aacom.org/resources/bookstore/Documents/GOT2011ed.pdf|url-status=dead}}</ref>

== Execution ==
The technique has many variants.  The general prescription is to disengage and exaggerate the diagnosed somatic dysfunction. This is the indirect component. The practitioner then waits for a change in the palpatory quality of the structure being treated, i.e., a change in skin tension, temperature, or muscle tension. This is followed by a balancing stage in which the practitioner slowly brings the joint into the diagnosed restriction (the direct component).
