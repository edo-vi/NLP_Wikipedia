== Medical usage ==

The principal medical usages of enemas are:

=== Bowel cleansing ===
==== Acute treatments ====
As [[bowel]] stimulants, enemas are employed for the same purposes as orally administered [[laxative]]s: to relieve [[constipation]]; to treat [[fecal impaction]]; to empty the colon prior to a medical procedure such as a [[colonoscopy]]. When oral laxatives are not indicated or are not sufficiently effective, enemas may be a sensible and necessary measure.<ref name="Pharmacological treatment"/>

A large volume enema<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/medical/high%20enema|title=high enema |website=Medical Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-Webster |access-date=17 February 2018}}</ref> can be given to cleanse as much of the colon as possible of feces.<ref>{{cite web |title=Administering an Enema |url=http://intranet.tdmu.edu.ua/data/kafedra/internal/meds/prac_skills_alg/Care%20of%20patients/Administering%20an%20Enema.htm |website=Care of patients |date=14 July 2015 |publisher=Ternopil State Medical University |access-date=17 February 2018 |url-status=dead |archive-date=23 February 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180223111015/http://intranet.tdmu.edu.ua/data/kafedra/internal/meds/prac_skills_alg/Care%20of%20patients/Administering%20an%20Enema.htm}}</ref><ref name="Fundamentals of Nursing Practice">{{cite web |url=http://www.peoi.org/Courses/Coursesen/nursepractice/ch/ch12e1.html |title=Types of Enemas |website=Fundamentals of Nursing Practice |publisher=Professional Education, Testing and Certification Organization International |author=Rhodora Cruz |access-date=17 February 2018}}</ref> However, a low enema is generally useful only for stool in the rectum, not in the intestinal tract.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/medical/low%20enema|title=low enema |website=Medical Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-Webster |access-date=17 February 2018}}</ref>

Such enemas' mechanism consists of the volume of the liquid causing a rapid expansion of the intestinal tract in conjunction with, in the case of certain solutions, irritation of the intestinal [[mucosa]] which stimulates peristalsis and lubricates the stool to encourage a bowel movement.<ref name=Nursing_and_Allied_Health/> An enema's efficacy depends on several factors including the volume injected and the temperature and the contents of the infusion.<ref name="Pharmacological treatment"/> In order for the enema to be effective the patient should retain the solution for five to ten minutes, as tolerated.<ref name=Biology_Online_Dictionary/><ref name=Nursing_and_Allied_Health/> or, as some nursing textbooks recommend, for five to fifteen minutes or as long as possible.<ref name=Safety_and_effectiveness/>

===== Large volume enemas =====
{{anchor|Soapsuds enema}}
[[File:Soapsuds Enemas.jpg|thumb|Soapsuds enemas, one in an enema bucket with a nozzle typical for a cleansing enema, and another in an enema bag with a nozzle typical for a contrast enema]]

For emptying the entire colon as much as feasible<ref name="Fundamentals of Nursing Practice"/> deeper and higher enemas are utilized to reach large sections of the colon.<ref name="Pharmacological treatment"/> The colon dilates and expands when a large volume of liquid is injected into it, and the colon reacts to that sudden expansion with general contractions, [[Peristalsis#Large intestine|peristalsis]], propelling its contents toward the rectum.<ref name= Biology_Online_Dictionary />

'''Soapsuds enema''' is a frequently used synonym for a large volume enema (although soap is not necessary for effectivity).<ref name= Biology_Online_Dictionary />

For relieving occasional constipation, a large volume enema may be used in a home setting, although for recurring or severe cases of constipation medical care may be required.<ref name= Biology_Online_Dictionary />

====== Water-based solutions ======

Plain water can be used, simply functioning mechanically to expand the colon, thus prompting evacuation.

[[saline (medicine)#Normal|Normal saline]] is least irritating to the colon. Like plain water, it simply functions mechanically to expand the colon, but having a neutral concentration gradient, it neither draws [[electrolyte]]s from the body, as happens with plain water, nor draws water into the colon, as occurs with phosphates. Thus, a salt water solution can be used when a longer period of retention is desired, such as to soften an impaction.

[[Castile soap]] is commonly added because its irritation of the colon's lining increases the urgency to defecate.<ref name=Safety_and_effectiveness>{{cite journal|title=Safety and effectiveness of large-volume enema solutions |author1=Marilee Schmelzer |author2=Lawrence R.

The term ''retrograde irrigation'' distinguishes this procedure from the [[Malone antegrade continence enema]], where irrigation fluid is introduced into the colon proximal to the anus via a surgically created irrigation port.

===== Bowel management =====
{{Main|Bowel management}}
Patients who have a bowel disability, a medical condition which impairs control of [[defecation]], e.g., fecal incontinence or constipation,<ref name="Bowel management definition">{{cite web|title=Bowel Management After Spinal Cord Injury|url=http://www.sci-info-pages.com/bowel.html|website=sci-info-pages.com|date=2 June 2019|language=en}}</ref> can use bowel management techniques to choose a predictable time and place to evacuate.<ref name="Bowel management definition"/> Without bowel management, such persons might either suffer from the feeling of not getting relief, or they might soil themselves.<ref name="Bowel management definition"/>

=== Contrast (X-ray) ===

[[File:Barium Contrast Enema.jpg|thumb|A barium enema in a disposable bag manufactured for that purpose]]

In a [[lower gastrointestinal series]] an enema that may contain [[Barium sulphate#Radiocontrast agent|barium sulfate]] powder or a water-soluble contrast agent is used in the [[Röntgen ray|radiological]] imaging of the bowel. Called a ''barium enema'', such enemas are sometimes the only practical way to ''view'' the colon in a relatively safe manner.<ref name=NIH_barium />

=== Medication administration ===

The administration of substances into the bloodstream. This may be done in situations where it is undesirable or impossible to deliver a medication by mouth, such as [[antiemetic]]s given to reduce [[nausea]] (though not many antiemetics are delivered by enema). Additionally, several anti-angiogenic agents, which work better without digestion, can be safely administered via a gentle enema.

The topical administration of medications into the rectum, such as [[corticosteroids]] and [[mesalazine]] used in the treatment of [[inflammatory bowel disease]]. Administration by enema avoids having the medication pass through the entire [[gastrointestinal tract]], therefore simplifying the delivery of the medication to the affected area and limiting the amount that is absorbed into the bloodstream.

Rectal corticosteroid enemas are sometimes used to treat mild or moderate ulcerative colitis. They also may be used along with systemic (oral or injection) corticosteroids or other medicines to treat severe disease or mild to moderate disease that has spread too far to be treated effectively by medicine inserted into the rectum alone.

== Adverse effects ==

Improper administration of an enema can cause electrolyte imbalance (with repeated enemas) or ruptures to the bowel or rectal tissues resulting in internal [[bleeding]]. However, these occurrences are rare in healthy, [[sobriety|sober]] adults. Internal bleeding or rupture may leave the individual exposed to infections from intestinal bacteria. Blood resulting from tears in the colon may not always be visible, but can be distinguished if the feces are unusually dark or have a red hue. If intestinal rupture is suspected, medical assistance should be obtained immediately.<ref name=Nursing_and_Allied_Health>{{Cite encyclopedia |title=Enema administration |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Nursing and Allied Health |first=Mary Elizabeth |last=Martelli |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_gGENH/is_/ai_2699003276.htm |access-date=11 January 2008 |via=[[FindArticles]] |url-status=dead |archive-date=23 January 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080123073414/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_gGENH/is_/ai_2699003276.htm}}</ref> Frequent use of enemas can cause laxative dependency.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-14831/fleet-enema-rectal/details |title=Fleet Enema Rectal: Uses, Side Effects, Interactions, Pictures, Warnings & Dosing |website=WebMD}}</ref>

The enema tube and solution may stimulate the [[vagus nerve]], which may trigger an [[Heart arrhythmia|arrhythmia]] such as [[bradycardia]].

Enemas should not be used if there is an undiagnosed [[abdominal pain]] since the peristalsis of the bowel can cause an inflamed [[Vermiform appendix|appendix]] to [[Appendicitis|rupture]].

== History ==

=== Etymology ===

''Enema'' entered the English language c. 1675 from Latin in which, in the 15th century,<ref name=Free_Dictionary_Enema/> it was first used in the sense of a rectal injection,<ref name=Merriam-Webster_Enema/> from Greek ἔνεμα (énema), "injection", itself from ἐνιέναι (enienai) "to send in, inject", from ἐν (en), "in" + ἱέναι (hienai), "to send, throw".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.etymonline.com/search?q=enema |title=enema (n.) |work=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]] |publisher=Douglas Harper of the [[LNP Media Group]] |access-date=2019-04-15 }}</ref>

''Clyster'' entered the English language in the late 14th century from Old French or Latin, from Greek κλυστήρ (klyster), "syringe", itself from κλύζειν (klyzein), "to wash out",<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.etymonline.com/search?q=clyster |title=clyster (n.) |work=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]] |publisher=Douglas Harper of the [[LNP Media Group]] |access-date=2019-12-29 }}</ref> also spelled ''glister'' in the 18th century,<ref>{{cite book |author=[[Benjamin Rush]] |title=Medical observations and inquiries |volume=3 |year=1769 |pages=250, 251, 252 |work=By a Society of Physicians in London |location=[[London]] |url=https://archive.org/details/s9id13413710/ |access-date=2022-01-22 |edition=The Second }}</ref> is a generally archaic word used more particularly for enemas administered using a ''clyster syringe''.

=== Ancient and medieval ===
==== Africa ====

The first mention of the enema in medical literature is in the Ancient Egyptian [[Ebers Papyrus]] ({{circa|1550}} BCE). One of the many types of medical specialists was an Iri, the Shepherd of the Anus. Many medications were administered by enemas.<ref>Magner, ''A History of Medicine'':31</ref> There was a Keeper of the Royal Rectum<ref>Magner, ''A History of Medicine'':30</ref> who may have primarily been the pharaoh's enema maker. The god [[Thoth]], according to Egyptian mythology, invented the enema.<ref>Magner, ''A History of Medicine'':26</ref>

[[File:Afrikanische Holzplastik.jpg|thumb|Pressure enema from an animal bladder (African wooden sculpture, 19th century)]]

In parts of Africa the [[calabash]] gourd is used traditionally to administer enemas. On the Ivory Coast the narrow neck of the gourd filled with water is inserted the patient's rectum and the contents are then injected by means of an attendant's forcible oral inflation, or, alternatively, a patient may self-administer the enema by using suction to create a negative pressure in the gourd, placing a finger at the opening, and then upon anal insertion, removing the finger to allow atmospheric pressure to effect the flow. Along the upper Congo River an enema apparatus is made by making a hole in one end of the gourd for filling it, and using a resin to attach a hollow cane to the gourd's neck. The cane is inserted into the anus of the patient who is in a posture that allows gravity to effect infusion of the fluid.<ref>Friedenwald & Morrison, 'Part I:75-76</ref>

==== Americas ====

The [[Olmec]] from their middle preclassic period (10th through 7th centuries BCE) through the Spanish Conquest used trance-inducing substances ceremonially, and these were ingested via, among other routes, enemas administered using jars.

As further described below in [[Enema#Religious rituals|religious rituals]], the [[Maya civilization|Maya]] in their late classic age (7th through 10th centuries CE) used enemas for, at least, ritual purposes, Mayan sculpture and ceramics from that period depicting scenes in which, injected by syringes made of gourd and clay, ritual hallucinogenic enemas were taken.<ref name=Hallucinogenic_pre-Columbian>{{cite journal |title=Hallucinogenic drugs in pre-Columbian Mesoamerican cultures |volume=30 |issue=1 |pages=42–49 |author=F.

For combating illness and discomfort of the digestive tract, the Mayan also employed enemas, as documented during the colonial period, e.g., in the [[Florentine Codex]].<ref name=Hallucinogenic_pre-Columbian/>

The [[indigenous peoples of the Americas#North America|indigenous peoples of North America]] employed [[tobacco smoke enema]]s to stimulate respiration, injecting the smoke using a rectal tube.<ref>{{Citation |last1 = Hurt |first1 = Raymond |last2 = Barry |first2 = J.

A rubber bag connected with a conical nozzle, at an early period, was in use among the [[indigenous peoples of the Americas#South America|indigenous peoples of South America]]  as an enema syringe,<ref>Friedenwald & Morrison, Part II:261</ref> and the rubber enema bag with a connecting tube and ivory tip remained in use by them while in Europe a syringe was still the usual means for conducting an enema.<ref>Friedenwald & Morrison, Part II:240</ref>

==== Asia ====

In Babylonia, by 600 BCE, enemas were in use, although it appears that initially they were in use because of a belief that the demon of disease would, by means of an enema, be driven out of the body.<ref name=History_Asia_Misc>Friedenwald & Morrison, Part I:77</ref> Babylonian and Assyrian tablets c. 600 BCE bear cuneiform inscriptions referring to enemas.<ref name=Comparative_Clinical_Study>{{cite journal |last1=Page |first1=Sidney G. |title=A Comparative Clinical Study of Several Enemas |journal=Journal of the American Medical Association |date=2 April 1955 |volume=157 |issue=14 |pages=1208–1210 |doi=10.1001/jama.1955.02950310034008 |pmid=14353661 }}</ref>

In China, c. 200 CE, [[Zhang Zhongjing]]<!--->Redirected from Chang Chung-ching, the name used in the reference---> was the first to employ enemas. "Secure a large pig's bile and mix with a small quantity of vinegar. Insert a bamboo tube three or four inches long into the rectum and inject the mixture" are his directions, according to [[Wu Lien-teh]].<ref>Friedenwald & Morrison, 'Part I:77–80</ref>

In India, in the fifth century BCE, [[Sushruta]] enumerates the enema syringe among 121 surgical instruments described. Early Indian physicians' enema apparatus consisted of a tube of bamboo, ivory, or horn attached to the scrotum of a deer, goat, or ox.<ref name=History_Asia_Misc/>

In Persia, [[Avicenna]] (980–1037 A. D.) is credited with the introduction of the "clyster-purse" or collapsible portion of an enema outfit made from ox skin or silk cloth and emptied by squeezing with the hands.<ref name=Comparative_Clinical_Study/>

==== Europe ====
[[File:The Enema MET DP818226.jpg|thumb|''The Enema'' by [[Abraham Bosse]], ca. 1632–33]]
[[Hippocrates]] (460–370 BCE) frequently mentions enemas, e.g., "if the previous food which the patient has recently eaten should not have gone down, give an enema if the patient be strong and in the prime of life, but if he be weak, a suppository should be administered, should the bowels be not well moved on their own accord."<ref>Friedenwald & Morrison, 'Part I:71</ref>

In the first century BCE the [[Ancient Greek medicine|Greek physician]] [[Asclepiades of Bithynia]] wrote "Treatment consists merely of three elements: drink, food, and the enema".<ref>Scarborough, ''The Drug Lore of ASCLEPIADES of Bithynia'':44</ref> Also, he contended that indigestion is caused by particles of food that are too big and his prescribed treatment was proper amounts of food and wine followed by an enema which would remove the improper food doing the damage.<ref>Scarborough, ''The Drug Lore of ASCLEPIADES of Bithynia'':46</ref>

In the second century CE the Greek physician [[Soranus (Greek physician)|Soranus]] prescribed, among other [[Surgery in Ancient Rome|techniques]], enemas as a safe [[abortion]] method,<ref>{{cite book|author=Soranus|translator=Owsei Temkin |title=Soranus' Gynecology|date=1956|publisher=JHU Press|pages=62–67|isbn=9780801843204}}</ref> and the Greek philosopher [[Celsus]] recommended an enema of pearl barley in milk or rose oil with butter as a nutrient for those with dysentery and unable to eat,<ref name=Royal_Pharmaceutical>{{cite web |url=http://www.rpharms.com/museum-pdfs/21-enemas.pdf |title = Information Sheet:21 Enemas |website = Information Sheets |publisher = Museum of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society, London |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306155528/https://www.rpharms.com/museum-pdfs/21-enemas.pdf |archive-date=2016-03-06 |access-date=2020-01-03 }}</ref> and also Galen mentions enemas in several contexts.<ref name=Galen>{{Citation |last = Mattern |first = Susan P. |year = 2008 |title = Galen and the Rhetoric of Healing |publisher = [[Johns Hopkins University Press]] |location = Johns Hopkins University Press, Maryland, USA |isbn=978-0-8018-8835-9 |pages = 31, 145, 149 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=5IXlOC1_liEC }}</ref>

In medieval times appear the first illustrations of enema equipment in the [[Western world]], a clyster syringe consisting of a tube attached to a pump action bulb made of a pig bladder.{{Citation needed|date=July 2020}}
A simple piston [[syringe]] clyster was in use from the 15th through 19th centuries. This device had its rectal nozzle connected to a syringe with a plunger rather than to a bulb.{{Citation needed|date=July 2020}}

In 1753 an enema bag prepared from a pig's or beef's bladder attached to a tube was described by Johann Jacob Woyts as an alternative to a syringe.<ref>Friedenwald & Morrison, Part II:245</ref>

In the 18th century Europeans began emulating the [[indigenous peoples of the Americas#North America|indigenous peoples of North America's]] use of tobacco smoke enemas to resuscitate drowned people.<ref name=BCMJ>{{cite web |url=https://www.bcmj.org/special-feature/special-feature-tobacco-smoke-enemas |title=Special feature: Tobacco smoke enemas |author=Sterling Haynes |date=December 2012 |work=British Columbia Medical Journal |publisher=Doctors of BC |access-date=2019-03-29 }}</ref> Tobacco resuscitation kits consisting of a pair of bellows and a tube were provided by the Royal Humane Society of London and placed at various points along the Thames.<ref name=Royal_Pharmaceutical /> Furthermore, these enemas came to be employed for headaches, respiratory failure, colds, hernias, abdominal cramps, typhoid fever, and cholera outbreaks.<ref name=BCMJ/>

Clysters were a favourite medical treatment in the [[bourgeoisie]] and [[nobility]] of the Western world up to the 19th century. As medical knowledge was fairly limited at the time, purgative clysters were used for a wide variety of [[ailment]]s, the foremost of which were [[stomach ache]]s and constipation.<ref name="Pharmacological treatment">{{cite journal |last1=Clemens |first1=Katri E. |last2=Faust |first2=Markus |last3=Jaspers |first3=Birgit |last4=Mikus |first4=Gerd |title=Pharmacological treatment of constipation in palliative care |journal=Current Opinion in Supportive & Palliative Care |date=June 2013 |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=183–191 |doi=10.1097/SPC.0b013e32835f1e17 |pmid=23478431 |s2cid=3283246 }}</ref>

According to [[Louis de Rouvroy, duc de Saint-Simon|the duc de Saint-Simon]], clysters were so popular at the court of King [[Louis XIV of France]] that [[Marie Adélaïde of Savoy|the duchess of Burgundy]] had her servant give her a clyster in front of the King (her modesty being preserved by an adequate posture) before going to the [[comedy]]. However, he also mentions the astonishment of the King and Mme de Maintenon that she should take it before them.<ref>Saint-Simon, ''Memoires'', vol. 10, [http://rouvroy.medusis.com/docs/1004.html ch. 4].</ref>

In the 19th century many new types of enema administration equipment were devised. Devices allowing gravity to infuse the solution, like those mentioned above used by South American indigenous people and like the enema bag described by Johann Jacob Woyts, came into common use. These consist of a nozzle at the end of a hose which connects a reservoir, either a bucket or a rubber bag, which is filled with liquid and held or hung above the recipient.<ref name=Royal_Pharmaceutical />

=====Kellogg's enemas=====

In the late 19th century Dr. [[John Harvey Kellogg]] made sure that the bowel of each and every patient was plied with water, from above and below. His favorite device was an enema machine ("just like one I saw in Germany") that could run fifteen gallons of water through a person's bowel in a matter of seconds. Every water enema was followed by a pint of yogurt—half was eaten, the other half was administered by enema "thus planting the protective germs where they are most needed and may render most effective service." The yogurt served to replace "the intestinal flora" of the bowel, creating what Kellogg claimed was a completely clean intestine.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.museumofquackery.com/amquacks/kellogg.htm |title=Dr. John Harvey Kellogg |website=Great American Quacks |publisher=Museum of Quackery |access-date=12 February 2018}}</ref>

=== Recreational usage ===

[[File:Inflatable enema nozzle in harness 01.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1|This nozzle (shown here in harness) can be inflated to a diameter wider than a rectum to force holding in an enema that could not otherwise be retained. Used either for pleasure or as part of [[BDSM]] activities.]]

==== Pleasure ====
{{Main|Klismaphilia}}
Enjoyment of enemas is known as [[klismaphilia]], which medically is classified as a [[paraphilia]].<ref>[http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20080224093721/http://www.psychologytoday.com/conditions/paraphilias.html Paraphilias] from [http://www.psychologytoday.com Psychology Today]</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Denko|first=JD.|date=April 1973|title=Klismaphilia: enema as a sexual preference.

Both women and men may enjoy sexual enema play, heterosexually and homosexually, experiencing [[sexual arousal]] from enemas which they find gratifying or sensual<ref name="Agnew, 1982">Agnew, 1982</ref><ref name="Denko"/> and which can be an auxiliary to, or even a substitute for, genital [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]].<ref name="Agnew, 1982"/><ref name="Denko">{{cite journal|last=Denko|first=JD.|date=April 1976|title=Amplification of the erotic enema deviance|journal=Am J Psychother|volume=30|pages=236–55 | issue=2|pmid=937588|doi=10.1176/appi.psychotherapy.1976.30.2.236}}</ref>

Klismaphiles may perceive pleasure from a large, water distended belly or the feeling of internal pressure. An enema fetish may include the sexual attraction to the equipment, processes, environments, situations, or scenarios,<ref>Brame et al., ''Different loving – The World of Sexual Dominance and Submission'':517</ref> Klismaphiles can gain satisfaction of enemas through fantasies, by actually receiving or giving one, or through the process of eliminating steps to being administered one (e.g., under the pretence of being constipated).<ref name="Denko"/>

That some women use enemas while masturbating was documented by [[Alfred Kinsey]] in ''Sexual Behavior in the Human Female'': "There were still other masturbatory techniques which were regularly or occasionally employed by some 11 percent of the females in the sample... Douches, streams of running water, vibrators, urethral insertions, enemas, other anal insertions, sado-masochistic activity, and still other methods were occasionally employed, but none of them in any appreciable number of cases."<ref>{{Citation | last1 = Kinsey | first1 = Alfred Charles | title = Sexual Behavior in the Human Female | publisher = Indiana University Press | place = Bloomington, Indiana, U.S.A. | year = 1953 | isbn = 978-0-253-33411-4 }}</ref>

==== Other sexually related uses ====
Besides klismaphilia, the intrinsic enjoyment of enemas, there are other uses of enemas in sexual play.<ref name=Agnew_page_76|Agnew>, ''Klismaphilia'':76</ref>

===== BDSM =====

[[File:5000 ml Enema Bag with Dildo Nozzle Filled Hanging in Tree.jpg|thumb|right|upright|A filled 5 litre enema bag connected to a bored [[dildo]], ready to inject into a recipient on the ground beneath.]]

Enemas are sometimes used in [[sadomasochism|sadomasochistic]] activities<ref>Brame et al., ''Different loving – The World of Sexual Dominance and Submission'':513,516</ref><ref>Agnew, 2000:74,77,78,79</ref> for [[erotic humiliation]]<ref>Brame et al., ''Different loving – The World of Sexual Dominance and Submission'':515,516,520</ref> or for physical discomfort.<ref>Brame et al., ''Different loving – The World of Sexual Dominance and Submission'':513,517</ref>

===== Rectal douching =====
{{Main|Rectal douching}}
Another sexual use for enemas is to empty the rectum as a prelude to other anal sexual activities such as [[anal sex]],<ref name="Agnew, 2000:76">Agnew, 2000:76</ref> possibly reducing risk of infection.

This is different from klismaphilia, in which the enema is enjoyed for itself and as a part of sexual arousal and gratification.<ref name="Agnew, 2000:76"/>

=== Punitive usage ===

Enemas have also been forcibly applied as a means of punishment.

In the vastly influential Argentine text [[Facundo|''Facundo, or Civilization and Barbarism'']], for example, [[Domingo Faustino Sarmiento]] describes the use of [[Chili pepper|pepper]] and [[turpentine]] enemas by police forces as a way of discouraging political dissent in post-independence Argentina.<ref>"Ribbons and Rituals".
