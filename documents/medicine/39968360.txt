{{short description|Resistance of vaccination}}
[[File:Immune response2.svg|thumb|right|300px|The time-course of an immune response begins with the initial pathogen encounter, (or initial vaccination) and leads to the formation and maintenance of active immunological memory.]]
'''Vaccine-naive''' is a lack of immunity, or [[Immunity (medical)|immunologic memory]], to a [[disease]] because the person has not been [[vaccination|vaccinated]]. There are a variety of reasons why a person may not have received a vaccination, including contraindications due to preexisting medical conditions, lack of resources, previous vaccination failure, religious beliefs, personal beliefs, fear of side-effects, phobias to needles, lack of information, vaccine shortages, physician knowledge and beliefs, social pressure, and natural resistance.<ref name=guidance >{{Cite journal

==Effect on herd immunity==
[[Infectious disease|Communicable diseases]], such as [[measles]] and [[influenza]], are more readily spread in vaccine-naive populations, causing frequent outbreaks. Vaccine-naive persons threaten what epidemiologists call [[herd immunity]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Kiera Butler |url=https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2013/05/vaccines-whooping-cough |title=The Real Reason Kids Aren't Getting Vaccines |publisher=Mother Jones |date=2013-05-27 |access-date=2013-07-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6033a3.htm |title=Prevention and Control of Influenza with Vaccines: Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), 2011 |publisher=Cdc.gov |access-date=2013-07-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=West|first1=D.
