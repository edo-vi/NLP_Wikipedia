'''Heart valve dysplasia''' is a congenital [[heart]] defect which affects the aortic, pulmonary, mitral, and tricuspid [[heart valve]]s.  Dysplasia of the mitral and tricuspid valves can cause leakage of blood or [[stenosis]].{{cn|date=February 2021}}

Dysplasia of the mitral and tricuspid valves - also known as the atrioventricular (AV) valves - can appear as thickened, shortened, or notched valves.  The [[chordae tendineae|chordae tendinae]] can be fused or thickened.  The [[papillary muscle]]s can be enlarged or [[atrophy|atrophied]].  The cause is unknown, but [[genetics]] play a large role.  Dogs and cats with tricuspid valve dysplasia often also have an open [[foramen ovale (heart)|foramen ovale]], an [[atrial septal defect]], or inflammation of the right atrial [[epicardium]].<ref name=Ettinger_1995>{{cite book|author1=Ettinger, Stephen J. |author2=Feldman, Edward C. |title=Textbook of Veterinary Internal Medicine|edition=4th|publisher=W.B. Saunders Company|year=1995|isbn=978-0-7216-6795-9}}</ref>  In dogs, tricuspid valve dysplasia can be similar to [[Ebstein's anomaly]] in humans.<ref name=Abbott_2000>{{cite book|author=Abbott, Jonathan A.|title=Small Animal Cardiology Secrets|edition=1st|publisher=Hanley & Belfus, Inc.|year=2000|isbn=978-1-56053-352-8}}</ref>

Mitral valve stenosis is one of the most common congenital heart defects in cats.  In dogs, it is most commonly found in [[Great Dane]]s, [[German Shepherd Dog]]s, [[Bull Terrier]]s, [[Golden Retriever]]s, [[Newfoundland (dog)|Newfoundland]]s, and [[English Mastiff|Mastiff]]s.  Tricuspid valve dysplasia is most common in the [[Old English Sheepdog]], German Shepherd Dog, [[Weimaraner]], [[Labrador Retriever]], [[Pyrenean Mountain Dog|Great Pyrenees]],<ref name=Ettinger_1995/> and sometimes the [[Papillon (dog)|Papillon]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} It is inherited in the Labrador Retriever.<ref name=Famula>{{cite journal |vauthors=Famula T, Siemens L, Davidson A, Packard M |title=Evaluation of the genetic basis of tricuspid valve dysplasia in Labrador Retrievers |journal=Am J Vet Res |volume=63 |issue=6 |pages=816â€“20 |year=2002 |pmid=12061526 |doi=10.2460/ajvr.2002.63.816}}</ref>

The disease and symptoms are similar to progression of acquired valve disease in older dogs.  Valve leakage leads to heart enlargement, [[Heart arrhythmia|arrhythmia]]s, and [[heart failure|congestive heart failure]].  Heart valve dysplasia can be tolerated for years or progress to heart failure in the first year of life.  Diagnosis is with an [[echocardiography|echocardiogram]].  The [[prognosis]] is poor with significant heart enlargement.{{cn|date=February 2021}}
