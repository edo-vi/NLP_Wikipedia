'''Clark Stanley''' (b. {{circa|1854}} in [[Abilene, Texas]], according to himself; the town was founded in 1881) was an American herbalist and [[Quackery|quack doctor]] who marketed a "[[snake oil]]" as a [[patent medicine]], styling himself the "Rattlesnake King" until his fraudulent products were exposed in 1916, popularizing the pejorative title of the "snake oil salesman".

Stanley claimed that, starting in 1879, after eleven years working as a cowboy, he studied for more than two years with a [[Hopi]] medicine man at [[Walpi, Arizona]].<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Aiw-KntGPrgC&q=hopi+indians+clark+stanley&pg=PA75 |title = Rattlesnakes|isbn = 9780292770232|last1 = Frank Dobie|first1 = J.|year = 1982| publisher=University of Texas Press }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2013/08/26/215761377/a-history-of-snake-oil-salesmen|title=A History Of 'Snake Oil Salesmen'|website=NPR.org|date=26 August 2013 |last1=Gandhi |first1=Lakshmi }}</ref> This supposedly included learning the "secrets of snake oil".  With the help of a Boston druggist he began marketing his product at Western [[medicine show]]s.  In 1893 he and his rattlesnakes gained attention at the [[World's Columbian Exposition]] in [[Chicago, Illinois]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2013/08/26/215761377/a-history-of-snake-oil-salesmen,|title=A History of 'Snake Oil Salesmen'|website=NPR |date=26 August 2013 |last1=Gandhi |first1=Lakshmi }}</ref>  Later he went on to establish production facilities in [[Beverly, Massachusetts]] and [[Providence, Rhode Island]].

In 1916, subsequent to the passage of the [[Pure Food and Drug Act]] in 1906, Stanley's concoction was examined and found to be of no value. It was found to contain [[mineral oil]], a fatty compound thought to be from beef, [[capsaicin]] from chili peppers, and [[turpentine]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-Og7AAAAYAAJ&q=%22snake+oil%22&pg=PA592|title=Service and Regulatory Announcements|last=Chemistry|first=United States Bureau of|date=1917|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office|language=en}}</ref>  He was fined $20.00 (approximately to $470 in 2019).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.in2013dollars.com/1916-dollars-in-2019?amount=20 |title=Inflation Calculator |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=August 2019 |website=In2013dollars.com |access-date=4 August 2019}}</ref> The term "snake oil" would go on to become a popular [[euphemism]] for ineffective or fraudulent products, particularly those marketed as medicines or cures.
