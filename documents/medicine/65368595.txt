{{short description|Vaccine administered via the nose}}
A '''nasal vaccine''' is a [[vaccine]] administered through the nose that stimulates an immune response without an injection. It induces immunity through the [[Nasal mucosa|inner surface of the nose]], a surface that naturally comes in contact with many [[Airborne transmission|airborne microbes]].<ref name="Scherließ2014">{{cite book|last=Scherließ|first=Regina|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SfSSBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA287|title=Subunit Vaccine Delivery|publisher=Springer|year=2014|isbn=978-1-4939-1417-3|editor-last=Foged|editor-first=Camilla|pages=287–306|chapter=15.

==History==
Nasal inoculation dates as far back as the 17th century in China during the [[Kangxi Emperor]]’s reign. Documentation during this period indicates that the Kangxi Emperor vaccinated his family, army, and others for mild smallpox. Manuals detailing vaccination techniques at the time all focused on sending smallpox up the nose of the individual being vaccinated. Although other vaccination techniques were developed using an infected individual’s scabs, a common method was to place a cotton swab with the fluid from an infected person’s pustule up the nose.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Boylston |first=Arthur |date=July 2012 |title=The origins of inoculation |journal=Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine |language=en |volume=105 |issue=7 |pages=309–313 |doi=10.1258/jrsm.2012.12k044 |issn=0141-0768 |pmc=3407399 |pmid=22843649}}</ref>

Following smallpox, influenza became a prominent focus for nasal vaccine development. The first [[Live attenuated influenza vaccine|live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV)]] in the form of a nasal spray was created in Russia by the [[Institute of Experimental Medicine]] in 1987. This nasal vaccine development was based on the Russian backbone of LAIV while nasal vaccines since then have been based on other LAIV backbones.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal |last1=Rudenko |first1=Larisa |last2=Yeolekar |first2=Leena |last3=Kiseleva |first3=Irina |last4=Isakova-Sivak |first4=Irina |date=October 2016 |title=Development and approval of live attenuated influenza vaccines based on Russian master donor viruses: Process challenges and success stories |journal=Vaccine |language=en |volume=34 |issue=45 |pages=5436–5441 |doi=10.1016/j.vaccine.2016.08.018 |pmc=5357706 |pmid=27593158}}</ref> The first nasal influenza vaccine was released in the United States in 2001 but was taken off the market due to toxicity concerns.

==Administration==
Nasal vaccines are a subsection of mucosal immunization as they use a mucosal route for vaccine delivery. As many pathogens can enter the body through the nose, nasal vaccines take advantage of this mechanism to deliver the vaccine. The nose has multiple lines of defense to prevent pathogens from entering further into the body. Nasal hairs are the first defense as they are at the entrance of the nose and prevent large particles from entering. The mucus layer in the nasal cavity can trap smaller particles that get past the nose hairs.<ref name=":3">{{Cite journal |last1=Yusuf |first1=Helmy |last2=Kett |first2=Vicky |date=2017-01-02 |title=Current prospects and future challenges for nasal vaccine delivery |journal=Human Vaccines & Immunotherapeutics |language=en |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=34–45 |doi=10.1080/21645515.2016.1239668 |issn=2164-5515 |pmc=5287317 |pmid=27936348}}</ref> The nasal cavity has a large vascularization network so particles can go through the epithelial layer and directly enter the bloodstream.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Gras-Cabrerizo |first1=Juan R. |last2=García-Garrigós |first2=Elena |last3=Montserrat-Gili |first3=Joan R. |last4=Gras-Albert |first4=Juan R. |last5=Mirapeix-Lucas |first5=Rosa |last6=Massegur-Solench |first6=Humbert |last7=Quer-Agusti |first7=Miquel |date=2018-03-01 |title=Anatomical Correlation Between Nasal Vascularisation and the Design of the Endonasal Pedicle Flaps |url=https://doi.org/10.1007/s12070-017-1197-z |journal=Indian Journal of Otolaryngology and Head & Neck Surgery |language=en |volume=70 |issue=1 |pages=167–173 |doi=10.1007/s12070-017-1197-z |issn=0973-7707 |pmc=5807293 |pmid=29456964}}</ref> Intruding particles will interact with the mucosal immune system if they reach the nasal mucosa.

Nasal vaccines can come in different forms such as solutions (liquids), powders, gels, and solid inserts. The most prevalent type of nasal vaccine in research and clinical application is solutions due to its ease of use. Although solutions are usually pipetted into test subjects’ nostrils when conducting animal trials for nasal vaccines, nasal sprays are considered the most practical approach for mass human vaccination using nasal vaccines.<ref name=":3" /> A nasal spray is able to bypass the initial layers of the nasal mucosa and deliver the vaccine particles directly to the mucoadhesive layer.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Moakes |first1=Richard J.

Nasal sprays are commonly used for delivering drugs in addition to vaccines. Decongestant drugs are often directly delivered to the nose through nasal sprays. Cold and allergy medication can be administered using nasal sprays for local delivery by bypassing nasal hairs and being introduced to the nasal cavity. Intranasal administration can have less drug degradation compared to oral administration because of direct particle delivery. Peptide drugs used for hormone treatments can be delivered nasally through nasal sprays instead of orally to retain particle integrity. Nasal sprays can also be used to deliver diabetes treatment, steroids, and intranasal oxytocin to induce labor. Nasal administration is also used to deliver anesthetics and sedatives due to direct access to the mucosal immune system and bloodstream.<ref name=":4">{{Citation |title=Nasal administration |date=2023-03-18 |url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nasal_administration&oldid=1145251079 |work=Wikipedia |access-date=2023-04-14 |language=en}}</ref> 

The [[olfactory epithelium]] makes up approximately 7% of the surface area of the nasal cavity and is connected to the olfactory bulb in the brain. Drugs and vaccines can be delivered to the brain past the [[Blood–brain barrier|blood-brain barrier]] through olfactory nerve cells.<ref name=":4" /> 

Compared to injectable vaccines, nasal vaccines can be advantageous because they are safe, painless, and easy to use. Nasal vaccines do not require a needle, which eliminates pain from needlestick injuries and safety concerns due to cross-contamination and needle disposal. Some studies also show that intranasal vaccines can generate cross-reactive antibodies that could lead to cross-protection.<ref name=":3" />

==Live attenuated influenza vaccine==
{{main|Live attenuated influenza vaccine}}The live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) in the form of a nasal spray was one of the first nasal vaccines released on the market. Nasal spray LAIVs have been used since the late 1980s as an alternative to the injectable influenza vaccine.<ref name=":0" /> Nasal influenza vaccines have become popular as they reduce the risk of intramuscular injuries from administration and are painless.

An animal study on mice tested how a nasal vaccine can bypass issues with entry into the nasal epithelium by taking advantage of ciliary movement. The results indicated that tubulin tyrosine ligase-like family member 1 (Ttll1) knockout mice had higher levels of the vaccine antigen compared to the hetero mice.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Lan |first1=Huangwenxian |last2=Suzuki |first2=Hidehiko |last3=Nagatake |first3=Takahiro |last4=Hosomi |first4=Koji |last5=Ikegami |first5=Koji |last6=Setou |first6=Mitsutoshi |last7=Kunisawa |first7=Jun |date=August 2020 |title=Impaired mucociliary motility enhances antigen-specific nasal IgA immune responses to a cholera toxin-based nasal vaccine |url=https://academic.oup.com/intimm/article/32/8/559/5826838 |access-date=2023-04-14 |journal=International Immunology |volume=32 |issue=8 |pages=559–568 |doi=10.1093/intimm/dxaa029 |pmc=9262165 |pmid=32347929}}</ref>
