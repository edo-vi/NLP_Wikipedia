The influential [[Massachusetts]] preacher [[Cotton Mather]] was the first known person to attempt [[smallpox]] [[inoculation]] on a large scale, inoculating himself and more than two hundred members of his congregation with the help of a local doctor. While his view later became standard, there was a strong negative reaction against him at the time.<ref>Blake, John B. "The Inoculation Controversy in Boston: 1721-1722." 'New England Quarterly', vol. 25, no. 4, New England Quarterly, Inc., 1952, pp. 489–506, https://doi.org/10.2307/362582.</ref>

[[Rowland Hill (preacher)|Rowland Hill]] (1744–1833) was a popular English preacher acquainted with [[Edward Jenner]], the pioneer of smallpox [[vaccination]], and he encouraged the vaccination of the congregations he visited or preached to.<ref name="Bazin2000">{{cite book|author=H.

Later he became a member of the Royal Jennererian Society, which was established when vaccination was accepted in Britain, India, the US, and elsewhere. [[John C. Lettsom]], an eminent [[Religious Society of Friends|Quaker]] physician of the day wrote to Rowland Hill commenting:

Several [[Boston]] clergymen and devout physicians formed a society that opposed vaccination in 1798.<ref>David P. Mindell, The Evolving World: Evolution in Everyday Life (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 2007 [2006]), p. 10</ref> Others complained that the practice was dangerous, going so far as to demand that doctors who carried out these procedures be tried for attempted murder.<ref>{{cite book |chapter= Theological opposition to inoculation, vaccination, and the use of anæsthetics |title= A History of the Warfare of Science with Theology in Christendom |author= Andrew Dickson White |publisher=Appleton |year= 1896 |chapter-url=http://abob.libs.uga.edu/bobk/whitem10.html |access-date=2007-08-17}}</ref>

In 1816 Iceland made the clergy responsible for smallpox vaccination and gave them the responsibility of keeping vaccination records for their parishes; Sweden also had similar practices.<ref>{{cite book |author= Pétursson P |year=1983 |title= Church and Social Change: A Study of the Secularization Process in Iceland, 1830–1930 |series= Studies in religious experience and behaviour, nr. 4 |location= Helsingborg, Sweden |publisher= Plus Ultra |pages= 70, 79 |isbn=91-970355-9-9}}</ref>

When vaccination was introduced into [[United Kingdom|UK]] public policy, and adoption followed overseas, there was opposition from trade unionists and others, including sectarian ministers and those interested in self-help and alternative medicines like [[homeopathy]].<ref>Durbach, Nadja. 2005. ''Bodily matters: the anti-vaccination movement in England, 1853–1907''. Radical perspectives. Durham: Duke University Press. pp 40–45.</ref>

[[Anti-vaccinationists]] were most common in [[Protestant]] countries. Those who were religious often came from minority religious movements outside of mainstream Protestantism, including Quakers in England and [[Baptists]] in Sweden.<ref>Bourdelais, Patrice. 2006. ''Epidemics laid low: a history of what happened in rich countries''. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. pp. 25–26.</ref>

Catholic and Anglican missionaries vaccinated Northwest Coast Native Americans during an 1862 smallpox epidemic.<ref>{{Cite book |author= Boyd RW | title=The Coming of the Spirit of Pestilence: Introduced Infectious Diseases and Population Decline Among Northwest Coast Indians, 1774–1874 | year=1999 | publisher= University of Washington Press | location=Seattle |isbn=0-295-97837-6 |chapter= A final disaster: the 1862 smallpox epidemic in coastal British Columbia |pages=172–201}}</ref>

In the [[United Kingdom|UK]], a number of [[Vaccination Acts]] were introduced to control vaccination and inoculation, starting in 1840, when [[variolation|smallpox inoculation]] was banned. The 1853 Act introduced compulsory free infant vaccination enforced by local authorities. By 1871, infant vaccination was compulsory and parents refusing to have their child vaccinated were fined and imprisoned if the fines were not paid. Resistance to compulsion grew, and in 1889, after riots in [[Leicester]], a Royal Commission was appointed and issued six reports between 1892 and 1896. It recommended the abolition of cumulative penalties. This was done in an 1898 Act, which also introduced a conscience clause that exempted parents who did not believe vaccination was efficacious or safe. This extended the concept of the "[[conscientious objector]]" in English law.<!--see Talk and Hansard--> A further Act in 1907 made it easier to obtain exemption.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

[[Jehovah's Witnesses]] condemned the practice of vaccination in 1931 as "a direct violation of the everlasting covenant that God made with Noah after the flood",<ref>[[Dorit Rubinstein Reiss]], "Thou Shalt Not Take the Name of the Lord Thy God in Vain: Use and Abuse of Religious Exemptions from School Immunization Requirements", ''Hastings Law Journal'', Vol. 65, Iss. 6 (2013), p. 1583.</ref> but reversed that policy in 1952. The decision of whether to vaccinate themselves or their family is left to individuals. Some more recent Jehovah's Witness publications have mentioned the success of vaccination programs.<ref>[http://www.religioustolerance.org/witness6.htm About the Jehovah's Witnesses Christian denomination{{snd}}Past opposition to vaccinations], religioustolerance.org</ref>

The [[Use of fetal tissue in vaccine development|use of fetal tissue in the development of vaccines]] has also provoked some controversy among religions opposed to [[abortion]]. The cell culture media of some viral vaccines, and the virus of the [[rubella]] vaccine, are derived from tissues taken from aborted fetuses, leading to moral questions. For example, the [[principle of double effect]], originated by [[Thomas Aquinas]], holds that actions with both good and bad consequences are morally acceptable in specific circumstances, and the question is how this principle applies to vaccination.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.immunizationinfo.org/assets/files/pdfs/Moral_Considerations_With_Certain_Viral_Vaccines.pdf |title= Moral considerations with certain viral vaccines |author= Grabenstein JD |journal= Christ Pharm |issn=1094-9534 |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=3–6 |year=1999 |access-date=2009-05-11}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> The Vatican Curia has expressed concern about the rubella vaccine's embryonic cell origin, saying Catholics have "...{{nbs}}a grave responsibility to use alternative vaccines and to make a conscientious objection with regard to those which have moral problems".<ref name=Vatican>{{cite journal |author= Pontifical Academy for Life |title= Moral reflections on vaccines prepared from cells derived from aborted human foetuses |year= 2005 |journal= Medicina e Morale |publisher= Center for Bioethics, Catholic University of the Sacred Heart |url= http://www.academiavita.org/template.jsp?sez=Documenti&pag=testo/vacc/vacc&lang=english |access-date= 2008-12-03 |url-status= dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20060507072740/http://www.academiavita.org/template.jsp?sez=Documenti&pag=testo%2Fvacc%2Fvacc&lang=english |archive-date= 2006-05-07 }}</ref> The Vatican concluded that until an alternative becomes available it is acceptable for [[Catholic]]s to use the existing vaccine, writing, "This is an unjust alternative choice, which must be eliminated as soon as possible."<ref name=Vatican/>
