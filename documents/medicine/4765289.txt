'''''Simplexvirus bovinealpha2''''', also known as '''''Bovine alphaherpesvirus 2''''' (BoHV2) is a [[virus]] of the family ''[[Herpesviridae]]''. It causes two diseases in [[cattle]], '''bovine mammillitis''' and '''pseudo-lumpy skin disease'''.

== Pathology ==
Pseudo-lumpy skin disease was originally discovered in [[South Africa]] where a similar but more serious disease caused by a [[poxvirus]], [[lumpy skin disease]], is also prevalent.  Symptoms include fever and skin nodules on the face, back, and [[perineum]].  The disease heals within a few weeks.  Bovine mammillitis is characterized by lesions restricted to the [[teat]]s and [[udder]].  BoHV-2 probably spreads through an [[arthropod]] [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]],<ref name=Fenner_1993>{{cite book|author1=Fenner, Frank J. |author2=Gibbs, E. Paul J. |author3=Murphy, Frederick A. |author4=Rott, Rudolph |author5=Studdert, Michael J. |author6=White, David O. |title=Veterinary Virology (2nd ed.)|publisher=Academic Press, Inc|year=1993|isbn=978-0-12-253056-2}}</ref> but can also be spread through milkers and [[milking machine]]s.<ref name=Carter/>

A review publication from 2011 presents a series of controversial but scientifically based conclusions concerning the pathogenesis and epidemiology of the infection, among these that spread among cattle is preferably by the respiratory route, and that skin lesions result from viremic spread to epidermal foci and inflammation due to complement activation by the classical pathway at sites of virus propagation after formation of early antibody to BoHV2. Lesions may be aggravated by low skin temperature (e.g. in edematic or hairless skin areas) causing reduced blood circulation and hampered removal of cell-toxic inflammatory substances.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Bitsch |first1=Viggo |title=Epidemiology and pathogenesis of the Bovine herpesvirus 2 infection: Disease in response to initial antibody production |date=23 July 2011 |isbn=978-87-994685-0-8 |url=http://bovine-herpesvirus-2.blogspot.com/2011/07/bovine-herpesvirus-2.html}}</ref>

== Morphology ==
BoHV2 is similar in structure to human [[herpes simplex virus]].<ref name=Carter>{{cite web|author1=Carter, G.R. |author2=Flores, E.F. |author3=Wise, D.J. |year=2006|title=Herpesviridae|work=A Concise Review of Veterinary Virology| url=http://www.ivis.org/advances/Carter/Part2Chap11/chapter.asp?LA=1|access-date=2006-06-04}}</ref>
