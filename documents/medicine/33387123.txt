'''''[[Streptococcus]]''''' species are the cause of opportunistic infections in [[poultry]] leading to acute and chronic conditions in affected birds. Disease varies according to the Streptococcal species but common presentations include [[septicaemia]], [[peritonitis]], [[salpingitis]] and [[endocarditis]].

Common species affecting poultry include:
* ''S. gallinaceus'' in broiler chickens
* ''S. gallolyticus'' which is a pathogen of racing pigeons and turkey poults
* ''[[Streptococcus dysgalactiae|S. dysgalactiae]]'' in broiler chickens
* ''[[S. mutans]]'' in geese
* ''S. pluranimalium'' in broiler chickens
* ''[[Streptococcus zooepidemicus|S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus]]'' in chickens and turkeys
* ''[[S. suis]]'' in psittacine birds
__TOC__
==Diagnosis==
[[Post-mortem]] findings include friable internal organs, abdominal effusion and evidence of sepsis in the joints, heart valves and brain.<ref name="WikiVet">[http://en.wikivet.net/Streptococcus_%26_Enterococcus_Infections_-_Poultry Streptococcus and Enterococcus infections - Poultry] expert reviewed and published by [[WikiVet]], accessed 12 October 2011.</ref>

Bacteria can usually be [[microbiological culture|cultured]] from tissues collected at necropsy or identified by microscope examination.<ref name="WikiVet"/>

==Treatment and control==
The organism should be cultured and antibiotic sensitivity should be determined before treatment is started. [[Amoxycillin]] is usually effective in treating streptococcal infections.<ref name="WikiVet"/>

[[Biosecurity]] protocols and good hygiene are important in preventing the disease.<ref name="WikiVet"/>

[[Vaccination]] is available against ''S. gallolyticus'' and can also protect pigeons.<ref name="WikiVet"/>
