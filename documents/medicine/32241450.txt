'''Vaccine-induced seropositivity''' ('''VISP''') is the phenomenon wherein a person who has received a [[vaccine]] against a disease would thereafter give a positive or reactive test result for having that disease when tested for it, despite not actually having the disease.  This happens because many vaccines encourage the body to produce [[antibodies]] against a particular disease, and [[blood tests]] often determine whether a person has those antibodies, regardless of whether they came from the infection or just a vaccination.

VISP is especially a concern in [[vaccine trials]] for [[HIV vaccine]] research because people who give a positive result in an [[HIV test]], even if that result is because of a vaccine and not because of an infection, may face [[Discrimination against people with HIV/AIDS|discrimination because of HIV infection]].

==HIV==
===Background===
In 1987 in America the first HIV vaccine was tested.<ref>{{cite web|title=Clinical Trials of HIV Vaccines|url=http://www.niaid.nih.gov/topics/hivaids/understanding/prevention/Pages/clinicalStudies.aspx|work=National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases|access-date=7 February 2014}}</ref> HIV vaccines have been tested continually worldwide since then, but thus far, no one has developed any vaccine which reduces a person's risk of contracting HIV if exposed to that virus.{{cn|date=April 2021}}

Many HIV tests work not by checking a person's blood for HIV, but rather by determining whether the body's own antibodies against HIV are present in the blood.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}  Most HIV vaccines are designed with the intent to promote the body's own production of antibodies which would combat HIV.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}  Regardless of whether they are effective at stimulating the production of antibodies which fight HIV, they usually do cause the body to produce antibodies which standard HIV tests recognize as the antibodies which an HIV positive person would produce in response to HIV infection.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

A person who is HIV negative, and has received an HIV vaccine, and who then tests as positive in an HIV test is said to be positive because of VISP.{{citation needed|date=June 2020}}

===Significance===
When an HIV-negative person exhibits VISP and gets an HIV-positive result from a test then that person may have difficulty [[blood donation|donating blood]] or negotiating for a [[life insurance]] policy.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Van Braeckel | first1 = E. | last2 = Koutsoukos | first2 = M. | last3 = Bourguignon | first3 = P. | last4 = Clement | first4 = F.

Between 1987 and 2003 the number of persons who received experimental HIV vaccinations was about 10,000, and this number was considered small.  The difficulties in determining the difference between antibodies produced by HIV infection and vaccine-induced antibodies were managed by individual vaccine research sites who had special capability to conduct additional laboratory testing on this small pool of vaccine recipients.  However, at this time two new studies, the [[STEP Study]] in the US and the [[RV 144]] study in Thailand, greatly increased the number of people who received HIV vaccinations by another 4600 people.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ackers |first1=Marta-Louise |last2=Parekh |first2=Bharat |last3=Evans |first3=Thomas G. |last4=Berman |first4=Phillip |last5=Phillips |first5=Susan |last6=Allen |first6=Mary |year=2003 |title=Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Seropositivity among Uninfected HIV Vaccine Recipients |journal=[[The Journal of Infectious Diseases]] |volume=187 |issue=6 |pages=879–886 |publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]] |doi=10.1086/368169 |pmid=12660933 |url=http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/content/187/6/879.short |access-date=29 June 2011|doi-access=free }}</ref> There came to be an increased need to raise awareness of VISP because more people were exhibiting it.{{cn|date=April 2021}}

At the [[XVIII International AIDS Conference, 2010|2010 International AIDS conference]] presenters talked about the need for community healthcare providers to understand that if their patients have been in an HIV vaccine trial then their patients are likely to give a false positive HIV test result.<ref name="2010conference">{{cite web |url= http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/725432 |title=Antibodies Induced by HIV Vaccines May Give False-Positive HIV Test Results |first=Daniel M. |last=Keller |publisher=[[Medscape]] |work=medscape.com |date=20 July 2010 |access-date=28 June 2011}}</ref>

===HIV VISP in developing countries===
HIV vaccine research happens worldwide to ensure that any vaccine which researchers develop could be used for people worldwide.  In [[developing countries]] with limited access to healthcare, the problems associated with VISP are a special concern.{{cn|date=April 2021}}

Researchers from Africa, Asia, North America, and South America have said that getting local government and media support of the research is essential in addition to creating facilities for distinguishing between HIV positive individuals and individuals exhibiting VISP.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Lurie | first1 = P. | last2 = Bishaw | first2 = M. | last3 = Chesney | first3 = M.

===Likelihood===
People who participate in vaccine trials which test HIV vaccines may exhibit VISP for years or for the rest of their lives.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

A study done on participants in the [[HIV Vaccine Trials Network]] HIV vaccination studies showed that among 2176 HIV negative participants who received a vaccine, 908 (42%) had VISP.  However, the occurrence of VISP varied depending on what kind of vaccine the participants received.<ref>{{cite journal |first1=CJ |last1=Cooper |first2=B |last2=Metch |first3=J |last3=Dragavon |first4=RW |last4=Coombs |first5=LR |last5=Baden |date=21 July 2010 |title=Vaccine-induced HIV seropositivity/reactivity in noninfected HIV vaccine recipients. |journal=[[Journal of the American Medical Association]] |volume=304 |issue=3 |pages=275–83 |publisher=[[American Medical Association]] |doi= 10.1001/jama.2010.926|pmc= 3086635|pmid=20639561}}</ref>

==Hepatitis B==
When a person gets a [[hepatitis B vaccine]] then the most common test for hepatitis B will show them to be positive.  The usual course of action, in this case, is to give the person a panel of tests for [[HBsAg]], [[anti-HBc]], and [[anti-HBs]] (hepatitis B surface antigen, anti-hepatitis B core, and anti-hepatitis B surface).  A person who has never been exposed to hepatitis B but has gotten the vaccine will be positive for anti-HBs but negative for the other two tests in the panel.  Other combinations of positive and negative in this test can mean other things, such as acute, chronic, or past infection.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.who.int/csr/disease/hepatitis/whocdscsrlyo20022/en/index3.html#test |title=WHO &#124; Hepatitis B |work=who.int |publisher=[[World Health Organization]]|year=2011 |access-date=7 July 2011}} See the table "HBV serological markers in hepatitis patients"</ref>

==Other conditions==
VISP is not often a practical concern for other diseases because in most cases good vaccines already exist and most people who have access to healthcare receive them. Also physicians do not routinely test people for recent infections with most diseases as they do for HIV. Medical literature on VISP for most diseases is not widely available because there is little practical need for doing that research.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}
