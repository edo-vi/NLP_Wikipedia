'''World Immunization Week''' is a [[global health|global public health]] campaign to raise awareness and increase rates of [[immunization]] against [[vaccine-preventable diseases]] around the world. It takes place each year during the last week of April (24th - 30th).

Immunization can protect against 25 different infectious agents or diseases, from infancy to old age, including [[diphtheria]], [[measles]], [[pertussis]], [[polio]], [[tetanus]] and [[COVID-19]]. The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) estimates active immunization currently averts 2 to 3 million deaths every year. However, 22.6 million infants worldwide are still missing out on basic vaccines, mostly in developing countries.<ref>World Health Organization, [https://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs378/en/ Immunization coverage.] WHO Fact sheet N° 378, updated February 2014. Accessed 9 April 2014.</ref> Inadequate immunization coverage rates often result from limited resources, competing health priorities, poor management of [[health systems]] and inadequate surveillance. The goal of World Immunization Week is to [[raising awareness|raise public awareness]] of how immunization saves lives, and support people everywhere to get the vaccinations needed against deadly diseases for themselves and their children.{{cn|date=July 2023}}

World Immunization Week sprung out of the efforts taking place across different countries and regions for a week-long immunization awareness commemoration. World Immunization Week is one of eleven official campaigns marked by the WHO, along with [[World Health Day]], [[World Blood Donor Day]], [[World No Tobacco Day]], [[World Tuberculosis Day]], [[World Malaria Day]], [[World Patient Safety Day]], [[World Hepatitis Day]], World Antimicrobial Awareness Week, [[World Chagas Disease Day]] and [[World AIDS Day]].<ref>World Health Organization, [https://www.who.int/campaigns WHO campaigns.] Accessed 20 October 2020.</ref>
