'''''Equid gammaherpesvirus 2''''', formerly '''''Equine herpesvirus 2''''' (EHV-2), is a [[virus]] of the family ''[[Herpesviridae]]'', originally known as '''''equine cytomegalovirus''''' due to its slow replication in tissue culture.  However, complete sequencing of the EHV-2 genome has demonstrated that it is a member of the subfamily ''[[Gammaherpesvirinae]]'',<ref name=Telford_1995>{{cite journal|vauthors=Telford EA, Watson MS, Aird HC, Perry J, Davison AJ |title=The DNA sequence of equine herpesvirus 2|date =9 June 1995|journal=[[Journal of Molecular Biology]]|doi=10.1006/jmbi.1995.0314|volume=249|issue=3|pages=520â€“528 |pmid=7783207 }}</ref> in the genus ''[[Percavirus]]''.<ref name="ICTV"/> It has an uncertain role in respiratory disease in [[horse]]s, but EHV-2 has been isolated from cases exhibiting symptoms such as coughing, [[conjunctivitis]], and swollen [[submaxillary]] and [[parotid]] [[lymph node]]s.<ref name=Fenner_1993>{{cite book|author=Fenner, Frank J.|author2=Gibbs, E.
