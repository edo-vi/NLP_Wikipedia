{{short description|Condition in dogs due to not eating at night}}

'''Bilious vomiting syndrome''' in [[dog]]s is vomiting in response to [[bile]]-induced inflammation of the stomach.  It is also known as '''reflux gastritis syndrome''' and '''duodenal-gastric reflux'''.  Bile salts interfere with the [[gastric mucosal barrier]], allowing acid to irritate the stomach lining and cause [[gastritis]].<ref name=Westermarck_2003>{{cite journal|author1=Westermarck, Elias |author2=Wiberg, Maria |title=Canine gastritis|journal=The Veterinary Clinics of North America|year=2003|volume=33|pages=978–979}}</ref>

Dogs with this condition usually vomit in the morning after not eating all night.  Treatment is to feed late at night.  [[H₂-receptor antagonist|H2 blocker]]s and [[antiemetic]]s can also be used.  Bilious vomiting syndrome is a diagnosis of exclusion, meaning that the dog is normal otherwise and no other causes of the vomiting have been found.<ref name=Ettinger_1995>{{cite book|author1=Ettinger, Stephen J. |author2=Feldman, Edward C. |title=Textbook of Veterinary Internal Medicine|edition=4th|publisher=W.B.
