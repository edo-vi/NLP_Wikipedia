'''Systems medicine''' is an interdisciplinary field of study that looks at the systems of the human body as part of an integrated whole, incorporating biochemical, physiological, and environment interactions. Systems medicine draws on [[systems science]] and [[systems biology]], and considers complex interactions within the human body in light of a patient's [[genomics]], behavior and environment.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Federoff HJ, Gostin LO | title = Evolving from reductionism to holism: is there a future for systems medicine? | journal = JAMA | volume = 302 | issue = 9 | pages = 994–6 | date = September 2009 | pmid = 19724047 | doi = 10.1001/jama.2009.1264 }}</ref>

The earliest uses of the term ''systems medicine'' appeared in 1992, in an article on systems medicine and pharmacology by T. Kamada.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kamada T | title = System biomedicine: a new paradigm in biomedical engineering | journal = Frontiers of Medical and Biological Engineering | volume = 4 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–2 | date = 1992 | pmid = 1599879 }}</ref>

An important topic in systems medicine and [[systems biomedicine]] is the development of computational models that  describe disease progression and the effect of therapeutic interventions.<ref name="pmid16552630">{{cite journal | vauthors = de Winter W, DeJongh J, Post T, Ploeger B, Urquhart R, Moules I, Eckland D, Danhof M | title = A mechanism-based disease progression model for comparison of long-term effects of pioglitazone, metformin and gliclazide on disease processes underlying Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus | journal = Journal of Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics | volume = 33 | issue = 3 | pages = 313–43 | date = June 2006 | pmid = 16552630 | doi = 10.1007/s10928-006-9008-2 | s2cid = 21941015 }}</ref>

More recent approaches include the redefinition of disease phenotypes based on common mechanisms rather than symptoms. These provide then therapeutic targets including network pharmacology<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Oettrich JM, Dao VT, Frijhoff J, Kleikers P, Casas AI, Hobbs AJ, Schmidt HH | title = Clinical relevance of cyclic GMP modulators: A translational success story of network pharmacology | journal = Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics | volume = 99 | issue = 4 | pages = 360–2 | date = April 2016 | pmid = 26765222 | doi = 10.1002/cpt.336 | s2cid = 40005254 | url = https://cris.maastrichtuniversity.nl/en/publications/501d0909-5e77-427a-944a-a7b3cfae2d35 }}</ref> and [[drug repositioning|drug repurposing]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Langhauser F, Casas AI, Dao VT, Guney E, Menche J, Geuss E, Kleikers PW, López MG, Barabási AL, Kleinschnitz C, Schmidt HH | title = A diseasome cluster-based drug repurposing of soluble guanylate cyclase activators from smooth muscle relaxation to direct neuroprotection | journal = npj Systems Biology and Applications | volume = 4 | issue = 1 | pages = 8 | date = 2018-02-05 | pmid = 29423274 | pmc = 5799370 | doi = 10.1038/s41540-017-0039-7 }}</ref> Since 2018, there is a dedicated scientific journal,  ''Systems Medicine''.<ref>{{Cite journal| vauthors = Baumbach J, Schmidt HH |date=2018|title=The End of Medicine as We Know It: Introduction to the New Journal, Systems Medicine|journal=Systems Medicine|volume=1|pages=1–2|doi=10.1089/sysm.2017.28999.jba|doi-access=free}}</ref>

== Fundamental schools of systems medicine ==
Essentially, the issues dealt with by systems medicine can be addressed in two basic ways, molecular (MSM) and organismal systems medicine (OSM):<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Tretter |first1=F |last2=Löffler-Stastka |first2=H |title=Medical knowledge integration and "systems medicine": Needs, ambitions, limitations and options. |journal=Medical Hypotheses |date=December 2019 |volume=133 |pages=109386 |doi=10.1016/j.mehy.2019.109386 |pmid=31541780|s2cid=202718643 }}</ref><ref name="Tretter_2021">{{cite journal |last1=Tretter |first1=F |last2=Wolkenhauer |first2=O |last3=Meyer-Hermann |first3=M |last4=Dietrich |first4=JW |last5=Green |first5=S |last6=Marcum |first6=J |last7=Weckwerth |first7=W |title=The Quest for System-Theoretical Medicine in the COVID-19 Era. |journal=Frontiers in Medicine |date=2021 |volume=8 |pages=640974 |doi=10.3389/fmed.2021.640974 |pmid=33855036|pmc=8039135 |doi-access=free }}</ref>

=== Molecular systems medicine (MSM) ===
This approach relies on [[omics]] technologies ([[genomics]], [[proteomics]], [[transcriptomics]], [[phenomics]], [[metabolomics]] etc.) and tries to understand [[Physiology|physiological]] processes and the evolution of [[disease]] in a bottom-up strategy, i.e. by simulating, synthesising and integrating the description of molecular processes to deliver an explanation of an organ system or even the organism in its whole.

=== Organismal systems medicine (OSM) ===
This branch of systems medicine, going back to the traditions of [[Ludwig von Bertalanffy]]'s [[systems theory]] and [[biological cybernetics]] is a top-down strategy that starts with the description of large, complex processing structures (i.e. [[neural network]]s, [[feedback loop]]s and other [[Network motif|motif]]s) and tries to find sufficient and necessary conditions for the corresponding functional organisation on a molecular level.

A common challenge for both schools is the translation between the molecular and the organismal level. This can be achieved e.g. by affine subspace mapping and [[sensitivity analysis]], but also requires some preparative steps on both ends of the epistemic gap.<ref name="Tretter_2021"/>

=== Systems Medicine Education ===
Georgetown University is the first in the Nation to launch a MS program in Systems Medicine. It has developed a rigorous curriculum, The programs have been developed and led by Dr. Sona Vasudevan, PhD.
