{{short description|Temperature monitoring label placed on vaccine vials}}
A '''vaccine vial monitor''' ('''VVM''') is a [[Thermochromism|thermochromic]] label put on [[vials]] containing [[vaccines]] which gives a visual indication of whether the vaccine has been kept at a temperature which preserves its potency.  The labels were designed in response to the problem of delivering vaccines to [[developing countries]] where the [[cold chain]] is difficult to preserve, and where formerly vaccines were being rendered inactive and administered ineffectively due to their having been [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denatured]] by exposure to ambient temperature.

==History==
When international vaccine care standards were being designed in the 1970s, the manuals typically generalized from the needs of care for the oral polio vaccine since that was the most delicate vaccine in wide use.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Zaffran | first1 = M. | title = Vaccine transport and storage: Environmental challenges | journal = Developments in Biological Standardization | volume = 87 | pages = 9–17 | year = 1996 | pmid = 8853997}}</ref>

In the 1970s [[Program for Appropriate Technology in Health|PATH]] began working with the [[World Health Organization|WHO]] to develop a system for identifying vaccines which had expired from improper storage.  In 1996 the vaccine vial monitor was first used in a vaccine project, and by the next year it was widely accepted for use on many vaccine projects. It took until 2007 for VVMs to be widely adopted by vaccine manufacturers. by 2017, over 6.6 billion VVMs had been used. <ref>{{Cite web |title=Vaccine Vial Monitors: “The Little Big Thing:” Taking Social Innovation to Scale |url=https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/case-studies/vaccine-vial-monitors-little-big-thing-taking-social-innovation-scale |access-date=2023-09-18 |website=Stanford Graduate School of Business |language=en}}</ref>

In 2007 in [[Geneva]] the World Health Organization hosted a commemoration of the 10-year anniversary of the introduction of VVMs.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.who.int/immunization_standards/vaccine_quality/vvm_10years/en/index.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090616172046/http://www.who.int/immunization_standards/vaccine_quality/vvm_10years/en/index.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=June 16, 2009 |title=WHO celebrates 10 year anniversary of VVM implementation |work=who.int |access-date=1 July 2011}}</ref> In 2007 PATH won a [[Tech Award]] for the development of the VVM.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.techawards.org/laureates/stories/index.php?id=162 |title=The Tech Museum Awards - Technology Benefiting Humanity; Tech Award Laureates &#124; Laureate Stories |work=techawards.org |year=2007 |access-date=1 July 2011}}</ref>

==Use==
The vaccine vial monitor consists of a heat sensitive square within a circle.  If the monitor is exposed to heat it changes color with time and with increasing speed in hotter conditions.  If the square becomes the same color as the circle or becomes darker than the circle, then the vaccine contained in the vial is damaged and the vial should be discarded.<ref name="manual">{{cite web |url=https://www.who.int/vaccines-documents/DocsPDF00/www516.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031225091459/http://www.who.int/vaccines-documents/DocsPDF00/www516.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=December 25, 2003 |title=Making use of Vaccine Vial Monitors |date=April 2000 |work=www.who.int |publisher=[[World Health Organization]] Department of Vaccines and Biologicals |access-date=9 July 2011}}</ref>

Studies have shown that health workers without proper training sometimes do not understand what a VVM is or how it works.  A 2007 study in urban areas of [[Valsad]] in India showed that vaccine administrators were unaware of the purpose of the monitors.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Chudasama | first1 = R.

==Commonly monitored vaccines==
The vaccine vial monitor is intended for use on vaccines which may travel outside of the cold chain, but its use on certain vaccines has had an especially notable impact.{{cn|date=March 2022}}

===Hepatitis B===
Manufacturers recommend that [[hepatitis B vaccine]]s be stored at 2-8&nbsp;°C, but the vaccines actually tolerate ambient and even high temperatures for some amount of time.  The use of vaccine vial monitors has helped health workers remain confident in vaccines being stored outside the cold chain.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hipgrave |first1=David B. |last2=Maynard |first2=James E. |last3=Biggs |first3=Beverly-Ann |year=2006 |title=Improving birth dose coverage of hepatitis B vaccine |journal=Bull World Health Organ |volume=84 |issue=1 |pages=65–71 |issn=0042-9686 |doi=10.2471/blt.04.017426 |pmid=16501717 |url=http://www.scielosp.org/scielo.php?pid=S0042-96862006000100016&script=sci_abstract |access-date=9 July 2011|pmc=2626514}}</ref>

===Polio vaccine===
The World Health Organization has described VVMs as crucial in the spread of [[Polio vaccine|polio vaccination]] programs.<ref>{{cite journal | last1=Aylward | first1=R.

==Comparable technology==
Electronic time–temperature indicators can detect all temperature changes, including issues of freezing vaccines which heat-detecting VVMs would not detect.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Zweig | first1 = S. | title = Advances in vaccine stability monitoring technology | journal = Vaccine | volume = 24 | issue = 33–34 | pages = 5977–5985 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16759766 | doi = 10.1016/j.vaccine.2006.05.007 |url=https://zenodo.org/record/848823}}</ref>
