'''''Mycoplasma synoviae''''' is a species of bacterium in the genus ''[[Mycoplasma]]''. It causes disease in the joints, bones and respiratory system of [[birds]]. It is found throughout the world and infection may be referred to as infectious synovitis, avian mycoplasmosis, infectious sinusitis, or mycoplasma arthritis. It is of economic importance because infection can cause a drop in egg production. The disease is most commonly seen in [[chickens]], and transmission occurs both [[Vertical transmission|vertically]] and [[Horizontal transmission|horizontally]].

==Clinical signs & diagnosis==
Common clinical signs include [[lameness]], a stiff gait, and abnormal curvature of the limbs. Respiratory and neurological signs are also reported. As mentioned, a drop in [[egg production]] often occurs.

A preliminary diagnosis can be made based on history, clinical exam, and postmortem signs. [[Bacterial culture]], [[immunofluorescence]], [[Polymerase chain reaction|PCR]], [[ELISA]], or slide agglutination tests (SAT) can be used to make a more definitive diagnosis.

==Treatment & control==
''Mycoplasma synoviae'' is treated with [[antibiotics]], but resistance to some types is reported. Specific antibiotic treatment is available for [[Egg (biology)|eggs]].

The disease is controlled with [[vaccination]].
