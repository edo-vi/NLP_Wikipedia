'''''Immunisation against infectious disease''''', popularly known as '''''The Green Book''''', provides information on vaccines for [[vaccine-preventable diseases]]. It acts as a guide to the [[vaccination schedule#United Kingdom|UK's vaccination schedule]] for health professionals and health departments that give vaccines in the United Kingdom.

The first two editions were published in 1992 and 1996. A third edition in 2006, was the last to appear in print. Updates have since been added by its clinical editors through advice and recommendations from the [[Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation]] (JCVI) and appear only online as individual chapters via the immunisation section of the GOV.UK website. As of 2021 it includes updates on [[COVID-19]].
