[[File:Herd immunity.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|The top box shows an outbreak in a community in which a few people are infected (shown in red) and the rest are healthy but unimmunized (shown in blue); the illness spreads freely through the population. The middle box shows a population where a small number have been immunized (shown in yellow); those not immunized become infected while those immunized do not. In the bottom box, a large proportion of the population have been immunized; this prevents the illness from spreading significantly, including to unimmunized people. In the first two examples, most healthy unimmunized people become infected, whereas in the bottom example only one fourth of the healthy unimmunized people become infected.]]

<!-- Definition -->
'''Herd immunity''' (also called '''herd effect''', '''community immunity''', '''population immunity''', or '''mass immunity''') is a form of indirect protection that applies only to [[contagious disease]]s. It occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population has become [[Immunity (medical)|immune]] to an infection, whether through previous infections or [[vaccination]],<ref>{{Cite web|title=Herd immunity {{!}} immunology|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/herd-immunity|access-date=2021-06-13|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en}}</ref> thereby reducing the likelihood of infection for individuals who lack immunity.<ref name="pmid21427399">{{cite journal|vauthors=Fine P, Eames K, Heymann DL|title="Herd immunity": a rough guide|journal=Clinical Infectious Diseases|volume=52|issue=7|pages=911–6|date=April 2011|pmid=21427399|doi=10.1093/cid/cir007|doi-access=free}}</ref><ref name="gordis">{{cite book|vauthors=Gordis L|year=2013|title=Epidemiology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7YX6AQAAQBAJ&pg=PA26|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|pages=26–27|isbn=978-1455742516|access-date=29 March 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Cold-Causing Coronaviruses Don't Seem to Confer Lasting Immunity|url=https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/cold-causing-coronaviruses-dont-seem-to-confer-lasting-immunity-67832|access-date=2021-01-26|website=The Scientist Magazine®|language=en|archive-date=7 January 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210107031858/https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/cold-causing-coronaviruses-dont-seem-to-confer-lasting-immunity-67832|url-status=live}}</ref>

The theoretical basis for herd immunity generally assumes that vaccines induce solid immunity, that populations mix at random, that the pathogen does not evolve to evade the immune response, and that there is no non-human vector for the disease.<ref name="pmid21427399"/>

==Theoretical basis==
{{See also|Basic reproduction number}}
{{Further|Mathematical modelling of infectious disease}}
{{herd_immunity_threshold_vs_r0.svg}}

The critical value, or threshold, in a given population, is the point where the disease reaches an [[Mathematical modelling of infectious disease#Endemic steady state|endemic steady state]], which means that the infection level is neither growing nor declining [[Exponential growth|exponential]]ly. This threshold can be calculated from the [[effective reproduction number]] ''R''<sub>e</sub>, which is obtained by taking the product of the [[basic reproduction number]] ''R''<sub>0</sub>, the average number of new infections caused by each case in an entirely susceptible population that is homogeneous, or well-mixed, meaning each individual is equally likely to come into contact with any other susceptible individual in the population,<ref name="pmid15627236"/><ref name="pmid24175217"/><ref name="pmid19197342"/> and ''S'', the proportion of the population who are susceptible to infection, and setting this product to be equal to 1:{{cn|date=May 2023}}

: <math> R_0 \cdot S=1. </math>

''S'' can be rewritten as (1 − ''p''), where ''p'' is the proportion of the population that is immune so that ''p'' + ''S'' equals one. Then, the equation can be rearranged to place ''p'' by itself as follows:{{cn|date=May 2023}}

: <math> R_0 \cdot (1-p)=1, </math>
: <math> 1-p=\frac {1} {R_0}, </math>
: <math> p_c=1 - \frac {1} {R_0}. </math>

With ''p'' being by itself on the left side of the equation, it can be renamed as ''p''<sub>c</sub>, representing the critical proportion of the population needed to be immune to stop the transmission of disease, which is the same as the "herd immunity threshold" HIT.<ref name=pmid15627236/> ''R''<sub>0</sub> functions as a measure of contagiousness, so low ''R''<sub>0</sub> values are associated with lower HITs, whereas higher ''R''<sub>0</sub>s result in higher HITs.<ref name=pmid24175217/><ref name=pmid19197342/> For example, the HIT for a disease with an ''R''<sub>0</sub> of 2 is theoretically only 50%, whereas a disease with an ''R''<sub>0</sub> of 10 the theoretical HIT is 90%.<ref name=pmid24175217/>

When the effective reproduction number ''R''<sub>e</sub> of a contagious disease is reduced to and sustained below 1 new individual per infection, the number of cases occurring in the population gradually decreases until the disease has been eliminated.<ref name=pmid15627236/><ref name=pmid24175217/><ref name=dabmago>{{cite book|vauthors=Dabbaghian V, Mago VK|date=2013|title=Theories and Simulations of Complex Social Systems|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AdLBBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA134|publisher=Springer|pages=134–35|isbn=978-3642391491|access-date=29 March 2015|archive-date=1 May 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210501053021/https://books.google.com/books?id=AdLBBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA134|url-status=live}}</ref> If a population is immune to a disease in excess of that disease's HIT, the number of cases reduces at a faster rate, outbreaks are even less likely to happen, and outbreaks that occur are smaller than they would be otherwise.<ref name=pmid21427399/><ref name=pmid15627236/> If the effective reproduction number increases to above 1, then the disease is neither in a steady state nor decreasing in [[Incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]], but is actively spreading through the population and infecting a larger number of people than usual.<ref name=pmid20667876/><ref name=dabmago/>

An assumption in these calculations is that populations are homogeneous, or well-mixed, meaning that every individual is equally likely to come into contact with any other individual, when in reality populations are better described as social networks as individuals tend to cluster together, remaining in relatively close contact with a limited number of other individuals.

In heterogeneous populations, ''R''<sub>0</sub> is considered to be a measure of the number of cases generated by a "typical" infectious person, which depends on how individuals within a network interact with each other.<ref name=pmid21427399/> Interactions within networks are more common than between networks, in which case the most highly connected networks transmit disease more easily, resulting in a higher ''R''<sub>0</sub> and a higher HIT than would be required in a less connected network.<ref name=pmid21427399/><ref name=pmid20667876/> In networks that either opt not to become immune or are not immunized sufficiently, diseases may persist despite not existing in better-immunized networks.<ref name=pmid20667876/>

===Overshoot===
The cumulative proportion of individuals who get infected during the course of a disease outbreak can exceed the HIT. This is because the HIT does not represent the point at which the disease stops spreading, but rather the point at which each infected person infects fewer than one additional person on average. When the HIT is reached, the number of additional infections does not immediately drop to zero. The excess of the cumulative proportion of infected individuals over the theoretical HIT is known as the '''overshoot'''.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Handel A, Longini IM, Antia R|title=What is the best control strategy for multiple infectious disease outbreaks?|journal=Proceedings.

However, right at this inflection point, the maximum number of infecteds is present. These infecteds will create on average less than 1, but still more than zero further infections, leading to additional depletion of susceptibles and therefore causing an overshoot.}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Fung IC, Antia R, Handel A|title=How to minimize the attack rate during multiple influenza outbreaks in a heterogeneous population|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=7|issue=6|pages=e36573|date=11 June 2012|pmid=22701558|pmc=3372524|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0036573|bibcode=2012PLoSO...736573F|doi-access=free}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|vauthors=Bergstrom CT, Dean N|date=1 May 2020|title=Opinion: What the Proponents of 'Natural' Herd Immunity Don't Say|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/01/opinion/sunday/coronavirus-herd-immunity.html|access-date=30 May 2020|archive-date=3 June 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200603150038/https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/01/opinion/sunday/coronavirus-herd-immunity.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

Assuming a vaccine is 100% effective, then the equation used for calculating the herd immunity threshold can be used for calculating the vaccination level needed to eliminate a disease, written as ''V''<sub>c</sub>.<ref name=pmid21427399/> Vaccines are usually imperfect however, so the effectiveness, ''E'', of a vaccine must be accounted for:

: <math> V_c=\frac {1 - \frac {1} {R_0}}{E}. </math>

From this equation, it can be observed that if ''E'' is less than (1 − 1/''R''<sub>0</sub>), then it is impossible to eliminate a disease, even if the entire population is vaccinated.<ref name=pmid21427399/> Similarly, waning vaccine-induced immunity, as occurs with [[DPT vaccine#Combination vaccines with acellular pertussis|acellular pertussis vaccines]], requires higher levels of booster vaccination to sustain herd immunity.<ref name=pmid21427399/><ref name=pmid25560446/> If a disease has ceased to be endemic to a population, then natural infections no longer contribute to a reduction in the fraction of the population that is susceptible. Only vaccination contributes to this reduction.<ref name=pmid15627236/> The relation between vaccine coverage and effectiveness and disease incidence can be shown by subtracting the product of the effectiveness of a vaccine and the proportion of the population that is vaccinated, ''p''<sub>v</sub>, from the herd immunity threshold equation as follows:
[[File:Measles cases coverage eastern mediterranean.jpg|right|thumb|Measles vaccine coverage and reported measles cases in [[Eastern Mediterranean]] countries. As coverage increased, the number of cases decreased.]]
: <math> \left(1 - \frac {1} {R_0}\right) - (E \times p_v). </math>

It can be observed from this equation that, all other things being equal ("''[[ceteris paribus]]''"), any increase in either vaccine coverage or vaccine effectiveness, including any increase in excess of a disease's HIT, further reduces the number of cases of a disease.<ref name=pmid15627236/> The rate of decline in cases depends on a disease's ''R''<sub>0</sub>, with diseases with lower ''R''<sub>0</sub> values experiencing sharper declines.<ref name=pmid15627236/>

Vaccines usually have at least one [[contraindication]] for a specific population for medical reasons, but if both effectiveness and coverage are high enough then herd immunity can protect these individuals.<ref name=pmid23910028/><ref name=pmid22773718/><ref name=tulvar/> Vaccine effectiveness is often, but not always, adversely affected by passive immunity,<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Leuridan E, Sabbe M, Van Damme P|title=Measles outbreak in Europe: susceptibility of infants too young to be immunized|journal=Vaccine|volume=30|issue=41|pages=5905–13|date=September 2012|pmid=22841972|doi=10.1016/j.vaccine.2012.07.035}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Hodgins DC, Shewen PE|title=Vaccination of neonates: problem and issues|journal=Vaccine|volume=30|issue=9|pages=1541–59|date=February 2012|pmid=22189699|doi=10.1016/j.vaccine.2011.12.047}}</ref> so additional doses are recommended for some vaccines while others are not administered until after an individual has lost his or her passive immunity.<ref name=pmid21293327/><ref name=tulvar/>

Individual immunity can also be gained passively, when [[Antibody|antibodies]] to a pathogen are transferred from one individual to another. This can occur naturally, whereby [[Mother#Biological mother|maternal]] antibodies, primarily [[immunoglobulin G]] antibodies, are transferred across the [[Placenta#Immunity|placenta]] and in [[colostrum]] to fetuses and newborns.<ref name=pmid20956021>{{cite journal|vauthors=Chucri TM, Monteiro JM, Lima AR, Salvadori ML, Kfoury JR, Miglino MA|title=A review of immune transfer by the placenta|journal=Journal of Reproductive Immunology|volume=87|issue=1–2|pages=14–20|date=December 2010|pmid=20956021|doi=10.1016/j.jri.2010.08.062}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Palmeira P, Quinello C, Silveira-Lessa AL, Zago CA, Carneiro-Sampaio M|title=IgG placental transfer in healthy and pathological pregnancies|journal=Clinical & Developmental Immunology|volume=2012|pages=985646|year=2012|pmid=22235228|pmc=3251916|doi=10.1155/2012/985646|doi-access=free}}</ref> Passive immunity can also be gained artificially, when a susceptible person is injected with antibodies from the [[Serum (blood)|serum]] or [[Blood plasma|plasma]] of an immune person.<ref name=pville/><ref name=parija>{{cite book|vauthors=Parija SC|year=2014|title=Textbook of Microbiology & Immunology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bA9tAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA88|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|pages=88–89|isbn=978-8131236246|access-date=30 March 2015|archive-date=1 May 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210501053035/https://books.google.com/books?id=bA9tAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA88|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Cost–benefit analysis==
Herd immunity is often accounted for when conducting [[Cost–benefit analysis|cost–benefit analyses]] of vaccination programs. It is regarded as a [[Externality#Positive|positive externality]] of high levels of immunity, producing an additional benefit of disease reduction that would not occur had no herd immunity been generated in the population.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Bärnighausen T, Bloom DE, Cafiero-Fonseca ET, O'Brien JC|title=Valuing vaccination|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=111|issue=34|pages=12313–9|date=August 2014|pmid=25136129|pmc=4151736|doi=10.1073/pnas.1400475111|bibcode=2014PNAS..11112313B|doi-access=free}}</ref><ref name=pmid23072714>{{cite journal|vauthors=Deogaonkar R, Hutubessy R, van der Putten I, Evers S, Jit M|title=Systematic review of studies evaluating the broader economic impact of vaccination in low and middle income countries|journal=BMC Public Health|volume=12|pages=878|date=October 2012|pmid=23072714|pmc=3532196|doi=10.1186/1471-2458-12-878 |doi-access=free }}</ref> Therefore, herd immunity's inclusion in cost–benefit analyses results both in more favorable cost-effectiveness or cost–benefit ratios, and an increase in the number of disease cases averted by vaccination.<ref name=pmid23072714/> Study designs done to estimate herd immunity's benefit include recording disease incidence in households with a vaccinated member, randomizing a population in a single geographic area to be vaccinated or not, and observing the incidence of disease before and after beginning a vaccination program.<ref name=pmid23357859>{{cite journal|vauthors=Jit M, Newall AT, Beutels P|title=Key issues for estimating the impact and cost-effectiveness of seasonal influenza vaccination strategies|journal=Human Vaccines & Immunotherapeutics|volume=9|issue=4|pages=834–40|date=April 2013|pmid=23357859|pmc=3903903|doi=10.4161/hv.23637}}</ref> From these, it can be observed that disease incidence may decrease to a level beyond what can be predicted from direct protection alone, indicating that herd immunity contributed to the reduction.<ref name=pmid23357859/> When [[#Serotype replacement|serotype replacement]] is accounted for, it reduces the predicted benefits of vaccination.<ref name=pmid23072714/>

==History==

Herd immunity was recognized as a naturally occurring phenomenon in the 1930s when it was observed that after a significant number of children had become immune to [[measles]], the number of new infections temporarily decreased.<ref name="pmid15106084">* {{cite journal |vauthors=Hinman AR, Orenstein WA, Papania MJ |date=May 2004 |title=Evolution of measles elimination strategies in the United States |journal=The Journal of Infectious Diseases |volume=189 |issue=Suppl 1 |pages=S17-22 |doi=10.1086/377694 |pmid=15106084 |doi-access=free}}<br />*{{cite journal |vauthors=Sencer DJ, Dull HB, Langmuir AD |date=March 1967 |title=Epidemiologic basis for eradication of measles in 1967 |journal=Public Health Reports |volume=82 |issue=3 |pages=253–6 |doi=10.2307/4592985 |jstor=4592985 |pmc=1919891 |pmid=4960501}}</ref> Mass vaccination to induce herd immunity has since become common and proved successful in preventing the spread of many infectious diseases.<ref name="pmid15627236" /> [[Vaccine hesitancy|Opposition to vaccination]] has posed a challenge to herd immunity, allowing preventable diseases to persist in or return to populations with inadequate vaccination rates.<ref name="pmid22926181" /><ref name="pmid23584253" /><ref name="pmid23807359" />

The exact herd immunity threshold (HIT) varies depending on the [[basic reproduction number]] of the disease. An example of a disease with a high threshold was the measles, with a HIT exceeding 95%.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=van Boven M, Kretzschmar M, Wallinga J, O'Neill PD, Wichmann O, Hahné S |date=November 2010 |title=Estimation of measles vaccine efficacy and critical vaccination coverage in a highly vaccinated population |journal=Journal of the Royal Society, Interface |volume=7 |issue=52 |pages=1537–44 |doi=10.1098/rsif.2010.0086 |pmc=2988255 |pmid=20392713}}</ref>

The term "herd immunity" was first used in 1894 by American veterinary scientist and then Chief of the Bureau of Animal Industry of the US Department of Agriculture [[Daniel Elmer Salmon]] to describe the healthy vitality and resistance to disease of well-fed herds of hogs. In 1916 veterinary scientists inside the same Bureau of Animal Industry used the term to refer to the immunity arising following recovery in cattle infected with brucellosis, also known as "contagious abortion." By 1923 it was being used by British bacteriologists to describe experimental epidemics with mice, experiments undertaken as part of efforts to model human epidemic disease. By the end of the 1920s the concept was used extensively - particularly among British scientists - to describe the build up of immunity in populations to diseases such as diphtheria, scarlet fever, and influenza.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Robertson |first1=David |title=Of Mice and Schoolchildren: A Conceptual History of Herd Immunity |journal=American Journal of Public Health |date=10 June 2021 |volume=111 |issue=8 |pages=e1–e8 |doi=10.2105/AJPH.2021.306264 |pmid=34111938 |pmc=8489650 |s2cid=235404539 }}</ref> Herd immunity was recognized as a naturally occurring phenomenon in the 1930s when A. W. Hedrich published research on the [[epidemiology]] of measles in [[Baltimore]], and took notice that after many children had become immune to measles, the number of new infections temporarily decreased, including among susceptible children.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Hedrich AW | year = 1933 | title = Monthly Estimates of the Child Population Susceptible to Measles, 1900–1931, Baltimore, Md. | url = | journal = American Journal of Epidemiology | volume = 17 | issue = 3| pages = 613–636 | doi = 10.1093/oxfordjournals.aje.a117929 }}</ref><ref name="pmid15106084" /> In spite of this knowledge, efforts to control and eliminate measles were unsuccessful until mass vaccination using the [[measles vaccine]] began in the 1960s.<ref name="pmid15106084" /> Mass vaccination, discussions of disease eradication, and cost–benefit analyses of vaccination subsequently prompted more widespread use of the term ''herd immunity''.<ref name="pmid21427399" /> In the 1970s, the theorem used to calculate a disease's herd immunity threshold was developed.<ref name="pmid21427399" /> During the [[Smallpox#Eradication|smallpox eradication campaign]] in the 1960s and 1970s, the practice of ''[[ring vaccination]]'', to which herd immunity is integral, began as a way to immunize every person in a "ring" around an infected individual to prevent outbreaks from spreading.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Strassburg MA|title=The global eradication of smallpox|journal=American Journal of Infection Control|volume=10|issue=2|pages=53–9|date=May 1982|pmid=7044193|doi=10.1016/0196-6553(82)90003-7}}</ref>

Since the adoption of mass and ring vaccination, complexities and challenges to herd immunity have arisen.<ref name=pmid21427399/><ref name="pmid22561998"/> Modeling of the spread of infectious disease originally made a number of assumptions, namely that entire populations are susceptible and well-mixed, which is not the case in reality, so more precise equations have been developed.<ref name=pmid21427399/> In recent decades, it has been recognized that the dominant strain of a microorganism in circulation may change due to herd immunity, either because of herd immunity acting as an evolutionary pressure or because herd immunity against one strain allowed another already-existing strain to spread.<ref name=pmid21310617/><ref name=pmid22903767/> Emerging or ongoing fears and controversies about vaccination have reduced or eliminated herd immunity in certain communities, allowing preventable diseases to persist in or return to these communities.<ref name=pmid22926181/><ref name=pmid23584253/><ref name=pmid23807359/>
