[[File:Ebola Outbreak Map (ongoing).png|thumb|The [[RVSV-ZEBOV vaccine#History|struggle to get access to vaccine]] in the [[Western African Ebola virus epidemic|2013-2016 Ebola epidemic]] was primarily socio-economic, not technical]]
[[Vaccine]] development and production is economically complex and prone to [[market failure]]. Many of the diseases most demanding a vaccine, including [[HIV]], [[malaria]] and tuberculosis, exist principally in poor countries. Pharmaceutical firms and [[biotechnology]] companies have little incentive to develop vaccines for these diseases because there is little revenue potential. Even in more affluent countries, financial returns are usually minimal and the financial and other risks are great.<ref name="market_return">{{cite news | first=Jesse L. | last=Goodman | name-list-style = vanc | title=Statement by Jesse L.

==Market concentration==
While vaccine research and development is done by many small companies,<ref name=BB>{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-13/this-oslo-facility-may-be-the-key-to-the-coronavirus-vaccine | title=The Road to a Coronavirus Vaccine Runs Through Oslo | website=[[Bloomberg News]] | author=Peter Coy | date=13 February 2020 | accessdate=7 March 2020}}</ref> large-scale vaccine manufacturing is done by an [[oligopoly]] of big manufacturers.<ref name=BB/><ref name=Big_pharma/><ref>{{cite news |last1=Patrick |first1=Kate |title=FDA commissioner decries drug industry oligopoly |url=https://www.supplychaindive.com/news/fda-commissioner-decries-drug-industry-oligopoly/ |work=Supply Chain Dive}}</ref> A March 2020 [[New York Times]] article described the political effects of this market structure: "government and international health organizations know that any vaccine developed in a lab will ultimately be manufactured by large pharmaceutical firms. At this critical juncture with coronavirus, no health expert would publicly criticize drug companies, but privately they complain that pharma is a major speed bump in developing lifesaving vaccines."<ref name=Big_pharma>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/02/opinion/contributors/pharma-vaccines.html | title=Big Pharma May Pose an Obstacle to Vaccine Development | date=2 March 2020 | accessdate=8 March 2020 | newspaper=[[New York Times]] | author=Gerald Posner | quote=Drug companies on CEPI's scientific advisory panel, including Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer, and Japan's Takeda, pushed back. CEPI mostly capitulated in a December 2018 two-page declaration in which it jettisoned specifics but gave lip service to its founding mission of "equitable access to these vaccines for affected populations during outbreaks."| author-link=Gerald Posner }}</ref>

Concentration and monopolization of the manufacture of specific drugs has also led to supply shortages, and significant healthcare costs for employing people to track down hard-to-get drugs.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Vaillancourt |first1=R |title=Drug shortages: what can hospital pharmacists do? |journal=The Canadian Journal of Hospital Pharmacy |date=May 2012 |volume=65 |issue=3 |pages=175–9 |doi=10.4212/cjhp.v65i3.1138 |pmid=22783027 |pmc=3379822 }}</ref>

This oligopoly power allows{{citation needed|date=May 2020}} vaccine manufacturers to engage in [[price discrimination]], and vaccine prices are often two orders of magnitude higher than the manufacturer's stated manufacturing costs, {{as of|lc=yes|2015}}. Sales agreements often require that the buyer keeps the price secret and agrees to other non-competitive restrictions; the exact nature and extent of this problem is hard to characterize, due to agreements being secret.<ref name=right_shot/><ref>{{cite web |title=GAVI money welcome but could it be more wisely spent?|url=https://www.msf.org/gavi-money-welcome-could-it-be-more-wisely-spent |website=Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) International |language=en}}</ref> Price secrecy also disadvantages vaccine purchasers in price negotiations. It also makes market analysis difficult and hinders efforts to improve affordability.<ref name=right_shot/>

The first decade of the 2000s saw a large number of mergers and acquisitions, and {{as of|lc=yes|2010}}, 80% of the global vaccine market was in the hands of five multinationals: [[GlaxoSmithKline]], [[Sanofi Pasteur]], [[Pfizer]], [[Merck Group|Merck]], and [[Novartis]].<ref name="market">{{cite web |last1=Kaddar |first1=Miloud |title=Global Vaccine Market Features and Trends |url=https://www.who.int/influenza_vaccines_plan/resources/session_10_kaddar.pdf |publisher=World Health Organization}}</ref> Of these, Novartis does not focus on vaccine development.<ref name=establishing>{{cite journal | title=Establishing a Global Vaccine-Development Fund | journal=[[The New England Journal of Medicine]] | date=23 July 2015 | author1=Stanley A.

==Epidemic response==
In the past, the market power of pharmaceutical companies has delayed responses to epidemics. Manufacturers have successfully negotiated favourable terms, including market guarantees and [[indemnification]], from governments, as a condition of manufacturing vaccines. This has delayed responses to some epidemics by months, and prevented responses to other pandemics entirely.<ref name=Big_pharma/> Some intellectual property issues also hinder vaccine development for epidemic preparedness, as in [[RVSV-ZEBOV vaccine#History|the case of rVSV-ZEBOV]].<ref name=response>{{cite web |title=MSF's response to CEPI's policy regarding equitable access |url=https://msfaccess.org/msfs-response-cepis-policy-regarding-equitable-access |website=Médecins Sans Frontières Access Campaign |date=25 September 2018 |language=en}}</ref>

==Market incentives==
There is also no business incentive for pharmaceutical companies to test vaccines that are only of use to poor people.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Belluz |first1=Julia |title=A guide to the vaccines and drugs that could fight coronavirus |url=https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2020/3/4/21154590/coronavirus-vaccine-treatment-covid-19-drug-cure |work=Vox |date=4 March 2020 |language=en}}</ref> Vaccines developed for rich countries may also have short expiry dates,
and requirements that they be [[cold chain|refrigerated until they are injected]] and given in multiple shots, all of which may be very difficult in remote areas. In some cases it has simply never been tested whether the vaccine will still be effective if the requirements are not followed (say, if it retains potency for several days unrefrigerated).<ref name="right_shot">{{cite web |title=The Right Shot: Bringing down barriers to affordable and adapted vaccines - 2nd Ed., 2015 |url=https://msfaccess.org/right-shot-bringing-down-barriers-affordable-and-adapted-vaccines-2nd-ed-2015 |website=Médecins Sans Frontières Access Campaign |date=20 January 2015 |language=en}}</ref>

In almost all cases, pharmaceuticals including vaccines are developed with public funding, but profits and control of price and availability are legally accorded to private companies.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Mazzucato |first1=Mariana |last2=Momenghalibaf |first2=Azzi |title=Drug Companies Will Make a Killing From Coronavirus |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/18/opinion/coronavirus-vaccine-cost.html |work=The New York Times |date=18 March 2020}}</ref> The profits of large pharmaceutical companies are mostly used on dividends and share buybacks, which inflate executive pay,<ref name=CEOs/><ref name=financialized/> and on lobbying and advertising.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Lerner |first1=Sharon |title=Big Pharma Prepares to Profit From the Coronavirus |url=https://theintercept.com/2020/03/13/big-pharma-drug-pricing-coronavirus-profits/ |work=The Intercept |date=13 March 2020}}</ref><ref name=financialized/><ref name=no_innov/> Innovation is generally bought along with the small companies that developed it, rather than produced in-house;<ref name=CEOs>{{cite news |last1=Lazonick |first1=William |last2=Tulum |first2=Öner |title=How High Drug Prices Inflate C.E.O.s' Pay |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/26/opinion/drug-pricing-senate-hearing.html |work=The New York Times |date=26 February 2019}}</ref><ref name=financialized>{{cite journal |last1=Tulum |first1=Öner |last2=Lazonick |first2=William |title=FINANCIALIZED CORPORATIONS IN A NATIONAL INNOVATION SYSTEM: THE US PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY |journal=International Journal of Political Economy |date=February 2019 |url=http://www.theairnet.org/v3/backbone/uploads/2019/02/Tulum-Lazonick.FCINIS-20190215.pdf}}</ref><ref name=no_innov>{{cite web |title=Analysis: Large pharma companies do little new drug innovation |url=https://www.statnews.com/2019/12/10/large-pharma-companies-provide-little-new-drug-development-innovation/ |website=STAT |date=10 December 2019}}</ref> low percentage R&D spending is sometimes touted as an attraction to investors.<ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Vara |first1=Vauhini |title=Billions and Billions for Botox |url=https://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/actavis-allergan-botox-sale |magazine=The New Yorker |language=en}}</ref> The financialization focus of the pharmaceutical industry, especially in the US, has been cited as an obstacle to innovation.<ref name=financialized/>

== Demand ==
While the vaccine market makes up only 2-3% of the pharmaceutical market worldwide, it is growing at 10-15% per year, much faster than other pharmaceuticals ({{as of|lc=yes|2010}}).<ref name="market"/>
Vaccine demand is increasing with new target population in emerging markets (partly due to international vaccine funders;<ref name=right_shot/> in 2012, [[UNICEF]] bought half of the world's vaccine doses<ref name="market"/>). Vaccines are becoming the financial driver of the pharmaceutical industry, and new business models may be emerging. Vaccines are newly being marketed like pharmaceuticals.<ref name="market"/>

Vaccines offer new opportunities for funding from [[public-private partnerships]] (such as [[Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations|CEPI]]<ref name=Big_pharma/><ref name=norway>{{cite web |title=Norway has invested 200 million euros in epidemic preparedness, but are they getting what they're paying for? |url=https://msfaccess.org/norway-has-invested-200-million-euros-epidemic-preparedness-are-they-getting-what-theyre-paying |website=Médecins Sans Frontières Access Campaign |date=7 March 2019 |language=en}}</ref> and [[GAVI]]<ref name="ethnograph">{{cite journal |last1=Storeng |first1=Katerini T. |title=The GAVI Alliance and the 'Gates approach' to health system strengthening |journal=Global Public Health |date=14 September 2014 |volume=9 |issue=8 |pages=865–879 |doi=10.1080/17441692.2014.940362 |pmid=25156323 |pmc=4166931 |issn=1744-1692}}</ref>), governments, and [[philanthropic]] donors and foundations (such as GAVI and CEPI's donors<ref name=Big_pharma/><ref name="ethnograph"/>).

== Public domain ==

Baker (2016) observed that the vast majority of the cost of most diagnostic, preventive and treatment procedures are patent royalties:  The unit costs are almost universally a tiny fraction of the price to the consumer.  Moreover, in the US "the government spends more than $30 billion a year on biomedical research through the
National Institutes of Health".  And researchers (individuals and organizations) routinely obtain patents on products whose development was paid for by taxpayers, per the [[w:Bayh–Dole Act|Bayh–Dole Act]] of 1980.  Baker claims that the US population would have better health care at lower cost if the results of that research were all placed in the public domain.<ref>{{cite Q|Q100216001}}<!-- Rigged: How globalization and the rules to the modern economy were structured to make the rich richer -->.</ref>

Moreover, the cost of those diagnostic, preventive and treatment procedures would be lower the world over if the results of publicly-funded research were in the public domain.  This would likely lead to better control of infectious diseases worldwide.  That, in turn, would likely reduced the disease load in the US.<ref>See also the 2021-02-23 interview with Baker in "[[v:Unrigging the media and the economy]]".</ref>
