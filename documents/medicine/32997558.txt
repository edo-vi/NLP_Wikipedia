'''''Edwardsiella ictaluri''''' (also known as ''' enteric septicaemia of catfish''', '''hole in the head disease'''<ref>This term is also used for [[head and lateral line erosion]], an unrelated disease affecting many aquarium fish species.</ref> and '''ESC''') is a member of the family [[Hafniaceae]]. The bacterium is a short, [[gram negative]], [[pleomorphism (microbiology)|pleomorphic]] rod with flagella. It causes the disease enteric septicaemia of [[catfish]] (ESC), which infects a variety of fish species (including many catfish species, [[Gymnotiformes|knifefish]] and [[Barb (fish)|barbs]]). The bacteria can cause either acute [[septicaemia]] or chronic [[encephalitis]] in infected fish. Outbreaks normally occur in spring and autumn.

''Edwardsiella ictaluri'' can be found in [[Asia]] and the [[United States]], being of particular economic importance in the U.S. It is not a [[zoonosis]].

==Clinical signs and diagnosis==
Acute ESC infection causes an acute septicaemia that presents as multiple [[petechia|petechial haemorrhages]] that develop into depigmented [[Ulcer (dermatology)|ulcers]]. Additional clinical signs include abnormal behavior, [[exophthalmos]], [[hemorrhagic gastroenteritis]], [[edema]] and [[ascites]]. Chronic ESC infection causes a chronic [[encephalitis]]. Clinical signs include abnormal behavior, abnormal swimming patterns, swelling and [[Ulcer (dermatology)|ulceration]] of the head and death.

Any fish that survive the infection become latent [[asymptomatic carrier|carriers]] of the disease.

A presumptive diagnosis can be made based on the clinical signs alone but [[Polymerase chain reaction|PCR]], indirect [[immunofluorescence]], [[bacterial culture]] and [[ELISA]] can be used to definitively diagnose the disease.

==Treatment and control==
Several [[antibiotics]] can be used to treat the disease, but there are reports of [[antibiotic resistance|resistance]] emerging. [[Vaccination]] can be used to prevent disease. Management factors such as reducing stocking density and stress should be considered.
