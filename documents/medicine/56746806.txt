The '''2017–2018 South African listeriosis outbreak''' was a widespread outbreak of [[Listeriosis|''Listeria monocytogenes'' food poisoning]] that resulted from contaminated [[processed meats]] produced by [[Enterprise Foods]], a subsidiary of [[Tiger Brands]],<ref name="BI-2018-03-04">{{cite news |last=de Wet |first=Phillip |title=Tiger Brands' R2.2 billion processed meat business catches fire as listeriosis is traced to its Polokwane facility |work=[[Business Insider]] South Africa |date=4 March 2018 |access-date=6 March 2018 |url=https://www.businessinsider.co.za/tiger-brands-catches-listeriosis-from-enterprise-2018-3 |archive-date=5 March 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180305062911/https://www.businessinsider.co.za/tiger-brands-catches-listeriosis-from-enterprise-2018-3 |url-status=dead }}</ref> in [[Polokwane]].

== Investigation of the origin ==
Prior to 2017, an average of 60 to 80 listeriosis cases were confirmed in South Africa per year.<ref name="2018_govt_report"/> The outbreak was first identified by doctors at [[Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital|Chris Hani]] and [[Steve Biko Academic Hospital|Steve Biko]] academic hospitals in July 2017, who notified the [[National Institute for Communicable Diseases]] (NICD) about an unusually high number of neonatal infections.<ref name="media-statement">{{cite press release|title=Media statement by the Minister of Health Dr Aaron Motsoaledi on the outbreak of a food borne disease in South Africa|date=5 December 2017|publisher=[[Department of Health (South Africa)|Department of Health]]|url=http://www.health.gov.za/index.php/component/phocadownload/category/439-listeriosis-minster-of-health-media-statement?download=2639:media-statement-by-the-minister-of-health-dr-aaron-motsoaledi-on-the-outbreak-of-a-food-borne-disease-in-south-africa|format=PDF}}</ref><ref name="Times-2017-12-05">{{cite news|url=https://www.timeslive.co.za/news/south-africa/2017-12-05-listeriosis-10-things-we-know-so-far/|title=Listeriosis: 10 things we know so far|last=Shange|first=Naledi|date=5 December 2017|work=[[Times Live]]|access-date=6 March 2018}}</ref>

Interviews conducted by the authorities with people who contracted listeriosis indicated that processed cold meats, most notably [[polony]], was the likely cause of the outbreak.  The source of the outbreak at the Enterprise Foods facility was only discovered after nine five-year-old children from Soweto were brought to Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital in mid-January 2018. Samples taken from Enterprise and [[Rainbow Chicken]] polony products at the [[Day care|crèche]] the children attended tested positive for the strain of listeriosis causing the outbreak and led investigators to the infected production facilities.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=https://www.businessinsider.co.za/Business/how-listeriosis-was-traced-to-tiger-brands-2018-3|title=How the deadly strain of listeriosis was traced to Tiger Brands' Enterprise polony factory|last=de Wet|first=Phillip|date=4 March 2018|website=www.businessinsider.co.za|access-date=2018-03-07|archive-date=2018-03-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180307151156/https://www.businessinsider.co.za/Business/how-listeriosis-was-traced-to-tiger-brands-2018-3|url-status=dead}}</ref>

On March 4, 2018, Health Minister [[Aaron Motsoaledi]] announced that the disease was traced to the Enterprise processed meats factory in Polokwane. Environmental samples from the factory were found to contain the bacterium ''[[Listeria monocytogenes]]'' strain ST 6, the strain responsible for the outbreak.<ref name="times-live-enterprise-identified" /> Additionally, further samples from another Enterprise factory in [[Germiston]] and from a Rainbow Chicken factory in the [[Free State (province)|Free State]] tested positive for Listeria, although which strain these samples tested positive for is not yet known.<ref>{{cite news|last=Petersen|first=Tammy|date=4 March 2018|title=Listeriosis outbreak traced to Enterprise facility in Polokwane|url=https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/breaking-listeriosis-outbreak-traced-to-enterprise-facility-in-polokwane-20180304|work=News24|access-date=6 March 2018}}</ref>

Laboratory-confirmed listeriosis cases started to rise in mid-2017 and peaked in December 2017, with 32 cases in a week.<ref name="2018_govt_report"/> [[Gauteng]] was the province with the most cases, 58%, followed by [[Western Cape]] with about 13%.<ref name="2018_govt_report"/> A report from the [[South African National Department of Health|National Department of Health]] in July 2018 stated there had been 1,060 laboratory-confirmed cases of listeriosis, and 216 deaths.<ref name="2018_govt_report"/>
