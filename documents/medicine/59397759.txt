Reported on November 9, 2018, two anonymous employees spoke to [[NJ Advance Media]] and claimed that "senior administrators delayed sending kids to the hospital" to keep the pediatric unit as full as possible, maximizing funds amounting to $519.46 from Medicaid per patient per day.

===Nov-Dec 2018: Wanaque aftermath===

On November 14, the center was ordered by the state to isolate sick patients<ref name="Problem After 4th"/> by November 21<ref name="Separates Patients"/> and curtail all new admissions.<ref name="Problem After 4th"/> By November 16, there were 43 children on the first-floor ventilator unit where the virus was spreading. 19 children were in a second-floor unaffected pediatric unit, with 125 adult patients in the facility.<ref name="Presently Ongoing Issues"/> On November 19, 2018, it was reported that The Wanaque Center had separated its medically fragile patients from those with adenovirus symptoms. The dropping number of patients had allowed enough space to separate beds, whereas previously patients were being cared for in close proximity.<ref name="Separates Patients">{{cite web|title=Wanaque Center separates patients with adenovirus |url=https://www.njtvonline.org/news/uncategorized/wanaque-center-separates-patients-with-adenovirus/ |date=November 19, 2018 |publisher=NJTV News }}</ref>

From October to November 2018, the virus infected 35 people at the Wanaque Center, including 23 children.<ref name="PhillyVoice">{{cite web|url=https://www.phillyvoice.com/adenovirus-virus-outbreak-death-maryland-new-jersey/|title=A Maryland college student died from the same adenovirus causing death toll in New Jersey|website=PhillyVoice|first=Bailey|last=King|date=November 21, 2018}}</ref>  Ultimately, 36 residents and one staff member were diagnosed with the adenovirus.<ref name="Requiring Outbreak"/> The ill ranged in age from toddlers to teens,<ref name="Requiring Outbreak"/> and eleven children died.<ref name="NJ"/><ref name="Problem After 4th"/> It was "one of the nation's deadliest long-term-care outbreaks"<ref name="Problem After 4th"/> and "one of the nation's worst recorded outbreaks of the [adeno]virus."<ref name="Familes At Hearing"/>

Over three visits in early November, state inspectors gave the Wanaque Center the worst rating possible, "immediate jeopardy."<ref name="Presently Ongoing Issues"/> Federal inspectors also visited the center, from November 13 through 17, giving the center six "immediate jeopardy violations" for systemic deficiencies in care.<ref name="Problem After 4th"/> Inspectors initially blamed poor hygiene for the outbreak.<ref name="Problem After 4th"/> However, later, federal inspectors also implicated poor planning by management.<ref name="Problem After 4th"/> A November 17<ref name="Problem After 4th"/> report by the New York office of the [[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services]] (CMS)<ref name="Time Writing About Outbreak">{{cite web|title=Federal Investigators Find Critical Failings at Health Center Where 11 Children Died in Virus Outbreak |url=http://time.com/5540986/wanaque-adenovirus-federal-report/ |date=March 4, 2019 |work=TIME |publisher= |access-date=August 22, 2019}}</ref> blamed the outbreak on the center's response, particularly management for lack of planning and slow responses, leading to delays "in identifying, reporting and controlling the outbreak."<ref name="Problem After 4th"/> The pediatric medical director, for example, was not informed what exactly his job was,<ref name="Time Writing About Outbreak"/><ref name="Problem After 4th"/> and was not informed of the number of infected patients until after the fourth death.<ref name="Problem After 4th"/> Wanaque Center strongly contested the findings, calling the report flawed<ref name="Time Writing About Outbreak"/> and appealing the report to dispute "unfounded allegations."<ref name="Problem After 4th"/> Several lawsuits concerning the outbreak were filed against the center in late 2018.<ref name="Problem After 4th"/><ref name="Kids like William">{{cite web|title=Lawsuit |url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/09/health/adenovirus-lawsuit-new-jersey/index.html |date= November 9, 2018|publisher=CNN |access-date=August 22, 2019}}</ref>

===Nov-Dec 2018: University of Maryland outbreak===
At the height of the outbreak in New Jersey, an outbreak of the same strain of the virus occurred among students at the [[University of Maryland, College Park]]. The college learned about the first case of adenovirus on November 1,<ref name="CNN"/> and by mid-December, 35 cases involving the same strain of the virus had been reported at the university. Among those cases, 18-year old freshman Olivia Paregol, who was "immunosuppressed because of medication for [[Crohn's disease]]",<ref name="Fox Baltimore"/> died on November 18, 2018.<ref name="WP"/> In its coverage, the press noted that an [[adenovirus vaccine]] exists but not generally available to the public.<ref name="NBC"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/adenovirus-killed-college-student-there-s-vaccine-she-couldn-t-n951061|title=Adenovirus strain that killed a college student may be growing more common|work=NBC News|first=Maggie|last=Fox|date=December 24, 2018}}</ref> It has been proposed that the Maryland outbreak was connected to a [[Mold (fungus)|mold]] outbreak on the campus during the same period.<ref name="PhillyVoice"/>

In January 2019, the University of Maryland began a weeks-long effort to have a contracted cleaning company disinfect all surfaces in the dorms where the outbreak occurred.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://baltimore.cbslocal.com/2019/01/07/cleaning-underway-at-umd-to-get-rid-of-adenovirus/|title=Cleaning Underway At UMD To Get Rid Of Adenovirus|publisher=CBS Baltimore|date=January 7, 2019}}</ref> The death of Paregol prompted Maryland Governor [[Larry Hogan]] to address the matter as "very concerning".<ref name="WP"/>

===2018-2019: New Jersey responses===
On November 20, 2018, members of the [[New Jersey Legislature]] representing the affected district sent a letter to [[New Jersey Attorney General]] [[Gurbir Grewal]] requesting an investigation of claims that "the facility delayed sending children for treatment for non-medical reasons" relating to the collection of [[Medicaid]] payments.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/health/2018/11/20/adenovirus-outbreak-nj-legislators-want-care-delays-investigated/2071458002/|title=Wanaque virus outbreak: Legislators ask attorney general to investigate delays in care|website=North Jersey|first=Lindy|last=Washburn|publisher=North Jersey Record|date=November 20, 2018}}</ref>
