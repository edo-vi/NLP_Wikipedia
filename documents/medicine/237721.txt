==History==

Cochrane, previously known as the Cochrane Collaboration, was founded in 1993 under the leadership of [[Iain Chalmers]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ault|first=Alicia|date=2003-06-27|title=Clinical research.

In 1998, the Cochrane Economics Methods Group (CEMG) was established to facilitate the basing of decisions on [[health economics]], [[evidence-based medicine]], and [[systematic review]]s.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://file.zums.ac.ir/ebook/085-Evidence-Based%20Health%20Economics%20(Evidence-Based%20Medicine)-Miranda%20Mugford%20Luke%20Vale%20Cam%20Donal.pdf |title=Evidence-based Health Economics |access-date=2 August 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130820193234/http://file.zums.ac.ir/ebook/085-Evidence-Based%20Health%20Economics%20(Evidence-Based%20Medicine)-Miranda%20Mugford%20Luke%20Vale%20Cam%20Donal.pdf |archive-date=20 August 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Cochrane's suggestion that methods used to prepare and maintain reviews of controlled trials in pregnancy and childbirth be applied more widely was taken up by the Research and Development Programme, initiated to support the [[National Health Service]]. Through the NHS research and development programme, led by [[Michael Peckham]],<ref>{{cite journal |author= Peckham M |title= Research and development for the National Health Service |journal= Lancet |volume= 338 |issue= 8763 |pages= 367–71 |date= August 1991 |pmid= 1677710 |doi= 10.1016/0140-6736(91)90494-A|s2cid= 38306406 }}</ref>{{When|date=August 2018}} funds were provided to establish a "Cochrane Centre", to collaborate with others, in the UK and elsewhere, to facilitate systematic reviews of randomised controlled trials across all areas of healthcare.<ref name="Dickersin">{{cite journal |vauthors= Dickersin K, Manheimer E |title= The Cochrane Collaboration: evaluation of health care and services using systematic reviews of the results of randomized controlled trials |journal= Clinical Obstetrics & Gynecology |volume= 41 |issue= 2 |pages= 315–331 |date= 1998 |pmid= 9646964 |doi= 10.1097/00003081-199806000-00012}}</ref>{{When|date=August 2018}}

In 2004, the [[Campbell Collaboration]] joined with the CEMG to form the Campbell & Cochrane Economics Methods Group (CCEMG).<ref>{{cite journal|pmc= 1660547|year= 2006|last1= Shemilt|first1= I|title= Economics methods in Cochrane systematic reviews of health promotion and public health related interventions|journal= BMC Medical Research Methodology|volume= 6|pages= 55|last2= Mugford|first2= M|last3= Drummond|first3= M|last4= Eisenstein|first4= E|last5= Mallender|first5= J|last6= McDaid|first6= D|last7= Vale|first7= L|last8= Walker|first8= D|author9= The Campbell & Cochrane Economics Methods Group (CCEMG)|pmid= 17107612|doi= 10.1186/1471-2288-6-55}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://methods.cochrane.org/economics/welcome |title=Welcome}}</ref>

In 2013 the organization published an editorial describing its efforts to train people in developing nations to perform Cochrane reviews.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors= Young T, Garner P, Kredo T, Mbuagbaw L, Tharyan P, Volmink J |year= 2013 |title= Cochrane and capacity building in low- and middle-income countries: where are we at?

During its 2018 annual meeting, the Cochrane board expelled [[Peter C. Gøtzsche]], board member and director of Cochrane's Nordic center, from the organization, telling [[Nature (journal)|''Nature'']] that it had received "numerous complaints" about Gøtzsche after he co-authored an article in ''BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine'' alleging bias in Cochrane's May 2018<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/bmjebm-2018-111012 |pmid=30054374 |title=The Cochrane HPV vaccine review was incomplete and ignored important evidence of bias |journal=BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine |volume=23 |issue=5 |pages=165–168 |year=2018 |last1=Jørgensen |first1=Lars |last2=Gøtzsche |first2=Peter C. |last3=Jefferson |first3=Tom|doi-access=free }}</ref> review of [[HPV vaccine]]s.

Gøtzsche remains an outspoken critic of Cochrane's relationship with the pharmaceutical industry. The Cochrane board stated that Gøtzsche was expelled for his behavior, which had been reviewed by an independent counsel hired by Cochrane.<ref name=NN2018-09/>

==Reception==
A 2004 editorial in the ''[[Canadian Medical Association Journal]]'' noted that Cochrane reviews appear to be more up to date and of better quality than other reviews, describing them as "the best single resource for methodologic research and for developing the science of meta-[[epidemiology]]" and crediting them with leading to methodological improvements in the medical literature.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1503/cmaj.1041255 |pmid=15451837 |pmc=517860 |title=So what has the Cochrane Collaboration ever done for us?

=== Funding partners ===
Cochrane receives funding from governments, [[Supranational organisation|supranational organizations]], [[non-governmental organization]]s, academic institutions, hospitals, and foundations, while avoiding funding from corporate interests.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Our funders and partners |url=https://www.cochrane.org/about-us/our-funders-and-partners |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220611182930/https://www.cochrane.org/about-us/our-funders-and-partners |archive-date=2022-06-11 |access-date=2022-06-11 |website=Cochrane |language=en}}</ref> Primary government donors include the United Kingdom's [[National Institute for Health and Care Research]] (NIHR), the [[Danish Health Authority]], the [[Federal Ministry of Health (Germany)]], and the [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH).

Academic funders include [[McMaster University]], [[Amsterdam University Medical Centers]], [[Kazan Federal University]], and [[University of Copenhagen]], among others. Funding from foundations includes the [[National Research Foundation (South Africa)]] and the Gerber Foundation.

==Public involvement==
Cochrane involves the public via [[biocuration#Community curation|community curation]], to produce systematic reviews and other outputs. Tasks can be organised as 'entry level' or higher. Tasks include:
* Joining a collaborative volunteer effort to help categorise and summarise healthcare evidence<ref>{{cite web|url=http://crowd.cochrane.org/index.html|title=Cochrane crowd|website=crowd.cochrane.org|access-date=2019-02-14}}</ref>
* Data extraction and risk of bias assessment
* translation of reviews into other languages

A recent systematic review of how people were involved in systematic reviews aimed to document the evidence-base relating to stakeholder involvement in systematic reviews and to use this evidence to describe how stakeholders have been involved in systematic reviews.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Pollock A, Campbell P, Struthers C, Synnot A, Nunn J, Hill S, Goodare H, Morris J, Watts C, Morley R|date=November 2018|title=Stakeholder involvement in systematic reviews: a scoping review|journal=Systematic Reviews|volume=7|issue=1|pages=208|doi=10.1186/s13643-018-0852-0|pmc=6260873|pmid=30474560}}</ref> Thirty per cent involved patients and/or carers.
