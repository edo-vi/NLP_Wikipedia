'''Iridovirus dwarf gourami disease''' is a widespread consequence caused by the poor genetics of the [[dwarf gourami]], a popular fish in the aquarium trade. It is the result of severe inbreeding.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://tankaddict.com/dwarf-gourami/ | title=DG inbreeding|accessdate=14 January 2022|work=tankaddict}}</ref> Despite being unable to develop the disease, other gourami become prone to infection if a dwarf gourami in the tank gets the ''[[Iridovirus]]''. Once symptoms develop, the gourami's mortality rate reaches 100% and there is no cure nor treatment.
