'''Feline spongiform encephalopathy''' ('''FSE''') is a disease that affects the brains of [[felidae|feline]]s. It is caused by [[protein]]s called [[prion]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Iulini |first1=B. |last2=Cantile |first2=C. |last3=Mandara |first3=M. T. |last4=Maurella |first4=C. |last5=Loria |first5=G.

==Symptoms and signs==
Clinical signs of FSE typically develop gradually in housecats. Initial signs of the condition include behavioral changes such as aggression, timidity, and hiding. Other commonly observed motor signs include gait abnormalities and ataxia, which typically affect the hind legs first. Affected cats may also display poor judgement of distance, and some cats may develop a rapid, crouching, hypermetric gait. Another common symptom is [[hyperesthesia]]. Some affected cats may exhibit an abnormal head tilt, tremors, a vacant stare, excessive salivation, decreased grooming behaviors, [[polyphagia]], [[polydipsia]], and dilated pupils. Once signs of FSE appear, the disease progresses and results in death within a few weeks to 3 months.<ref>{{cite web |title=Feline Spongiform Encephalopathy |url=https://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/feline_spongiform_encephalopathy.pdf |website=Center for Food Security and Public Health |access-date=27 February 2023}}</ref>

[[Ataxia]] was observed to last for about 8 weeks in the affected animals. The ultimate result is death of the infected animals.<ref name="provet" />

==Diagnosis==
This disease can only be confirmed at the [[post-mortem]], which includes identification of bilaterally symmetrical [[vacuole|vacuolation]] of the [[neuropil]] and vacuolation in [[neuron]]es. [[Lesion]]s are likely to be found in [[basal ganglia]], [[cerebral cortex]] and [[thalamus]] of the [[brain]].{{cn|date=December 2022}}

==Treatment==
This is a [[Terminal illness|terminal]] condition and there is currently no specific treatment for the disease.<ref name="provet"/>

==Epidemiology==
This disease was first reported in domestic cats within the United Kingdom in 1990.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://archive.defra.gov.uk/foodfarm/farmanimal/diseases/atoz/bse/othertses/index.htm#fse | title=ARCHIVE: BSE: Other TSEs | access-date=2012-09-02 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120817003032/http://archive.defra.gov.uk/foodfarm/farmanimal/diseases/atoz/bse/othertses/index.htm#fse | archive-date=2012-08-17 | url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name="german" /> Since 1990, cases have been reported in other countries and other feline species in captivity, although most affected felines originated in the UK.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Imran |first1=Muhammad |last2=Mahmood |first2=Saqib |title=An overview of animal prion diseases |journal=Virology Journal |date=1 November 2011 |volume=8 |issue=1 |page=493 |doi=10.1186/1743-422X-8-493 |pmid=22044871 |pmc=3228711}}</ref>
