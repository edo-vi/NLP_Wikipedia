'''Xanthochromism''' (also called '''xanthochroism''' or '''xanthism'''), from the Greek ''xanthos'' (ξανθός) "yellow" and ''chroma'' (χρώμα) "color", is an unusually yellow pigmentation in an animal. It is often associated with the lack of usual red pigmentation and its replacement with yellow.  The cause is usually genetic but may also be related to the animal's diet.  A [[Cornell University]] survey of unusual-looking birds visiting [[Bird feeding|feeder]]s reported that 4% of such birds were described as xanthochromistic (compared with 76% [[Albinism|albinistic]]).  The opposite of xanthochromism, a deficiency in or complete absence of yellow pigment, is known as ''axanthism''.

Birds exhibiting genetic xanthochromism, especially deliberately bred mutations of several species of [[parrot]] in [[aviculture]], are termed "lutinos".  Wild birds in which xanthochromism has been recorded include [[Yellow wagtail (disambiguation)|yellow wagtail]], [[wood warbler]], [[Cape May warbler]], [[rose-breasted grosbeak]], [[evening grosbeak]], [[red-bellied woodpecker]], [[scarlet tanager]], [[northern cardinal]], [[great spotted woodpecker]], [[common tailorbird]], [[crimson-breasted shrike]], [[kākāriki]] and [[kea]].
