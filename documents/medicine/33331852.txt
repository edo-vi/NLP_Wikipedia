'''''Mycoplasma meleagridis''''' is a small [[bacteria]] responsible for [[air sacculitis]] and disorders of the musculoskeletal and reproductive systems in [[Turkey (bird)|turkeys]]. These symptoms are also known as Mycoplasma air sacculitis, Mycoplasma infectious stunting, and [[Mycoplasmosis]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2020}}

The infection is more severe in [[Poult|young birds]] and occurs globally wherever turkeys are reared intensively. Transmission is mainly [[Vertical transmission|vertical]] via the egg but ticks such as the [[Ixodes]] species can also be [[Tick-borne disease|vectors]].

==Clinical signs and diagnosis==
The infection is often [[subclinical]] but may appear as mild stunting.

Air sacculitis appears as [[tachypnoea]], [[Rhinorrhea|nasal discharge]] and [[sneezing]].

Musculoskeletal problems can lead to lameness, swelling and crooked necks.

There may be a drop in egg production.

The bacteria can be [[Microbiological culture|cultured]] from tissue samples or swabs and identified with [[Polymerase chain reaction|PCR]] or [[immunofluorescence]].

[[ELISA]] and the Slide Agglutination Test are used for serological diagnosis.

==Treatment and control==
[[Antibiotics]] are effective at treating and preventing the infection, especially [[Tylosin]] but also [[Lincomycin]] and [[Spectinomycin]].

[[Vertical transmission]] is difficult to prevent, but males can be tested before breeding and eggs can be dipped in a Tylosin bath.
