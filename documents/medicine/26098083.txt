'''Velada''' is the name of the healing vigils carried out by [[Mazatec people|Mazatec]] ''[[curandero]]s'' (such as [[María Sabina]]). The rituals involved the use of [[psilocybin]] (magic mushrooms) or ''[[Salvia divinorum]]''<ref>Danilo Parra, [https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/yvebgv/salvia-velada-mazatec-shaman-ceremony-portfolio-v23n8 Salvia Velada: Experiencing a Traditional Mazatec Shaman Ceremony], ''Vice.com'', 8 November 2016</ref> to commune with God and experience enlightenment.

==History==
In May 1957, the banker and ethnomycologist [[R. Gordon Wasson]] published an article in the ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'', ''[[Seeking the Magic Mushroom]]'', describing his first experience consuming the mushroom and following the Velada of a shaman back in 1955. He claimed to be among the two first modern Western men to follow a traditional Velada ritual on psilocybin.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=Jj8EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA100 LIFE Magazine article (May 13, 1957)]</ref> His tale inspired a generation of «mycotourists» seeking to experience the authentic Mazatec Veladas.<ref>Paja Faudree, [https://books.google.com/books?id=kYQWa9pzobEC Singing for the Dead: The Politics of Indigenous Revival in Mexico], ''Duke University Press'', 29 May 2013</ref><ref name="psychedelictimes entheogens">Wesley Thoricatha, [https://psychedelictimes.com/psilocybin-mushrooms/history-of-psychedelics-how-the-mazatec-tribe-brought-entheogens-to-the-world/ History of Psychedelics: How the Mazatec Tribe Brought Entheogens to the World], ''Psychedelictims.com'', 28 October 2015</ref>

Wasson's [[curandero]] was [[Maria Sabina]]. She was seen as a traitor by her community and rejected. She had received rock stars such as [[John Lennon]], [[Mick Jagger]], and [[Bob Dylan]] to follow the Mazatec Velada, which had led to an international exposition of the Mazatec's entheogenic secrets.<ref name="psychedelictimes entheogens"/>
