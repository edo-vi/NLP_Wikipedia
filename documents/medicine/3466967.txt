The  word '''Gamat''', the [[Malay language|Malay]] word for [[Holothuroidea|sea cucumber]], refers to medicinal remedies derived from several species of the [[Holothuroidea]] family.

==Uses==
The golden sea cucumber (''[[Stichopus horrens]]'') is commonly used. Tripang Emas is usually the dried, powdered bodies of sea cucumbers made into a lotion or other topical salve.

It is sometimes mixed into clay and applied to the face as a mask treatment, or put in tea and consumed for stomach complaints. Users believe that a solution of sea cucumbers can heal cuts, skin eruptions, and ulcers, and claim that it has a beneficial effect on the [[immune system]].

==Scarcity==
Sea cucumbers in the waters of [[Malaysia]] have been [[over-harvested]] to supply consumers of the folk remedy, and as a result the animal and its products are becoming scarce. Efforts to restock the fishery have not generally been successful. Recently, a sea cucumber [[aquaculture]] operation was opened on the shores of several Malaysian islands to increase the gamat supply.
