A '''booster dose''' is an extra administration of a [[vaccine]] after an earlier ([[Priming (immunology)|primer]]) dose. After initial [[immunization]], a booster provides a re-exposure to the immunizing [[antigen]]. It is intended to increase immunity against that antigen back to protective levels after memory against that antigen has declined through time. For example, [[tetanus]] shot boosters are often recommended every 10 years, by which point memory cells specific against tetanus lose their function or undergo [[apoptosis]].<ref>{{Citation |publisher=Mayo Clinic |date=2006-09-21 |accessdate=2008-07-17 |title=Tetanus: Prevention |url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/tetanus/DS00227/DSECTION=prevention |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080624072321/http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/tetanus/DS00227/DSECTION%3Dprevention |archivedate=2008-06-24 }}</ref>

The need for a booster dose following a primary vaccination is evaluated in several ways. One way is to measure the level of [[Antibody|antibodies]] specific against a disease a few years after the primary dose is given. Anamnestic response, the rapid production of antibodies after a stimulus of an antigen, is a typical way to measure the need for a booster dose of a certain vaccine. If the anamnestic response is high after receiving a primary vaccine many years ago, there is most likely little to no need for a booster dose.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = A review of the long-term protection after hepatitis A and B vaccination|journal = Travel Medicine and Infectious Disease|date = 2007-03-01|pages = 79–84|volume = 5|series = 1st International Conference of Travel Medicine and Infectious Disease1st International Conference of Travel Medicine and Infectious Disease|issue = 2|doi = 10.1016/j.tmaid.2006.04.004|first1 = Pierre|last1 = Van Damme|first2 = Koen|last2 = Van Herck|pmid=17298912}}</ref> People can also measure the active [[B cell|B]] and [[T cell]] activity against that antigen after a certain amount of time that the primary vaccine was administered or determine the prevalence of the disease in vaccinated populations.<ref name=":0"/>

If a patient receives a booster dose but already has a high level of antibody, then a reaction called an [[Arthus reaction]] could develop, a localized form of Type III [[hypersensitivity]] induced by high levels of [[Immunoglobulin G|IgG]] antibodies causing [[inflammation]].<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Immunologic Reactions|url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK236294/|date = 1994-01-01|language = en|first1 = Institute of Medicine (US) Vaccine Safety|last1 = Committee|first2 = Kathleen R.|last2 = Stratton|first3 = Cynthia J.|last3 = Howe|first4 = Jr|last4 = Richard B. Johnston|publisher = National Academies Press (US)}}</ref> The inflammation is often self-resolved over the course of a few days but could be avoided altogether by increasing the length of time between the primary vaccine and the booster dose.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Remington: the science and practice of pharmacy|author= University of the Sciences in Philadelphia|author2= David B.

It is not yet fully clear why some vaccines such as hepatitis A and B  are effective for life, and some such as tetanus need boosters.  The prevailing theory is that if the immune system responds to a primary vaccine rapidly, the body does not have time to sufficiently develop immunological memory against the disease, and memory cells will not persist in high numbers for the lifetime of the human.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Top 20 Questions about Vaccination — History of Vaccines|url = http://www.historyofvaccines.org/content/articles/top-20-questions-about-vaccination#5|website = www.historyofvaccines.org|access-date = 2016-01-30}}</ref> After a primary response of the immune system against a vaccination, memory T helper cells and B cells persist at a fairly constant level in [[germinal center]]s, undergoing cell division at a slow to nonexistent rate. While these cells are long-lived,  they do not typically undergo mitosis, and eventually, the rate of loss of these cells will be greater than the rate of gain. In these cases, a booster dose is required to "boost" the [[memory B cell|memory B]] and [[Memory T cell|T cell]] count back up again.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Immunological memory|url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK27158/|date = 2001-01-01|language = en|first1 = Jr|last1 = Charles A Janeway|first2 = Paul|last2 = Travers|first3 = Mark|last3 = Walport|first4 = Mark J.|last4 = Shlomchik}}</ref>

== Polio booster doses ==
In the case of the [[polio vaccine]], the [[memory B cell|memory B]] and [[Memory T cell|T cell]]s produced in response to the vaccine persist only six months after consumption of the oral polio vaccine (OPV). Booster doses of the OPV were found ineffective, as they, too, resulted in decreased [[immune response]] every six months after consumption. However, when the inactive polio vaccine (IPV) was used as a booster dose, it was found to increase the test subjects' antibody count by 39–75%.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Efficacy of inactivated poliovirus vaccine in India|url = https://www.science.org/journal/science|journal = Science|date = 2014-08-22|issn = 0036-8075|pmid = 25146288|pages = 922–925|volume = 345|issue = 6199|doi = 10.1126/science.1255006|language = en|first1 = Hamid|last1 = Jafari|first2 = Jagadish M.|last2 = Deshpande|first3 = Roland W.|last3 = Sutter|first4 = Sunil|last4 = Bahl|first5 = Harish|last5 = Verma|first6 = Mohammad|last6 = Ahmad|first7 = Abhishek|last7 = Kunwar|first8 = Rakesh|last8 = Vishwakarma|first9 = Ashutosh|last9 = Agarwal|bibcode = 2014Sci...345..922J|doi-access = free}}</ref> Often in developing countries, OPV is used over IPV, because IPV is expensive and hard to transport. Also, IPVs in tropical countries are hard to store due to the climate. However, in places where polio is still present, following up an OPV primary dose with an IPV booster may help eradicate the disease.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = A one-two punch against polio|journal = Science|date = 2014-08-22|issn = 0036-8075|pmid = 25146262|pages = 861–862|volume = 345|issue = 6199|doi = 10.1126/science.345.6199.861|language = en|first = Leslie|last = Roberts|bibcode = 2014Sci...345..861R}}</ref>

In the United States, only the IPV is used. In rare cases (about 1 in 2.7 million), the OPV has reverted to a strengthened form of the illness, and caused paralysis in the recipients of the vaccine. For this reason, the US only administers IPV, which is given in four increments (3 within their first year and a half after birth, then one booster dose between the ages 4–6).<ref>{{Cite web|title = Vaccines: VPD-VAC/Polio/main page|url = https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd-vac/polio/default.htm|website = www.cdc.gov|access-date = 2016-02-09}}</ref>

== Hepatitis B booster doses ==

The need for a booster dose for [[hepatitis B]] has long been debated. Studies in the early 2000s that measured memory cell count of vaccinated individuals showed that fully vaccinated adults (those that received all three rounds of vaccination at the suggested time sequence during infancy) do not require a booster dose later in life. Both the United States [[Centers for Disease Control]] (CDC) and the Canadian [[National Advisory Committee on Immunization]] (NACI) supported these recommendations by publicly advising against the need for a hepatitis B booster dose.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|title = Hepatitis B and the Need for a Booster Dose|journal = Clinical Infectious Diseases|date = 2011-07-01|issn = 1058-4838|pmid = 21653306|pages = 68–75|volume = 53|issue = 1|doi = 10.1093/cid/cir270|language = en|first1 = Elke|last1 = Leuridan|first2 = Pierre Van|last2 = Damme|doi-access = free}}</ref>  However, [[immunosuppression|immuno-repressed]] individuals are advised to seek further screening to evaluate their immune response to hepatitis B, and potentially receive a booster dose if their B and T cell count against hepatitis B decrease below a certain level.{{citation needed|date=December 2020}}

== Tetanus booster dose ==
The [[tetanus]] disease requires a booster dose every 10 years, or in some circumstances immediately following infection of tetanus. Td is the name of the booster for adults, and differs from the primary dose in that it does not include immunization against [[pertussis]] (whooping cough).<ref>{{Cite web|title = Vaccines: VPD-VAC/Tetanus/main page|url = https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd-vac/tetanus/|website = www.cdc.gov|access-date = 2016-02-09}}</ref> While the US recommends a booster for tetanus every 10 years, other countries, such as the UK, suggest just two booster shots within the first 20 years of life, but no booster after a third decade.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Tetanus: a review of the literature|journal = British Journal of Anaesthesia|date = 2001-09-01|issn = 0007-0912|pmid = 11517134|pages = 477–487|volume = 87|issue = 3|doi = 10.1093/bja/87.3.477|language = en|first1 = T.

== Whooping cough booster dose ==
Whooping cough, also called pertussis, is a contagious disease that affects the [[respiratory tract]]. The infection is caused by a bacterium that sticks to the cilia of the upper respiratory tract and can be very contagious. Pertussis can be especially dangerous for babies, whose immune systems are not yet fully developed, and can develop into [[pneumonia]] or result in the baby having trouble breathing.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Pertussis {{!}} Whooping Cough {{!}} Complications {{!}} CDC|url = https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/about/complications.html|website = www.cdc.gov|access-date = 2016-02-16}}</ref> [[DPT vaccine|DTaP]] is the primary vaccine given against pertussis, and children typically receive five doses before the age of seven. Tdap is the booster for pertussis, and is advised in the US to be administered every ten years, and during every pregnancy for mothers. Tdap can also be used as a booster against tetanus.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Vaccines: VPD-VAC/Pertussis/main page|url = https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd-vac/pertussis/default.htm?s_cid=cs_074|website = www.cdc.gov|access-date = 2016-02-16}}</ref>

Upon its invention in the 1950s, the pertussis vaccine was whole-cell (contained the entire inactivated bacterium), and could cause fever and local reactions in people who received the vaccine. In the 1990s, people in the US started using acellular vaccines (contained small portions of the bacterium), that had lower side effects but were also less effective at triggering an immunological memory response, due to the antigen presented to the immune system being less complete.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Whooping Cough in 2014 and Beyond: An Update and Review|journal = Chest|date = 2014-07-01|pages = 205–214|volume = 146|issue = 1|doi = 10.1378/chest.13-2942|first1 = Joshua D.|last1 = Hartzell|first2 = Jason M.|last2 = Blaylock|pmid=25010963|doi-access = free}}</ref> This less effective, but safer vaccine, led to the development of the booster Tdap.{{cn|date=March 2022}}

== COVID-19 booster dose ==
{{Asof|2021|09}}, protection against severe disease remained high at 6 months after vaccination despite lower efficacy in protection from [[COVID-19]] infection. An international panel of scientists affiliated with the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]], [[World Health Organization|WHO]], and several universities and healthcare institutions, concluded that there was insufficient data to determine the long-term protective benefits of a booster dose (only short-term protective effects were observed), and recommended instead that existing vaccine stock would save most lives if made available to people who had not received any vaccine.<ref name="krause">{{cite journal | last1=Krause | first1=Philip R | last2=Fleming | first2=Thomas R | last3=Peto | first3=Richard | last4=Longini | first4=Ira M | last5=Figueroa | first5=J Peter | last6=Sterne | first6=Jonathan A C | last7=Cravioto | first7=Alejandro | last8=Rees | first8=Helen | last9=Higgins | first9=Julian P T | last10=Boutron | first10=Isabelle | last11=Pan | first11=Hongchao | last12=Gruber | first12=Marion F | last13=Arora | first13=Narendra | last14=Kazi | first14=Fatema | last15=Gaspar | first15=Rogerio | last16=Swaminathan | first16=Soumya | last17=Ryan | first17=Michael J | last18=Henao-Restrepo | first18=Ana-Maria | title=Considerations in boosting COVID-19 vaccine immune responses | journal=The Lancet| volume=398 | issue=10308 | year=2021 | issn=0140-6736 | doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(21)02046-8 | pages=1377–1380|pmid=34534516|pmc=8437678 }}</ref>

In the United States, the CDC rolled out booster shots to immunocompromised individuals during the summer of 2021 and originally planned to allow adults to receive a third dose of the [[COVID-19 vaccine]] starting in September 2021, with individuals becoming eligible starting 8 months after their second dose (for those who received a two-dose vaccine).<ref>{{cite web |title=COVID-19 Vaccine Booster Shot |url=https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/booster-shot.html |website=www.cdc.gov |access-date=August 22, 2021}}</ref> After further data about long-term vaccine efficacy and the delta variant came to light, the CDC ultimately made recipients eligible for boosters 6 months after the second shot, in late October.<ref>{{cite web |title=CDC Expands Eligibility for COVID-19 Booster Shots|url=https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/p1021-covid-booster.html|website=www.cdc.gov |date=October 21, 2021}}</ref> Subsequently, vaccinations in the country surged.<ref>{{cite web |title=Trends in Number of COVID-19 Vaccinations in the US |url=https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccination-trends |website=www.cdc.gov |date=28 March 2020 |access-date=25 November 2021}}</ref>

In September 2021, the UK's [[Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation]] recommended a booster shot for the over-50s and at-risk groups, preferably the [[Pfizer–BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine|Pfizer–BioNTech vaccine]], meaning about 30 million adults should receive a third dose.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Covid boosters can be offered to all UK over-50s, watchdog confirms|work=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/sep/14/covid-boosters-offered-to-all-uk-over-50s-jcvi-watchdog-confirms|date=14 September 2021|access-date=14 September 2021}}</ref> The UK's booster rollout was extended to over-40s in November 2021.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Gallagher|first=James|date=November 15, 2021|title=Covid booster doses will be offered to over-40s|url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-59289008.amp|work=BBC News|access-date=November 19, 2021}}</ref>

Russia's Sputnik V COVID-19 vaccine, using similar technology to AstraZeneca's COVID-19 vaccine, in November 2021 introduced a COVID-19 booster called Sputnik Light, which according to a study by the [[Gamaleya Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology]] has an effectiveness of 70% against the delta variant.<ref>[https://www.india.com/news/world/sputnik-v-sputnik-light-booster-omicron-study-covid-vaccine-coronavirus-5151055/ Sputnik V, Sputnik Light Booster Effective Against Omicron: Study], [[India.com]] (22 December 2021)</ref> It can be combined with all other vaccines and may be more effective with mRNA vaccines than mRNA boosters.<ref>{{cite web | title=russia-to-recommend-using-sputnik-light-only-as-booster-shot-against-covid19 |date=30 October 2021 |agency=Reuters |url=https://www.livemint.com/news/world/russia-to-recommend-using-sputnik-light-only-as-booster-shot-against-covid19-11635604903238.html|access-date=1 November 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | title=Mix-and-Match Covid Boosters: Why They Just Might Work |work=New York Times |date=19 October 2021 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/19/health/covid-vaccine-mix-match.html|access-date=1 November 2021|last1=Zimmer |first1=Carl }}</ref>

Booster shots can also be used after infections. In this regard, the UK's National Health Service recommends people to wait 28 days after testing positive for COVID-19 before getting their booster shots. Evidence shows that getting a vaccine after recovery from a COVID-19 infection provides added protection to the immune system.<ref>{{cite web|first1=Amir|last1=Khan|title=When to have the booster shot if you have recently had COVID|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2022/2/2/when-to-have-the-booster-jab-if-you-have-had-covid-19|website=Al Jazeera|date=2 February 2022}}</ref>
