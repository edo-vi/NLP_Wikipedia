The '''biological terrain assessment''' or '''BTA''' is a set of tests used to measure the [[pH]], [[resistivity]], and [[redox]] of a person's [[urine]], [[blood]], and [[saliva]].<ref name="Barrett1">{{cite web |last1=Barrett |first1=Stephen |title=Biological Terrain Assessment Is Nonsense |url=https://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/Tests/bioter.html |website=Quackwatch.org |access-date=19 June 2019 |date=9 April 2002}}</ref><ref name="Comprehensive Health Center 2018"/> The measurements were first used by L.C.

The usefulness of the test is debatable and according to physician [[Stephen Barrett]] BTA is outdated, apart from pH measurement, and is an inferior assessment technique that should not be favored over more modern techniques.<ref name="Barrett1"/>

== Usefulness ==

Proponents of the BTA claim that comparing the pH, resistivity, and [[redox]] of the blood, urine, and saliva provides a health practitioner an indication of the metabolic processes taking place inside the body.<ref name="Comprehensive Health Center 2018">{{cite web | title=Biological Terrain Assessment - The Non Invasive Test Your Doctor Isn't Giving You | website=Comprehensive Health Center | date=2018-06-25 | url=https://comp-health.com/bio-terrain-assessment/ | access-date=2019-06-20}}</ref> There is no scientific evidence that these measurements provide a medically relevant indication of metabolic processes. Multiple manufacturers of BTA equipment have been prevented from selling their equipment in the United States because they lack [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) approval. However, the FDA has not stated whether the BTA is medically useful or not.{{cn|date=April 2022}}

The Quantitative Fluid Analyzer (QFA) manufactured by Health Science Company does have FDA classification as a "laboratory instrument for medical purposes" "ion selective", Class 1 510(K) exempt.{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}} However it does not have CLIA (Clinical Laboratory improvement Amendment, 1988) waiver.{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}
