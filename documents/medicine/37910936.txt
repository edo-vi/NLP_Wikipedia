{{Short description|Saliva produced first thing in the morning}}
'''Fasting spittle'''&nbsp;– [[saliva]] produced first thing in the morning, before breakfast&nbsp;– has been used to treat a wide variety of diseases for many hundreds of years. Spittle cures are usually considered to be more effective if [[fasting]] spittle is used.{{sfnp|Roud|2006|loc=wart cures: fasting spittle|ps=none}}

An early recorded use of spittle as a cure comes from the [[Gospel of Mark|Gospel of St Mark]], believed to have been written in about 70&nbsp;AD:
{{bq|text=And they bring unto him [Jesus] one that was deaf, and had an impediment in his speech&nbsp;... And he took him aside from the multitude, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spit, and touched his tongue; and saith unto him, Ephphatha, that is, Be opened. {{bibleverse||Mark|7:32–5}}}}
Writing at about the same time as Mark, the Roman [[natural philosopher]] [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] commented in his ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'' that fasting spittle was efficacious in the treatment of [[ophthalmia]], and that the fasting spittle of a woman was particularly beneficial for treating bloodshot eyes.{{r|OpieTatem}}
