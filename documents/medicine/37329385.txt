'''Choosing Wisely''' is a United States-based [[health]] educational campaign, led by the ABIM Foundation ([[American Board of Internal Medicine]]), about [[unnecessary health care]].<ref name="GuestCassel">{{Cite journal | last1 = Cassel | first1 = Christine.

The campaign identifies over 500 tests and procedures and encourages doctors and patients to discuss, research, and possibly get second opinions, before proceeding with them.<ref name="zik"/> To conduct the campaign, the ABIM Foundation asks [[Specialty (medicine)|medical specialty]] societies to make five to ten recommendations for preventing overuse of a treatment in their field. The foundation then publicizes this information, and the medical specialty societies disseminate it to their members.

The campaign has garnered both praise and criticism, and some of its ideas have spread to other countries. It does not include evaluation of its effects on costs, on discussions or on medical outcomes.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Who We Are & History|url=https://www.abimfoundation.org/who-we-are|access-date=2020-07-07|website=ABIM Foundation|language=en-US}}</ref> Some doctors have said they lack time for the recommended discussions.<ref name="zik" />

Some examples of the information shared in ''Choosing Wisely'' include the following:
* Acknowledge that physicians are increasing their use of diagnostic procedures without a proportional increase in patient benefits ( improved outcomes). Consider the effects of overuse of diagnostic services.<ref>

==Challenges==
The ''Choosing Wisely'' campaign identifies the following difficulties in achieving its goals:
* In communicating with patients a major challenge in the campaign is the problem inherent in [[patient-centered care]] of giving patients some basis for understanding how to make decisions about their health care.<ref name="Volpp">{{Cite journal|author1-link=Kevin Volpp | last1 = Volpp | first1 = K. G. | last2 = Loewenstein | first2 = George | last3 = Asch | first3 = David A. | title = Choosing Wisely: Low-Value Services, Utilization, and Patient Cost Sharing| doi = 10.1001/jama.2012.13616 | journal = The Journal of the American Medical Association | volume = 308 | issue = 16 | pages = 1635–1636 | year = 2012 | pmid =  23093160| pmc = 3994996}}</ref> Many recommendations in the campaign require clinical education to understand fully.<ref name="Volpp"/> Also many patients tend to follow the recommendations of their physicians without question, even if they have questions.<ref name="Volpp"/>'''
* The United States medical system is based on a [[fee-for-service]] model, in which doctors are paid on the basis of work they do, so they are paid for procedures they do, though not tests or procedures which they refer to others.<ref name="Volpp"/> This system creates incentives for doctors to provide additional treatments, rather than exercising evidence-based restraint.<ref name="Volpp"/>
* Critics tend to view efforts to reduce medical services as "[[healthcare rationing in the United States]]".<ref name="Volpp"/> Since doctors do not want to be seen as withholding care, they are hesitant to change established behavior in any way that lessens the amount of treatment they order.<ref name="Volpp"/><ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Bloche | first1 = M.

==Reception==
The American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) initially formed three independent task forces to evaluate whether to participate; by 2012 all three task forces recommended against participation because the recommendations do not recognize that emergency physicians need extra tests, since they do not know the patients, do not recognize that emergency physicians need to eliminate every life-threatening possibility, will lead to refusals by insurers to cover items on the lists, let other medical societies tell emergency physicians what to do, and because the campaign doesn't address [[tort reform]] to address defensive testing, and the campaign publicizes the items as "unnecessary tests" even though describing them as tests to discuss carefully.<ref name="seaberg">{{Cite news |url=http://epmonthly.com/article/the-wiser-choice-should-acep-join-the-choosing-wisely-campaign-no/ |title=Pro/Con: Why ACEP Should Not Join the 'Choosing Wisely' Campaign - Emergency Physicians Monthly |last=Seaberg |first=David |date=2012-05-08 |work=Emergency Physicians Monthly |access-date=2018-11-23 |language=en-US}}</ref>

While expressing the need for evidence-based healthcare recommendations, in 2012 ''[[The Economist]]'' found the ''Choosing Wisely'' recommendations to be weak because they are not enforceable.<ref name="Evidenceshmevidence">{{cite web |url= http://www.economist.com/node/21556928 |title=Evaluating medical treatments: Evidence, shmevidence |work=economist.com |date=16 June 2012 |access-date=16 October 2012}}</ref> In an editorial published in the ''Southwest Journal of Pulmonary and Critical Care'', Richard Robbin and Allen Thomas expressed concern that the campaign could be used by payers to limit options for doctors and patients.

Also in 2012, Robert Goldberg, writing for ''[[The American Spectator]]'', criticized the program saying that it was "designed to sustain the rationale and ideology that shaped Obamacare" (the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]]), that the lists were "redundant and highly subjective", and that participants in the effort would greedily benefit at the expense of others if the campaign succeeded.<ref name="RobertGoldberg">{{cite web |url=https://spectator.org/35711_obamacares-medical-mercenaries/ |title=Obamacare's Medical Mercenaries |first=Robert M. |last=Goldberg |work=[[The American Spectator]] |date=13 April 2012 |access-date=16 October 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170709112636/https://spectator.org/35711_obamacares-medical-mercenaries/ |archive-date=9 July 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

In February 2013 the [[Robert Wood Johnson Foundation]] provided USD $2.5 million in funding for the campaign, saying that the foundation wanted to "help increase the tangible impact of the ''Choosing Wisely'' campaign".<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucejapsen/2013/02/21/doctors-call-out-90-more-unnecessary-medical-tests-procedures/ |title=Doctors Call Out 90 More Unnecessary Medical Tests, Procedures - Forbes |first=Bruce |last=Japsen |work=forbes.com |date=21 February 2013 |access-date=22 February 2013}}</ref>

A 2013 editorial in the journal of the Netherlands Society of Cardiology reviewed the recommendations and recommended that something similar be proposed by the society; the piece did criticize the overly didactic nature of the recommendations, comparing them to the [[Ten Commandments]], and expressed concern about whether they adequately addressed the difficulties of assessing risks for each patient.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Boer | first1 = M. -J. | last2 = Wall | first2 = E.

In 2015 the campaign was criticized by Bob Lanier, executive director of a medical specialty society and past president of the Texas Medical Association Foundation, who said that the recommendations were compiled by societies' executive committees without good evidence and without following standards of practice or research, will lead to refusals by insurers to cover items on the lists, are biased against diagnostic testing, are an effort by supporters of [[single-payer healthcare]] to reduce costs so that single-payer healthcare becomes affordable, will encourage biased studies by authors funded by insurers and health delivery systems, to cut their costs, and were influenced by grants available from the ABIM Foundation.<ref name="texas">{{Cite web |url=https://www.texmed.org/Template.aspx?id=33002 |title=Think Twice Before Choosing Wisely |date=March 2015 |website=www.texmed.org |language=en |access-date=2018-05-22}}</ref>

The ''Choosing Wisely'' campaign makes no provision to scientifically research its own efficacy, but academic centers are making plans to independently report on the impact of the campaign.<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323864304578315941739509284 |title=Group Urges Health-Test Curbs |first=Shirley S. |last=Wang |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |date=20 February 2013 |publisher=[[Dow Jones & Company|Dow Jones]] |location=[[New York, NY|New York]] |issn=0099-9660 |access-date=22 February 2013}}</ref> The services targeted by the Choosing Wisely lists have broad variance in how much impact they can have on patients' care and costs.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1056/NEJMp1314965| title = Choosing Wisely — the Politics and Economics of Labeling Low-Value Services| year = 2014| last1 = Morden | first1 = N.
