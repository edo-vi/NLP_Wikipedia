== Contemporary forms ==
In modern times charcoal biscuits are made in the form of crackers to accompany cheeses. The biscuits have a slight hint of charcoal taste that is described by some as pleasing.<ref>{{Cite news |first=Brad |last=Frenette |date=2008-04-16 |title=Impulse Buy: Miller's Damsel Charcoal Crackers |newspaper=The National Post |url=http://network.nationalpost.com/np/blogs/theappetizer/archive/2008/04/16/impulse-buy-miller-s-damsel-charcoal-crackers.aspx }}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web| first=James |last=Norton |title=Supertasters: Steppin' up your cheese game |publisher=CHOW |url=http://www.chow.com/stories/11193 |date=2008-06-30}}</ref> The biscuits have also been marketed as a pet care product to control flatulence in pets, and as aids to digestion or stomach problems in humans.<ref name=jDisley>{{Cite book |first=John |last=Disley |title=CharcoalRemedies.com | publisher=Remnant Publications |isbn=978-0-9738464-0-9 |year=2006 }}</ref>

==Cultural references==
In ''[[Brideshead Revisited]]'', [[Evelyn Waugh]] writes of Charles Ryder consuming charcoal biscuits and [[iced coffee]] while cramming for exams at [[Oxford]]. [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] is said to have eaten very little else while staying in Ireland.<ref>Ray Monk, ''Ludwig Wittgenstein: The Duty of Genius'', New York, Penguin, 1990, p. 522.</ref>

Several of [[Terry Pratchett]]'s ''[[Discworld]]'' books mention charcoal biscuits.  In ''Hogfather'' they are a restorative for the God of Indigestion.  In ''Reaper Man'', they are implicated in the explosive death of Mustrum Ridcully's uncle.  In ''Men At Arms'', they are a treat for a small dragon, and in ''Guards! Guards!'' another small dragon in danger of being flamed by a much larger dragon looks "as though he might be turned into a small flying charcoal biscuit".

In August 2012, charcoal biscuits were featured in the dessert round of an episode of the ''[[Chopped (TV series)|Chopped: Grillmasters]]'' tournament on [[Food Network]].
