The '''2010s Haiti cholera outbreak''' was the first modern large-scale outbreak of [[cholera]]—a [[disease]] once considered beaten back largely due to the invention of modern [[sanitation]]. The disease was reintroduced to Haiti in October 2010, not long after the disastrous [[2010 Haitian earthquake|earthquake]] earlier that year, and since then cholera has spread across the country and become [[Endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]], causing high levels of both [[morbidity]] and [[mortality rate|mortality]].<ref name="Piarroux 1161–1168">{{cite journal | vauthors = Piarroux R, Barrais R, Faucher B, Haus R, Piarroux M, Gaudart J, Magloire R, Raoult D | display-authors = 6 | title = Understanding the cholera epidemic, Haiti | journal = Emerging Infectious Diseases | volume = 17 | issue = 7 | pages = 1161–8 | date = July 2011 | pmid = 21762567 | pmc = 3381400 | doi = 10.3201/eid1707.110059 }}</ref> Nearly 800,000 Haitians have been infected by cholera, and more than 9,000 have died, according to the [[United Nations]] (UN).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.un.org/News/dh/infocus/haiti/Haiti_UN_System_Cholera.pdf|title=New UN System Approach to Cholera in Haiti|date=December 2016|publisher=United Nations|access-date=28 October 2018}}</ref> Cholera transmission in Haiti today{{when|date=August 2023}} is largely a function of eradication efforts including WASH (water, sanitation, and hygiene), education, oral vaccination,<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Gelting R, Bliss K, Patrick M, Lockhart G, Handzel T | title = Water, sanitation and hygiene in Haiti: past, present, and future | journal = The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene | volume = 89 | issue = 4 | pages = 665–670 | date = October 2013 | pmid = 24106193 | pmc = 3795096 | doi = 10.4269/ajtmh.13-0217 }}</ref><ref name=":0">{{cite journal | vauthors = Aibana O, Franke MF, Franke M, Teng JE, Teng J, Hilaire J, Raymond M, [[Louise Ivers|Ivers LC]]| display-authors = 6 | title = Cholera vaccination campaign contributes to improved knowledge regarding cholera and improved practice relevant to waterborne disease in rural Haiti | journal = PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases | volume = 7 | issue = 11 | pages = e2576 | date = November 2013 | pmid = 24278498 | pmc = 3837010 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pntd.0002576 }}</ref> and climate variability.<ref name=":1">{{cite journal | vauthors = Jutla A, Whitcombe E, Hasan N, Haley B, Akanda A, Huq A, Alam M, Sack RB, Colwell R | display-authors = 6 | title = Environmental factors influencing epidemic cholera | journal = The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene | volume = 89 | issue = 3 | pages = 597–607 | date = September 2013 | pmid = 23897993 | pmc = 3771306 | doi = 10.4269/ajtmh.12-0721 }}</ref> Early efforts were made to cover up the source of the epidemic, but thanks largely to the investigations of journalist [[Jonathan M.

== Outbreak ==
Cholera is caused by the bacterium ''[[Vibrio cholerae]]'' that when ingested can cause diarrhea and vomiting within several hours to 2–3 days. Without proper treatment including oral rehydration, cholera can be fatal. The suspected source of ''Vibrio cholerae'' in Haiti was the [[Artibonite River]], from which most of the affected people had consumed the water.<ref name="msnbc_23oct">{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/39787756|title=Cholera cases found in Haiti capital|date=23 October 2010|work=NBC News|access-date=9 November 2010}}</ref> Each year, tens of thousands of Haitians bathe, wash their clothes and dishes, obtain drinking water, and recreate in this river, therefore resulting in high rates of exposure to ''Vibrio cholerae''.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://news.un.org/en/story/2011/05/374052-un-set-taskforce-wake-report-source-haitian-cholera-outbreak|title=UN to set up taskforce in wake of report into source of Haitian cholera outbreak|date=2011-05-04|work=UN News|access-date=2018-10-29}}</ref>

For three months, UN officials, the CDC, and others argued against investigating the source of the outbreak. Gregory Hartl, a spokesman for the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), said finding the cause of the outbreak was "not important". Hartl said, "Right now, there is no active investigation. I cannot say one way or another [if there will be]. It is not something we are thinking about at the moment. What we are thinking about is the public health response in Haiti."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/39996103|title=Experts ask: Did U.N. troops infect Haiti?| vauthors = Katz JM | agency = Associated Press|date=3 November 2010|work=NBC News|access-date=9 November 2010}}</ref> Jordan Tappero, the lead [[epidemiologist]] at the CDC, said the main task was to control the outbreak, not to look for the source of the bacteria and that "we may never know the actual origin of this cholera strain."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/americas/2010/11/201011245450543862.html|title=Haiti's cholera 'from South Asia'|date=2 November 2010|publisher=[[Al Jazeera]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101109045612/http://english.aljazeera.net/news/americas/2010/11/201011245450543862.html|archive-date=9 November 2010 |url-status=live|access-date=9 November 2010}}</ref> A CDC spokesperson, Kathryn Harben, added that "at some point in the future, when many different analyses of the strain are complete, it may be possible to identify the origin of the strain causing the outbreak in Haiti."<ref name="web.archive.org"/>

[[Paul Farmer]], co-founder of the medical organization [[Partners In Health]], and a UN official himself who served [[Bill Clinton]]'s deputy at the [[Office of the Special Envoy for Haiti]], told the AP's Katz on 3 November 2010 that there was no reason to wait. Farmer stated, "The idea that we'd never know is not very likely. There's got to be a way to know the truth without pointing fingers."<ref name="web.archive.org"/> A cholera expert, John Mekalanos, supported the assertion that it was important to know where and how the disease emerged because the strain is a "novel, virulent strain previously unknown in the Western Hemisphere and health officials need to know how it spreads."<ref name="web.archive.org"/>

Some US professors have disagreed with the contention that [[Nepalese soldiers]] caused the outbreak. Some said it was more likely dormant cholera bacteria had been aroused by various environmental incidents in Haiti.<ref name="guardian 22 nov">{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/nov/22/haiti-cholera-un-weather|title=Haiti's cholera epidemic caused by weather, say scientists|date=22 November 2010|newspaper=The Guardian|location=UK|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101125084330/http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2010/nov/22/haiti-cholera-un-weather|archive-date=25 November 2010 |url-status=live|access-date=22 November 2010| vauthors = Hurtado ME }}</ref> Before studying the case, they said a sequence of events, including changes in climate triggered by the [[El Niño-Southern Oscillation|La Niña]] climate pattern and unsanitary living conditions for those affected by the earthquake, triggered bacteria already present in the water and soil to multiply and infect humans.<ref name="guardian 22 nov" />

However, a study unveiled in December and conducted by French [[epidemiologist]] [[Renaud Piarroux]] contended that UN troops from Nepal, rather than environmental factors, had started the epidemic as waste from outhouses at their base flowed into and contaminated the Artibonite River.<ref name="bbc7dec">{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-11943902|title=Haiti cholera: UN peacekeepers to blame, report says|date=7 December 2010|newspaper=BBC News|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101208043656/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-11943902|archive-date=8 December 2010|url-status=live|access-date=8 December 2010}}</ref> A separate study published in December in the ''New England Journal of Medicine'' presented DNA sequence data for the Haitian cholera isolate, finding that it was most closely related to a cholera strain found in Bangladesh in 2002 and 2008.

Under intense pressure, the UN relented, and said it would appoint a panel to investigate the source of the cholera strain.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://seattletimes.com/html/nationworld/2013703115_apununhaiti.html|title=UN panel to investigate Haiti cholera outbreak.|date=17 December 2010|agency=[[Associated Press]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130728162239/http://seattletimes.com/html/nationworld/2013703115_apununhaiti.html|archive-date=28 July 2013|url-status=live|access-date=20 December 2010}}</ref> That panel's report, issued in May 2011, confirmed substantial evidence that the Nepalese troops had brought the disease to Haiti. The [[U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) utilized [[DNA fingerprinting]] to tests various samples of cholera from Haitian patients to pinpoint the specific strand of cholera found in Haiti. During an epidemiological outbreak investigation, DNA fingerprinting of bacteria can be extremely helpful in identifying the source of an outbreak. The results of the CDC tests showed that the specific strain of cholera found in samples taken from Haitian patients was ''Vibrio cholerae'' serogroup O1, serotype Ogawa, a strain found in South Asia.<ref name="UNReport">{{cite news|url=https://www.un.org/News/dh/infocus/haiti/UN-cholera-report-final.pdf|title=Final Report of the Independent Panel of Experts on the Cholera Outbreak in Haiti|access-date=9 September 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120915215109/http://www.un.org/News/dh/infocus/haiti/UN-cholera-report-final.pdf|archive-date=15 September 2012|url-status=live|agency=WHO}}</ref> This specific strain of cholera is endemic in Nepal, therefore supporting the Haitian suspicion that Nepalese peacekeepers were the source of the outbreak.

[[Rita Colwell]], former director of the [[National Science Foundation]] and climate change expert, still contends that climate changes were an important factor in cholera's spread, stating in an interview with UNEARTH News in August 2013 that the outbreak was "triggered by a complicated set of factors. The precipitation and temperatures were above average during 2010 and that, in conjunction with a destroyed water and sanitation infrastructure, can be considered to have contributed to this major disease outbreak."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://unearthnews.org/un-peacekeepers-or-climate-change-the-complex-factors-contributing-to-haitis-cholera-crisis/|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130811102746/http://unearthnews.org/un-peacekeepers-or-climate-change-the-complex-factors-contributing-to-haitis-cholera-crisis/|url-status=dead|archive-date=11 August 2013|title=UN peacekeepers or climate change?

== Vulnerabilities ==
=== Infrastructure ===
Before the outbreak, Haiti suffered from relatively poor public health and sanitation infrastructure. In 2002, Haiti was ranked 147th out of 147 countries for [[water security]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = [[Louise Ivers|Ivers LC]], Farmer P, Almazor CP, Léandre F | title = Five complementary interventions to slow cholera: Haiti | journal = Lancet | volume = 376 | issue = 9758 | pages = 2048–51 | date = December 2010 | pmid = 21146206 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(10)62243-X | s2cid = 74151782 }}</ref> As of 2008, 37% of Haiti's population lacked access to adequate drinking water, and 83% lacked improved sanitation facilities.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/publications/9789241563956/en/|title=Progress on sanitation and drinking water: Joint Monitoring Programme 2010 update|author1=World Health Organization|author2=United Nation Children's Fund|year=2010|page=43|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170806074735/http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/publications/9789241563956/en/|archive-date=6 August 2017|url-status=dead|access-date=1 August 2017}}</ref> As such, families often obtain their water from natural sources, such as rivers, that may be contaminated with ''V. cholerae.'' Poor sanitation infrastructure allows cholera bacterium to enter these waterways. Persons are subsequently infected via the fecal-oral route when the water is used for drinking and cooking, and poor hygiene often contributes to the spread of cholera through the household or community.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Nelson EJ, Harris JB, Morris JG, Calderwood SB, Camilli A | title = Cholera transmission: the host, pathogen and bacteriophage dynamic | journal = Nature Reviews.

=== Physiological ===
Malnutrition of the population, another pre-existing condition that was exacerbated by the earthquake, may have also contributed to the severity of the outbreak.<ref name="Barzilay 599–609"/> Research from previous outbreaks shows that duration of diarrhea can be prolonged by up to 70% in individuals suffering from severe malnutrition.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Palmer DL, Koster FT, Alam AK, Islam MR | title = Nutritional status: a determinant of severity of diarrhea in patients with cholera | journal = The Journal of Infectious Diseases | volume = 134 | issue = 1 | pages = 8–14 | date = July 1976 | pmid = 820813 | doi = 10.1093/infdis/134.1.8 | jstor = 30107125 }}</ref> Furthermore, Haitians had no biological immunity to the strain of cholera introduced since they had no previous exposure to it. Therefore, physiological factors including malnutrition and lack of immunity may have allowed cholera to spread rapidly throughout the country.<ref name=":0" />

=== Information ===
Lack of information and limited access to some rural areas can also be a barrier to care. Some aid agencies have reported that mortality and morbidity tolls may be higher than the official figures because the government does not track deaths in rural areas where people never reached a hospital or emergency treatment center.<ref name="uscatholic1">{{cite web|url=http://www.uscatholic.org/news/2010/11/haiti-cholera-toll-rises-medical-supplies-are-rushed-victims|title=Haiti cholera toll rises as medical supplies are rushed to victims|publisher=US Catholic|access-date=17 November 2010|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101121093817/http://www.uscatholic.org/news/2010/11/haiti-cholera-toll-rises-medical-supplies-are-rushed-victims|archive-date=21 November 2010}}</ref> Limitations in the data from Haiti stem from a lack of pre-outbreak lack of surveillance infrastructure and laboratories to properly test samples and diagnose cases.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Fitter DL, Delson DB, Guillaume FD, Schaad AW, Moffett DB, Poncelet JL, Lowrance D, Gelting R | display-authors = 6 | title = Applying a New Framework for Public Health Systems Recovery following Emergencies and Disasters: The Example of Haiti following a Major Earthquake and Cholera Outbreak | journal = The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene | volume = 97 | issue = 4_Suppl | pages = 4–11 | date = October 2017 | pmid = 29064359 | pmc = 5676637 | doi = 10.4269/ajtmh.16-0862 }}</ref> Haiti was tasked with developing surveillance systems and laboratories after the 2010 earthquake and cholera outbreak which caused difficulties tracking the progression and scale of the outbreak.

Also, because of lack of laboratory confirmation for the vast majority of cases of cholera, it is possible that other diarrheal diseases were being falsely classified as cholera.<ref name="Barzilay 599–609"/>

=== Environmental ===
Rainy seasons and hurricanes continue to cause a temporary spike in incident cases and deaths. Moreover, as a result of global warming and climate change, Haiti is at an increased risk of cholera transmission. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) advances that global warming between 1.5–2 degrees Celsius will very likely lead to an increase in frequency and intensity of natural disasters and extreme weather events.<ref name=":3">{{Cite web|url=https://www.ipcc.ch/news_and_events/pr_181008_P48_spm.shtml|title=IPCC – Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|website=ipcc.ch|access-date=2018-10-30|archive-date=27 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181027221348/http://www.ipcc.ch/news_and_events/pr_181008_P48_spm.shtml|url-status=dead}}</ref> Resource-poor countries are poised to be affected more so than more developed and economically secure countries.<ref name=":3" />

Environmental factors such as temperature increases, severe weather events, and natural disasters have a two-fold impact on the transmission potential of cholera in Haiti: 1) they present conditions favorable to the persistence and growth of ''V. cholerae'' in the environment, and 2) they devastate a country's infrastructure and strain public health and health care resources.<ref name=":1" /> An exhaustive study into environmental factors influencing the spread of cholera in Haiti cites above average air temperatures following the earthquake, "anomalously high rainfall" from September to October 2010, and damage to the limited water and sanitation infrastructure as likely converging to create conditions favorable to a cholera outbreak.<ref name=":1" />

== Challenges and solutions to eradication ==
Hundreds of thousands of dollars have been dedicated towards eradicating cholera in Haiti since its introduction in 2010, yet unsanitary conditions and climate-driven forces allow cholera transmission to continue. While the number of new cases of cholera has drastically decreased from 2010, and is currently the lowest it has been since the outbreak began, the incidence remains at 25.5 per 100,000 population as of October 2018''.''<ref name=":2" /> Over time, there has been significant progress in the reduction of caseloads and overall number of deaths. According to one PAHO/WHO report, "the cumulative case-fatality rate (CFR) has remained around 1% since 2011".<ref name=":2" /> These achievements can be contributed to intensified international and local medical efforts and an increased emphasis on preventative measures, including improved sanitation, such as latrines, and changes in Haitian behaviors such as treating water, thoroughly cooking food, and rigorous hand-washing. &nbsp;Despite these progresses, cholera remains endemic in Haiti, and further resources are needed to fully eradicate it.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/cholera/haiti/index.html}}</ref>

After former UN Secretary General Ban Ki Moon accepted UN responsibility for the introduction of cholera in Haiti in December 2016, Moon projected a necessary $400 million in funding over two years in order to fully eradicate cholera in Haiti.<ref name=":4">{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/articles/2016-12-05/righting-wrong-haiti|title=Righting a wrong in Haiti {{!}} United Nations Secretary-General|publisher=United Nations|access-date=2018-10-30}}</ref>&nbsp; The Government of Haiti has dedicated itself to the complete eradication of cholera from Haiti by 2022 as presented in the Cholera Elimination Plan (PNEC) 2013 – 2022. UN Secretary-General [[António Guterres]], successor to [[Ban Ki-moon]], took up Ban's commitment to assist Haiti in the eradication of cholera when he took office on 31 December 2016, as demonstrated by strategic objective 2 of the 2017– 2018 Haiti Revised Humanitarian Plan. Strategic objective 2 reads, "Save lives from epidemics – Reduce mortality and morbidity due to cholera outbreaks and other waterborne diseases through the reduction of vulnerability, strengthening of epidemiological surveillance and ensuring of rapid and effective response".<ref name=":5">{{Cite web|url=http://ht.one.un.org/content/dam/unct/haiti/docs/HRP%202018/2018_Haiti_HRP_Final.pdf|title=2017 – 2018 Haiti Revised Humanitarian Plan|last=United Nations|year=2017|publisher=United Nations|access-date=18 October 2018|archive-date=30 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181030090748/http://ht.one.un.org/content/dam/unct/haiti/docs/HRP%202018/2018_Haiti_HRP_Final.pdf|url-status=dead}}</ref>&nbsp; The 2017 – 2018 Haiti Revised Humanitarian Plan identifies 1.9 million people in need of assistance for the protection from cholera, of which, 1.5 million people are targeted through programming totaling US$21.7 million.<ref name=":5" />&nbsp; Currently, the UN and Government of Haiti are on target to reach the 2016 – 2018 midterm goal to reduce the incidence of cholera to less than 0.1% by the end of 2018.<ref name=":2" />&nbsp;However, any disruption in funding of support services may result in a spike in transmission and the interruption of the downward trend.{{citation needed|date=January 2021}}

=== Challenges ===
==== Protracted crises: Hurricane Matthew 2016 ====
The first challenge to the eradication of cholera in Haiti is the country's vulnerability to disasters, putting it in a state of protracted crises. The climax of cholera incidence in Haiti was in 2011 with 352,000 new cases following the introduction of cholera in Haiti in late 2010.<ref name=":5" /> Incidence rates gradually declined until 2016 when there was another spike in the transmission and incidence of cholera following Hurricane Matthew's destruction in Haiti from 2–5 October 2016.<ref name=":5" /> There was a rise in cholera incidence from 32,000 new cases in 2015 to 42,000 new cases in 2016.<ref name=":5" /> By re-damaging Haiti's fragile water and sanitation infrastructure, Hurricane Matthew allowed cholera to rear its head. These figures demonstrate that the fight against cholera in Haiti, while improving, is on unstable ground. This indicates that while eradication efforts have largely been focused on vaccination and community education to prevent transmission, and oral rehydration to reduce mortality, the underlying vulnerabilities that perpetuate the disaster remain, particularly insufficient and unequal access to improved water and sanitation.<ref>{{cite web |title=Cholera- Global Situation |url=https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2022-DON426 |website=World Health Organization |access-date=2 June 2023}}</ref>

==== Funding ====
While the Government of Haiti's Cholera Elimination Plan (PNEC) 2013 – 2022 and the New UN System Approach on Cholera in Haiti (see solutions below for more information) lay out plans for the elimination of cholera in Haiti by 2022, these are entirely dependent on funding. In former Secretary General Moon's 5 December 2016 remarks he says, "Without political will and financial support from the membership of the United Nations, we have only good intentions and words. Words are powerful – but they cannot replace action and material support".<ref name=":4" />&nbsp; Due to the infectious nature of cholera, any lapse in funding for programming will likely result in setbacks in elimination.<ref>{{cite web |title=Cholera- Global Situation |url=https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2022-DON426 |website=World Health Organization |access-date=2 June 2023}}</ref>

As of 2017, funding for cholera is at risk due to increasing food insecurity and shelter needs for Haitian refugees returning from the Dominican Republic. In the 2017 – 2018 Revised Haiti Humanitarian Plan, funding requirements for cholera programming is the third largest at $21.7 million, behind $76.6 million for food security and $103.8 million for shelter/NFI needs.<ref name=":5" />

=== Solutions ===
==== Vaccination campaigns ====
In 2013, the Government of Haiti launched an oral cholera vaccination (OCV) campaign in two regions: Cerca Carvajal and Petite Anse. These regions were chosen because of particularly high attack rates, sanitation infrastructure, and access to healthcare. This vaccination effort was slightly controversial because the WHO guidelines at the time did not encourage mass vaccination campaigns in areas where outbreaks had already occurred.<ref name=":6">{{cite journal | title = Cholera vaccine: WHO position paper, August 2017 - Recommendations | journal = Vaccine | volume = 36 | issue = 24 | pages = 3418–3420 | date = June 2018 | pmid = 29555219 | doi = 10.1016/j.vaccine.2017.09.034 | last1 = World Health Organization | s2cid = 4063108 }}</ref> Prior to the 2010 outbreak in Haiti, vaccination campaigns were thought to detract from more important prevention measures like water treatment and good hygiene.<ref name=":7">{{cite journal | vauthors = Childs L, François J, Choudhury A, Wannemuehler K, Dismer A, Hyde TB, Yen CY, Date KA, Juin S, Katz MA, Kantor EF, Routh J, Etheart M, Wright T, Adrien P, Tohme RA | display-authors = 6 | title = Evaluation of Knowledge and Practices Regarding Cholera, Water Treatment, Hygiene, and Sanitation Before and After an Oral Cholera Vaccination Campaign-Haiti, 2013-2014 | journal = The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene | volume = 95 | issue = 6 | pages = 1305–1313 | date = December 2016 | pmid = 27799642 | pmc = 5154444 | doi = 10.4269/ajtmh.16-0555 }}</ref> Relative success rates (up to 65% or higher protective effectiveness 5 years after vaccination<ref name=":7" />) in recent vaccination campaigns in Haiti and other countries affected by cholera has led to more widespread use of oral cholera vaccine programs and a change in the WHO guidelines to encourage use of vaccines in addition to other prevention and treatment strategies.<ref name=":6" />

==== UN approach ====
At the end of 2016, former UN Secretary General Ban Ki Moon presented the "New UN System Approach on Cholera in Haiti".<ref name=":4" /> This two-track approach marked the UN's acceptance of responsibility for the introduction of cholera in Haiti and demonstrated its commitment to the eradication of the disease in Haiti. Since the 2016 admission of guilt, there has been increased coordination and goodwill between the Government of Haiti and UN, resulting in great strides towards the elimination of cholera. 2017 was a hallmark year in the elimination of cholera from Haiti. The 2017 – 2018 Haiti Revised Humanitarian Plan reports, "As of 31 December 2017, 13,682 suspected cholera cases and 150 deaths had been registered in the country in 2017 compared to 41,955 cases and 451 deaths for the same period in 2016, a decrease of 67% in both cases".<ref name=":5" />&nbsp;Newly developed rapid response teams are largely to credit for the reduction in disease incidence.{{citation needed|date=January 2021}}

The ability for the humanitarian sector to act quickly and bounce back following Hurricane Matthew in 2016, as well as to maintain the downward trend during the heavy rain season, demonstrates progress in the eradication of cholera in Haiti.{{citation needed|date=January 2021}}

===== Track 1 =====
Track 1 of the New UN System Approach on Cholera in Haiti aims to "intensify efforts to respond to and reduce the incidence of cholera in Haiti" through three main projects.<ref name=":8">{{Cite web|url=http://www.un.org/News/dh/infocus/haiti/Haiti_UN_System_Cholera.pdf|title=New UN System Approach on Cholera in Haiti|last=United Nations|date=December 2016|publisher=United Nations|access-date=20 October 2018}}</ref>&nbsp; The first is strengthening and supporting the rapid response framework developed by the Haitian Government which deploys to communities where cholera is suspected within 48-hours. There are currently 13 government led rapid response teams, and 60 mobile teams of humanitarian actors that support the rapid response teams.<ref name=":5" /> The goal of rapid response teams is to cut the transmission of cholera by first setting up a perimeter called a ''[[Cordon sanitaire (medicine)|cordon sanitaire]]'' and investigating the source of the outbreak at the household level. This investigation is coupled with education and awareness raising on cholera prevention, administering oral prophylaxis and distribution of WASH kits.<ref name=":5" />&nbsp; If an outbreak is confirmed, temporary chlorination points are installed on community water sources. People treated for cholera by the rapid response teams are then recruited to Community Engagement & Hygiene Awareness (CEHA) teams. The CEHA teams return to their communities to conduct outreach and sensitization on how to cut transmission and assist the government in monitoring water sources. This rapid response design with the assistance of the CEHA teams is responsible for a major decline in disease incidence in the Ouest department in 2017.<ref name=":5" /> As long as funding continues to support rapid response, a continued decline in disease incidence can be suspected. &nbsp;{{citation needed|date=January 2021}}

The second project of track 1 is the continued support of oral cholera vaccination campaigns as a preventative measure.<ref name=":8" />&nbsp; In 2018, the oral cholera vaccine campaign will focus on departments with the highest incidence of disease, particularly Artibonite and Centre departments.<ref name=":5" />

The final aim of track 1 is to "more effectively address… the medium/longer term issues of water, sanitation and health systems".<ref name=":8" />&nbsp; The 2010 earthquake and subsequent cholera outbreak/epidemic exposed to the international community how vulnerable the Haitian water, sanitation, and health infrastructure was. Cholera and other water-borne diseases will continue to circulate in Haiti as long as large sections of their population do not have access to improved water and sanitation facilities. As part of the UN's "New Way of Working" which aims to bridge the development and humanitarian gap, the UN will be working with major development actors including the World Bank and the International Development Bank to address infrastructure vulnerabilities that put Haiti at risk of protracted crisis.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.unocha.org/sites/unocha/files/NWOW%20Booklet%20low%20res.002_0.pdf|title=New Way of Working|last=UNOCHA|year=2016|website=UNOCHA.org|access-date=20 October 2018}}</ref> The "New Way of Working" aims to draw from funding sources on both sides of the spectrum, both development and humanitarian, to work towards the Sustainable Development Goals.&nbsp; No joint funded projects have been reported in Haiti yet.{{citation needed|date=January 2021}}

===== Track 2 =====
The second track of the New UN System Approach on Cholera in Haiti proposes to provide material assistance to individuals and families who were most affected by cholera.<ref name=":8" />&nbsp; The material assistance package is the UN's attempt at reparations after accepting responsibility for the introduction of cholera in Haiti. The UN reports, "nearly 800,000 Haitians have been infected by cholera since 2010 [as of 2016] and more than 9,000 have died".<ref name=":8" />&nbsp; First, consultations will be conducted with the community to identify what materials will be of greatest impact.{{citation needed|date=January 2021}}

           In 2015, Haiti had more reported cases of cholera per population than any other country and in 2016 Hurricane Matthew added a new urgency to mitigating the suffering in Haiti due to Cholera.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ivers LC | title = Eliminating Cholera Transmission in Haiti | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 376 | issue = 2 | pages = 101–103 | date = January 2017 | pmid = 27959699 | pmc = 5963537 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMp1614104 }}</ref> In the same year the UN apologized to the Haitian people for the epidemic, after scientific studies linked the cholera epidemic to UN peacekeepers that were not screened for the disease prior to their arrival in Haiti after the earthquake. and pledged to provide 400 million dollars in two years to implement "Track 1" and "Track 2" aimed at providing water sanitation and improved access to treatment<ref name="auto"/> and material assistance to Haitians affected by the cholera epidemic respectively.

While to date only 5% of the funds for these tracks have been raised ongoing humanitarian efforts by the UN, other NGO's, and the Haitian government the new cases of Cholera have drastically decreased in the last 5 years.  A series of studies from 2013 to 2016 proved that the combination of chlorination and cholera vaccination could eliminate cholera in one of the poorest areas in Haiti.<ref name = "Lee_2020" /> After Hurricane Matthew in 2016, the WHO and other technical partners developed teams to investigate the scale of cholera outbreaks.<ref name="gavi.org">{{Cite web|title=Gavi provides support for emergency cholera vaccine campaign in Haiti|url=https://www.gavi.org/news/media-room/gavi-provides-support-emergency-cholera-vaccine-campaign-haiti|access-date=2020-12-15|website=www.gavi.org|language=en}}</ref> Then in October 2016, the Haitian Ministry of Public Health and Population requested and received 1 million doses of the oral cholera vaccine, partially funded by Gavi, the vaccine alliance.<ref name="pmid27959699">{{cite journal | vauthors = Ivers LC | title = Eliminating Cholera Transmission in Haiti | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 376 | issue = 2 | pages = 101–103 | date = January 2017 | pmid = 27959699 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMp1614104 | pmc = 5963537 | doi-access = free }}</ref><ref name="gavi.org"/> The WHO and other partners including UNICEF, International Medical Corps, the Red Cross and Gavi, the vaccine alliance teams reached over 729,000 people most affected by Hurricane Matthew.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Cholera vaccination campaign for Haitians hardest hit by Hurricane Matthew|url=https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail/cholera-vaccination-campaign-for-haitians-hardest-hit-by-hurricane-matthew|access-date=2020-12-15|website=www.who.int|language=en}}</ref> These and ongoing efforts by the Haitian government and humanitarian aid have only continued to decrease the number of cholera cases in Haiti.
