'''Discolysis''', also called '''chemonucleolysis''' or '''nucleolysis''', is a treatment for a herniated disc that seeks to alleviate associated neurological symptoms through enzymatic or chemical destruction or softening of the nucleus pulposis. <ref>{{cite book |last1=Kraemer |first1=Juergen |last2=Hasenbring |first2=Monika |last3=Kraemer |first3=Robert |last4=Taub |first4=Ethan |last5=Theodoridis |first5=Theodoros |last6=Wilke |first6=Hans-Joachim |title=Intervertebral disk diseases : causes, diagnosis, treatment, and prophylaxis |date=2009 |publisher=Thieme |location=Stuttgart |isbn=978-3-13-582403-1 |page=7 |edition=3rd}}</ref> The procedure was first reported by [[Lyman W. Smith]] in 1964, and used [[chymopapain]].

Discolysis has also been used to describe a form of [[ozone therapy]] where an oxygen-ozone solution is injected into the intervertebral disc. This method is not well-accepted in part due to a lack of standardization of technique, training and equipment.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Travagli |first1=Valter |last2=Bocci |first2=Velio |last3=Borrelli |first3=Emma |last4=Zanardi |first4=Iacopo |title=The usefulness of ozone treatment in spinal pain |journal=Drug Design, Development and Therapy |date=May 2015 |volume=9 |pages=2677–2685 |doi=10.2147/DDDT.S74518 |pmid=26028964|pmc=4440430 |doi-access=free }}</ref> In the United States, the procedure lacks FDA approval.<ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Varshney |editor1-first=Manish Kumar |last1=Jadon |first1=Ashok |last2=Mehta |first2=Palak |title=Essential orthopedics : principles and practice |date=2016 |publisher=Jaypee Bros. |location=New Delhi |isbn=978-93-5250-175-5 |page=1380 |chapter=Interventional Techniques for Diagnosis and Treatment of Back Pain}}</ref> The authors of a 2018 systematic review noted that only a small number of poor-quality studies on the effects of ozone discolysis in the low back were available, and while they reported efficacy, potentially serious complications were underreported. The authors concluded that ozone discolysis required more study with "adequate and consistent methodologies".<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Costa |first1=T. |last2=Linhares |first2=D. |last3=Ribeiro da Silva |first3=M. |last4=Neves |first4=N. |title=Ozone therapy for low back pain: A systematic review |journal=Acta Reumatológica Portuguesa |date=2018 |volume=43 |issue=3 |pages=172–181 |pmid=30414366 |url=http://www.actareumatologica.pt/article_download.php?id=1331}}</ref>
