'''''Rabbit vesivirus'' (RaV)''' is a ''[[Caliciviridae]]'' virus that was first isolated in the Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory at [[Oregon State University]], from the feces of rabbits suffering from [[gastrointestinal disease]]. The virus is a non-enveloped, isometric virus with diameter of around 30 nanometer.

Its viral genome is 8,295 [[Nucleotide|nucleotides]] in size, consisting of [[Positive-strand RNA virus|positive single-stranded RNA]] with a small protein (VPg) [[Covalent bond|covalently]] linked to its 5′ terminus and a 3′ poly-A tail with an average length of 85 nucleotides. The genome comprises three [[Open reading frame|open reading frames]], the most 5′ of which encodes a 1,880 amino acid [[proteolysis]] that yields the non-structural polypeptides upon self-cleavage. The ''vesivirus'' is the only genus of which all members are cultivable.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Álvarez |first=Ángel L. |last2=García-Manso |first2=Alberto |last3=Dalton |first3=Kevin P. |last4=Martín-Alonso |first4=José M. |last5=Nicieza |first5=Inés |last6=Podadera |first6=Ana |last7=Acosta-Zaldívar |first7=Maikel |last8=de Llano |first8=Daniel |last9=Parra |first9=Francisco |date=2020 |title=Reverse Genetics System for Rabbit vesivirus |url=https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2020.596245 |journal=Frontiers in Microbiology |volume=11 |doi=10.3389/fmicb.2020.596245/full |issn=1664-302X}}{{Creative Commons text attribution notice|cc=by4|from this source=yes}}</ref>
