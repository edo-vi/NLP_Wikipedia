'''Hypnodermatology''' is an informal label for the use of [[hypnosis]] in treating the skin conditions that fall between conventional medical [[dermatology]] and the mental health disciplines.

The use of hypnosis to provide relief for some skin conditions is based on observations that the severity of the disease may correlate with emotional issues. In addition, [[hypnotherapy]] has been used to suggest improvement on dermatological symptoms, such as chronic [[psoriasis]],<ref name="Tausk">{{Cite journal |last1=Tausk |first1=F. |last2=Whitmore |first2=S.

Philip D. Shenefelt, a research [[dermatologist]] at the [[University of South Florida College of Medicine|University of South Florida School of Medicine]], has identified two dozen dermatologic conditions that have shown response to hypnosis in the literature, with varying degrees of evidence. These include successful results in controlled trials on [[verruca vulgaris]], [[psoriasis]], and [[atopic dermatitis]].<ref name="Shenefelt">{{Cite book |last=Shenefelt |first=P.
