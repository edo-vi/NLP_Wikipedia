'''Bovine papular stomatitis''' is a [[farmyard pox]] caused by ''Bovine papular stomatitis virus'' (BPSV), which can spread from infected cattle to cause disease in milkers, farmers and veterinarians.<ref name=Andrew2020>{{cite book |last1=James |first1=William D. |last2=Elston |first2=Dirk |last3=Treat |first3=James R. |last4=Rosenbach |first4=Misha A. |last5=Neuhaus |first5=Isaac |title=Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: Clinical Dermatology |date=2020 |publisher=Elsevier |location=Edinburgh |isbn=978-0-323-54753-6 |page=389 |edition=13th |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UEaEDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA389 |language=en |chapter=19.

BPSV is a member of the family ''[[Poxviridae]]'' and the genus ''[[Parapoxvirus]]''. [[Pathogen transmission|Spread]] typically occurs by direct contact with the infected animal, but has been reported in people without direct contact.<ref name=Andrew2020/>

It may appear similar to [[foot-and-mouth disease]].<ref name=Carter/>

It occurs worldwide in [[cattle]].<ref name=Andrew2020/>

In other animals the lesions are reddish, raised, sometimes ulcerative lesions on the lips, muzzle, and in the mouth. It usually occurs before the age of two years.<ref name=Fenner_1993>{{cite book|author1=Fenner, Frank J. |author2=Gibbs, E.
