== Background ==
EvidenceNetwork.ca was established to address the complex debates leading up to the 2014 renegotiation of the Canada Health Accord, and after, to highlight evidence on health policy issues across the country. The Director, Dr, Roos, says, "Health policy issues are increasingly complex and are too often taken over by politics and ideology. We thought the best way to serve the Canadian public would be to create an accessible and reliable resource where journalists can quickly find independent experts and evidence on issues as they arise."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://umanitoba.ca/outreach/evidencenetwork/third-party-brokers |title=Third Party Brokers &#124; Evidence Network |publisher=Umanitoba.ca |date= |accessdate=2011-06-10 |archive-date=2011-09-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110921041401/http://umanitoba.ca/outreach/evidencenetwork/third-party-brokers |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=Lauren McKeon |url=http://www.j-source.ca/english_new/detail.php?id=6378 |title=The Canadian Journalism Project |publisher=J-Source.ca |date=2011-04-12 |accessdate=2011-06-10 |archive-date=2012-08-02 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120802222946/http://www.j-source.ca/english_new/detail.php?id=6378 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The site provides [[evidence-based medicine|evidence-based]] information on controversial health policy issues for journalists such as the sustainability of the health care system, the impact of the aging population,{{citation needed|date=December 2020}} the rising costs of drugs, accessibility and appropriateness of care, pharmaceutical policy, [[obesity]], [[mental health]], and the role of the private sector.
