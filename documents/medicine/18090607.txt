'''Pagtatawas''' is a [[divination]] ritual in pseudomedicine in [[Filipino Psychology]] (but considered superstition in Western psychology), carried out by the mangtatawas (literally "user of ''tawas''").<ref>{{cite web|title=BOOK REVIEWS|url=http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=293604|work=J.A.M.A., April 24, 1954, p. 1470|publisher=JAMA Network|access-date=28 November 2013}}</ref> It attempts to diagnose an affliction or psychological disorder by interpreting shapes produced in water by heated [[alum]] or molten wax droppings from a burning candle. It is thus a form of both [[carromancy]] and [[Methods_of_divination#O|oryctomancy]].

Earlier and in some rural areas in the Philippines, [[alum]] (i.e., hydrated [[aluminum potassium sulfate]] or ''tawas'' in the vernacular) is ritualistically used by the ''[[albularyo]]'' or medicine man to pinpoint a variety of health conditions: a child's incessant crying, frequent fatigue, or even failure to conceive. 

The ''tawas'' is used to trace the [[sign of the cross]] on the patient’s forehead and other suspicious or ailing parts of the body as prayers are being whispered (''bulóng'' or ''oración''). The alum is then placed on glowing embers, removed when it starts to crack, then transferred to a small basin of water.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sito.org/cgi-bin/egads/showart?show=jaf.0010&idonly=jaf&seq=0 |title=SITO Artchive: '''Pagtatawas''' by Jose A. Fadul |publisher=Sito.org |access-date=2010-10-11}}</ref> As it cools, the alum’s new form spreads on the water’s surface and assumes a shape that may suggest the cause of the illness, often one of several indigenous forces: dwarfs, demons, or other malevolent spirits (''na-nuno,'' ''na-kulam,'' ''na-demonyo''). The water is then used to anoint the ailing part or parts of the body to counteract the evil forces or illness. The ''tawas'' is then discarded and thrown westward, preferably towards the setting sun.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stuartxchange.com/Tawas.html |title=Tawas (Alum): Miscellaneous Therapies in Philippine Alternative Medicine |publisher=Stuartxchange.com |access-date=2010-10-11}}</ref>

Presently and in most areas, an ''albularyo'' simply lights and holds the candle during the ritual. In some, it is the ''albularyo'''s assistant or the afflicted person who holds the candle, but almost invariably, it is the ''albularyo'' who interprets the vague shapes produced by the wax as it re-solidifies in the basin of water. An ''albularyo'' may see supernatural beings displeased as cause of the illness in the shapes and forms, and suggest some cleansing ritual or peace offering to a spirit. 

Modern variations have the ''albularyo'' use other materials for divination, such as eggs, mirrors, blank paper, cigarettes,<ref>[http://www.senkotirosphilippines.com/Philippines/e-books/Special-Edition_Philippine_Healing-Arts.pdf FMAdigest] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724185657/http://www.senkotirosphilippines.com/Philippines/e-books/Special-Edition_Philippine_Healing-Arts.pdf |date=July 24, 2008 }}</ref> chewing gum, chicken feathers, and the liver of a freshly-slaughtered chicken or pig (the last one classically known in the West as [[haruspex|haruspicy]]).
