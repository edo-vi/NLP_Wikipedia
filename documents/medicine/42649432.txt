===Liver neurotoxicity===
A [[liver shunt]] is a congenital or acquired condition that may lead to toxicity and head pressing. Additional symptoms include drooling and slow maturation early in development. Middle-aged and older animals more commonly suffer from liver cirrhosis than younger animals.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pethealthnetwork.com/dog-health/dog-diseases-conditions-a-z/cirrhosis-dogs|title=Cirrhosis in Dogs|website=Pet Health Network|publisher=[[IDEXX Laboratories]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191212005907/https://www.pethealthnetwork.com/dog-health/dog-diseases-conditions-a-z/cirrhosis-dogs|archive-date=12 December 2019|access-date=12 December 2019}}</ref>

===Viral causes===
Several viruses that cause [[encephalitis]] or [[meningoencephalitis]] can lead to the neurological sign of head pressing, such as [[eastern equine encephalitis]] and ''[[Bovine alphaherpesvirus 5|bovine herpesvirus 5]]''.<ref name="McVeyKennedy2013">{{cite book|last=Hostetler|first=Douglas E.|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KcrUS1gaix0C&pg=PA573|title=Veterinary Microbiology|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|year=2013|isbn=978-1-118-65056-1|editor-last=McVey|editor-first=D.
