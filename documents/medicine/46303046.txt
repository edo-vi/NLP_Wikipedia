'''Joel D. Baines''' is an American virologist who is serving as dean of the School of Veterinary Medicine, [[Louisiana State University]] (LSU) since 2014.

Dr. Joel Baines (PhD, VMD) received a bachelor's degree in microbiology from [[Kansas State University]] in 1979, earned his VMD degree from the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in 1983 and PhD in molecular virology from [[Cornell University]] in 1988. He did postdoctoral research at the [[University of Chicago]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://vivo.cornell.edu/display/individual5419 |title=Joel D. Baines Profile on Cornell VIVO}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://virology.cornell.edu/faculty%20pages/faculty-baines.htm |title=Joel D. Baines Profile at Cornell}}</ref> Baines was a  James Law Professor of Virology in the Department of Microbiology and Immunology at Cornell. He was chosen as the sixth dean of LSU School of Veterinary Medicine in 2014 and holds the Dr. Kenneth F. Burns Chair in Veterinary Medicine.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www1.vetmed.lsu.edu/PBS/People/PBS%20Faculty/PBS%20Faculty%20Pages/item73183.html |title=LSU Department of Pathobiological Sciences Faculty Profile |access-date=2015-04-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150405194622/https://www1.vetmed.lsu.edu/PBS/People/PBS%20Faculty/PBS%20Faculty%20Pages/item73183.html |archive-date=2015-04-05 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://sites01.lsu.edu/wp/lovepurple/2014/11/19/joel-baines/ |title=LSU News Release}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.avma.org/News/JAVMANews/Pages/140401t.aspx |title=JAVMA News April 01, 2014}}</ref>

Throughout his career he has studied many molecular aspects of herpes virus infections.  During his postdoctoral research in Bernard Roizman's lab at the University of Chicago he identified UL10 as the HSV-1 gene that encodes glycoprotein M.  Since his postdoctoral work he has had 6500 citations of his over 90 peer reviewed research publications surrounding various aspects of HSV-1 replication.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=Baines+Herpesvirus |title=PubMed}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=RNA polymerase II Promoter Proximal Pausing and Release to Elongation are Key Steps Regulating Herpes Simplex Virus 1 Transcription|pmid = 31826988|year = 2020|last1 = Birkenheuer|first1 = C.
