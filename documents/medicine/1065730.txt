A '''vaccine trial''' is a [[clinical trial]] that aims at establishing the safety and [[vaccine efficacy|efficacy]] of a [[vaccine]] prior to it being licensed.<ref>{{cite book |first1=M. Elizabeth |last1=Halloran |author1-link=Betz Halloran |first2=Ira M. Jr. |last2=Longini |author2-link=Ira Longini |first3=Claudio J. |last3=Struchiner |title=Design and analysis of vaccine studies |publisher=Springer |series=Statistics for biology and health |location=New York |year=2010 |isbn=978-0-387-40313-7 |mr=2572061 }}{{pn|date=June 2021}}</ref>

A vaccine candidate drug is first identified through preclinical evaluations that could involve high throughput screening and selecting the proper [[antigen]] to invoke an immune response.

Some vaccine trials may take months or years to complete, depending on the time required for the subjects to react to the vaccine and develop the required [[Antibody|antibodies]].

==Preclinical stage==
[[Preclinical development]] stages are necessary to determine the immunogenicity potential and safety profile for a vaccine candidate.<ref>{{cite web |title=How are Vaccines Made? Vaccine Development, Testing, and Regulation |url=https://historyofvaccines.org/vaccines-101/how-are-vaccines-made/vaccine-development-testing-and-regulation |website=History of Vaccines |publisher=The College of Physicians of Philadelphia |access-date=12 December 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221210083559/https://historyofvaccines.org/vaccines-101/how-are-vaccines-made/vaccine-development-testing-and-regulation |archive-date=10 December 2022 |url-status=live}}</ref>

This is also the stage in which the drug candidate may be first tested in laboratory animals prior to moving to the [[Phases of clinical research#Phase I|Phase I]] trials. Vaccines such as the [[Polio vaccine|oral polio vaccine]] have been first tested for adverse effects and immunogenicity in monkeys as well as [[non-human primates]] and [[lab mice]].<ref name="TgmNVT_SOP">{{cite book |publisher=World Health Organization |year=2015 |series=Standard Operating Procedure |title=Neurovirulence Test of Types 1, 2 or 3 Live attenuated Poliomyelitis vaccines (Oral) in Transgenic Mice susceptible to Poliovirus |url=https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/neurovirulence-test-sop-of-types-1-2-or-3-opv-in-transgenic-mice-susceptible-to-poliovirus }}</ref>

Recent scientific advances have helped to use [[transgenic animals]] as a part of vaccine preclinical protocol in hopes to more accurately determine drug reactions in humans.<ref name="TgmNVT_SOP"/> Understanding vaccine safety and the [[immunological response]] to the vaccine, such as [[toxicity]], are necessary components of the preclinical stage. Other drug trials focus on the [[pharmacodynamics]] and [[pharmacokinetics]]; however, in vaccine studies it is essential to understand toxic effects at all possible dosage levels and the interactions with the immune system.

== Phase I ==

The Phase I study consists of introducing the vaccine candidate to assess its safety in healthy people. A vaccine Phase I trial involves normal healthy subjects, each tested with either the candidate vaccine or a "[[control group|control]]" treatment, typically a [[placebo-controlled studies|placebo]] or an [[adjuvant]]-containing cocktail, or an established vaccine (which might be intended to protect against a different [[pathogen]]). The primary observation is for detection of safety (absence of an [[adverse event]]) and evidence of [[immunogenicity|an immune response]].<ref name="fda-vpap">{{cite web |title=Vaccine product approval process |url=https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/development-approval-process-cber/vaccine-product-approval-process |publisher=US Food and Drug Administration |access-date=25 September 2020 |date=30 January 2018}}</ref>

After the administration of the vaccine or placebo, the researchers collect data on [[antibody]] production, on health outcomes (such as illness due to the targeted infection or to another infection). Following the [[protocol (natural sciences)|trial protocol]], the specified [[Statistical hypothesis testing|statistical test]] is performed to gauge the [[statistically significant|statistical significance]] of the observed differences in the outcomes between the treatment and control groups. [[Adverse effect (medicine)|Side effects]] of the vaccine are also noted, and these contribute to the decision on whether to advance the candidate vaccine to a Phase II trial.

One typical version of Phase I studies in vaccines involves an escalation study, which is used in mainly medicinal research trials. The drug is introduced into a small cohort of healthy volunteers. Vaccine escalation studies aim to minimize chances of serious adverse effects (SAE) by slowly increasing the drug dosage or frequency.<ref name=":1">{{cite journal |last1=Saul |first1=Allan |title=Models of Phase 1 vaccine trials: optimization of trial design to minimize risks of multiple serious adverse events |journal=Vaccine |date=April 2005 |volume=23 |issue=23 |pages=3068–3075 |doi=10.1016/j.vaccine.2004.10.048|pmid=15811654 |url=https://zenodo.org/record/1259419 }}</ref> The first level of an escalation study usually has two or three groups of around 10 healthy volunteers. Each subgroup receives the same vaccine dose, which is the expected lowest dose necessary to invoke an immune response (the main goal in a vaccine – to create [[Immunity (medical)|immunity]]). New subgroups can be added to experiment with a different dosing regimen as long as the previous subgroup did not experience SAEs. There are variations in the vaccination order that can be used for different studies. For example, the first subgroup could complete the entire regimen before the second subgroup starts or the second can begin before the first ends as long as SAEs were not detected.<ref name=":1" /> The vaccination schedule will vary depending on the nature of the drug (i.e. the need for a booster or several doses over the course of short time period). Escalation studies are ideal for minimizing risks for SAEs that could occur with less controlled and divided protocols.

== Phase II ==
The transition to [[Phases of clinical research#Phase II|Phase II]] relies on the [[Immunogenicity|immunogenic]] and toxicity results from Phase I in a small cohort of healthy volunteers.<ref name=":2">{{cite book |last1=Bloom |first1=Barry R. |last2=Lambert |first2=Paul-Henri |title=The Vaccine Book |date=2003 |publisher=Academic Press |isbn=978-0-12-107258-2 }}{{pn|date=June 2021}}</ref> Phase II will consist of more healthy volunteers in the vaccine target population (~ hundreds of people) to determine reactions in a more diverse set of humans and test different schedules.

==Phase III==
Similarly. [[Phases of clinical research#Phase III|Phase III]] trials continue to monitor toxicity, immunogenicity, and SAEs on a much larger scale.<ref name=":2" /> The vaccine must be shown to be safe and effective in natural disease conditions before being submitted for approval and then general production. In the United States, the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) is responsible for approving vaccines.<ref name=":3">{{Cite web|title = Biologics License Applications (BLA) Process (Biologics) – Vaccine Product Approval Process|url = https://www.fda.gov/biologicsbloodvaccines/developmentapprovalprocess/biologicslicenseapplicationsblaprocess/ucm133096.htm|website = www.fda.gov|access-date = 15 November 2015|first = Center for Biologics Evaluation and|last = Research}}</ref>

==Phase IV==
[[Phases of clinical research#Phase IV|Phase IV]] trials are typically monitor stages that collect information continuously on vaccine usage, adverse effects, and long-term immunity after the vaccine is licensed and marketed. Harmful effects, such as increased risk of liver failure or heart attacks, discovered by Phase IV trials may result in a drug being no longer sold, or restricted to certain uses; examples include [[cerivastatin]] (brand names Baycol and Lipobay), [[troglitazone]] (Rezulin) and [[rofecoxib]] (Vioxx).<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Sibbald |first1=B. |title=Rofecoxib (Vioxx) voluntarily withdrawn from market |journal=Canadian Medical Association Journal |date=2004-10-26 |volume=171 |issue=9 |pages=1027–1028 |doi=10.1503/cmaj.1041606 |pmid=15505253 |pmc=526313 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Faich |first1=Gerald A. |last2=Moseley |first2=Richard H. |title=Troglitazone (Rezulin) and hepatic injury |journal=Pharmacoepidemiology and Drug Safety |date=October 2001 |volume=10 |issue=6 |pages=537–547 |doi=10.1002/pds.652 |pmid=11828837 |s2cid=37579770 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Furberg |first1=Curt D |last2=Pitt |first2=Bertram |title=Withdrawal of cerivastatin from the world market |journal=Current Controlled Trials in Cardiovascular Medicine |date=2001 |volume=2 |issue=5 |pages=205–207 |doi=10.1186/cvm-2-5-205 |pmid=11806796 |pmc=59524 }}</ref> Further examples include the [[swine flu vaccine]] and the [[rotavirus vaccine]], which increased the risk of [[Guillain-Barré syndrome]] (GBS) and [[Intussusception (medical disorder)|intussusception]] respectively.<ref>Penina Haber, MPH; Frank DeStefano, MD, MPH; Fredrick J.
