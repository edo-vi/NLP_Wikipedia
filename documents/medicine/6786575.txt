'''Dislocation of hip''' (coxofemoral luxation) may occur '''in domestic animals'''.

It is a not rare condition, usually unilateral, in:
* cattle, among others, after calving.
* [[Hip dysplasia (canine)|dogs]], resulting from trauma or as a complication of [[Hip dysplasia (canine)|hip dysplasia]].

The same illness also exists in [[dislocation of hip|human medicine]].

The condition can be observed after the forced traction of fetus while delivery, slip of animal on a floor. 
More commonly seen in animals with poor nutrient ration at end stage of gestation which results in osteoporosis of bones & joints due go which acetabulum notch become shallow and femur comes out if it while delivery, ketonemia also has adverse effect on coxo-femoral luxation

==Symptoms==
In dogs, it occurs mainly in an upwards and forwards direction. Hence, the affected leg is shortened, and the [[greater trochanter]] prominent.

In cattle, it occurs mainly craniodorsally or caudoventrally, but other directions are possible. A typical stance is seen in craniodorsal luxations, with a shortened limb, and a protrusion of greater trochanter.

==Treatment==
Attempts in reduction in cattle are generally not successful. Affected animals, at least not too heavy ones, can live with the disease for a long time because of the formation of a sort of pseudo-joint in the hip.

Dogs with hip dysplasia and unilateral dislocation can live if the other leg is not too severely hit. Then there is a severe muscular atrophy of the  thigh. Compensation occurs with musculation of the shoulders.
