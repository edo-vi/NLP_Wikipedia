{{wiktionary}}
'''Enzootic''' is the non-human equivalent of [[Endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] and means, in a broad sense, "belonging to" or "native to", "characteristic of", or "prevalent in" a particular [[geography]], [[Race (biology)|race]], [[Field (agriculture)|field]], area, or [[Natural environment|environment]]; native to an area or scope.

It also has two specific meanings:

* an organism being "''enzootic''" means native to a place or a specific fauna
* in [[epizoology]], an infection is said to be "''enzootic''" in a population when the infection is maintained in the population without the need for external inputs (''cf''. [[Endemic (epidemiology)|Endemic]]).
