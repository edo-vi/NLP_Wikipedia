==Effects==
The United States [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) began counting the 2017–2018 "flu season" as October 2017, and by early February 2018, the epidemic was still widespread and increasing overall. By February 2018, the CDC said that the circulating virus strains included both B strains (Yamagata and Victoria), [[Influenza A virus subtype H1N1|H1N1]] and [[Influenza A virus subtype H3N2|H3N2]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/02/02/health/flu-weekly-surveillance-feb-2/index.html|title=16 more children dead from flu, CDC says|first=Susan |last=Scutti|date=2 February 2018 |publisher=CNN}}</ref> On 10 February 2018, ''Bloomberg'' reported that influenza in the United States was killing up to 4,000 Americans a week, likely to far outstrip the rate of deaths in the [[2009 swine flu pandemic in the United States|2009–2010 pandemic season]]. [[Anne Schuchat]], then-acting director of the CDC, said that the main type of the flu that year had not "changed enough from previous seasons to be considered a novel strain."<ref>{{cite news|last=Cortez|first=M.F.|date=10 February 2018|title=Flu Is Causing 1 in 10 American Deaths and Climbing|url=https://www.bloombergquint.com/business/flu-caused-1-in-10-american-deaths-last-week|work=Bloomberg|access-date=20 September 2020}}</ref> In the first week of February, deaths from influenza and [[pneumonia]] were responsible for one of every ten deaths in the US, with 4,064 from pneumonia or influenza recorded in the third week of 2018, according to CDC data. The CDC also reported 63 child deaths at that point, half of which were not considered medically high risk, and only about 20 percent who were vaccinated.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fortune.com/2018/02/10/american-flu-deaths/|title=The Flu is Killing Up to 4,000 Americans a Week}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-09/flu-caused-1-in-10-american-deaths-last-week|title=Flu Is Causing 1 in 10 American Deaths and Climbing|newspaper=Bloomberg |date=9 February 2018|via=www.bloomberg.com}}</ref> Only two of those deaths were babies under six months old.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.popsci.com/kids-flu-symptoms-death#page-3|title=This flu season has killed 53 kids so far.

The 2017–2018 flu season was severe for all US populations and resulted in an estimated 41 million cases, 710,000 hospitalizations and 52,000 deaths. This is the highest number of illnesses since the 2009 flu season, when there were an estimated 60 million cases.<ref name=":2" /> According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, during the 2017–2018 season the percentage of deaths attributed to pneumonia and influenza (P&I) was at or above the epidemic threshold for 16 consecutive weeks. Nationally, mortality attributed to P&I exceeded 10.0% for four consecutive weeks, peaking at 10.8% during the week ending January 20, 2018.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/2017-2018.htm|title=Estimated Influenza Illnesses, Medical visits, Hospitalizations, and Deaths in the United States — 2017–2018 influenza season {{!}} CDC|date=2019-03-26|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2019-10-30}}</ref> A preliminary estimate (September 2018) attributed more than 80,000 US deaths to influenza this season,<ref>{{cite news|date=26 September 2018|title=APNewsBreak: 80,000 people died of flu last winter in US|work=Associated Press|publisher=|url=https://apnews.com/article/health-north-america-centers-for-disease-control-and-prevention-ap-top-news-us-news-818b5360eb7d472480ebde13da5c72b5|access-date=2 February 2022}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Lindsay |first1=Paul |title=INFLUENZA AND PNEUMOCOCCAL DISEASE CAN BE SERIOUS, HEALTH OFFICIALS URGE VACCINATION |url=https://www.nfid.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/press-release-3.pdf |website=NFID |publisher=National Foundation for Infectious Diseases |access-date=4 April 2020 |archive-date=2020-03-06  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200306074502/https://www.nfid.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/press-release-3.pdf |url-status=dead }}</ref> but this was later revised down to 52,000 in light of more complete information.<ref>{{Cite web|date=22 November 2019|title=Archived Estimated Influenza Illnesses, Medical visits, Hospitalizations, and Deaths in the United States — 2017–2018 influenza season {{!}} CDC|url=https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/2017-2018/archive.htm|access-date=2 February 2022|website=www.cdc.gov}}</ref> While 186 pediatric deaths were reported to the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]],<ref name=":0" /> it is estimated that there were in reality more than 600 total pediatric deaths nationwide related to influenza.

=== New York ===
On 10 February 2018, officials in [[New York City]] confirmed the third pediatric flu death for the 2017–2018 season. The week prior, 43 states reported high patient traffic for the flu, with flu remaining widespread in each state except Hawaii and Oregon.<ref name="ABC 7 NY">{{cite web|url=http://abc7ny.com/health/nyc-confirms-3rd-child-flu-death-as-epidemic-gets-worse/3058821/|title=NYC confirms 3rd child flu death as epidemic gets worse|date=9 February 2018}}</ref>

===California===
[[California]] was hit especially hard.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Criss|first1=Doug|title=Mudslides, wildfires, earthquakes and flu. 2018's off to a rough start in California|url=http://www.cnn.com/2018/01/13/us/california-calamities-trnd/index.html|website=cnn.com|publisher=CNN|access-date=14 January 2018|language=en|date=13 January 2017}}</ref> In California as of 6 January 2018, twenty-seven people under the age of 65 died from flu since October, nine times as many as the prior year. The [[Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center]] emergency room, which often caters to about 140 patients daily, had more than 200 patients on one of those days.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-ln-flu-surge-20180106-htmlstory.html|title=Severe flu brings medicine shortages, packed ERs and a rising death toll in California|first=Soumya|last=Karlamangla|website=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=6 January 2018 |access-date=7 January 2018}}</ref> By 19 January, seventy-four people under the age of 65 had died in California, with thirty-two of those deaths occurring in the preceding week, making it the deadliest week of the flu season so far.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Karlamangla|first1=Soumya|title=Death toll jumps sharply after California experiences its worst week of the flu season – LA Times|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/la-me-ln-flu-deaths-20180119-story.html|access-date=22 January 2018|work=Los Angeles Times}}</ref>

By 9 February 2018, the national rate for flu-like symptoms for patients visiting clinics had reached "well above" seven percent, a rate last seen during the H1N1 swine flu pandemic of 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.startribune.com/minnesota-s-flu-season-is-worse-than-expected-and-it-s-not-done-yet/473589833/|title=Minnesota's flu season is worse than expected, and it's not done yet|website=[[Star Tribune]] }}</ref>  According to the ''Los Angeles Times'', 163 people under the age of 65 had died of the flu since October 2017, compared to 40 deaths during the same time period the previous year.  Of those 163 deaths, 36 had died during the first week of February; the same article also noted that the peak of the flu season has apparently passed as reports of new cases have declined.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Karlamangla|first1=Soumya|title=Flu deaths reach a high, but outbreak shows signs of easing – LA Times|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-ln-flu-rsv-20180209-htmlstory.html|access-date=9 February 2018|work=Los Angeles Times}}</ref>

===Washington state===
On 11 February 2018, the ''Seattle Times'' reported that "things [were] improving" in [[Washington (state)|Washington state]]. At the time, the state had seen 151 flu-related fatalities, lower than the total of 214 that time the year before.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/health/things-are-improving-what-you-need-to-know-about-flu-season-in-wa-state/|title='Things are improving': What you need to know about flu season in Washington state|date=9 February 2018}}</ref>

===Delaware===
On 12 February 2018, [[Delaware]] announced that it had seen six deaths and 995 confirmed flu cases in seven days, making it the state's highest weekly total on record.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.delawareonline.com/story/news/health/2018/02/12/state-6-die-flu-record-995-cases-week/328583002/|title=State: In one week 6 die of flu, record 995 cases}}</ref>

===Minnesota===
On 11 February 2018, United States Senator [[Amy Klobuchar]] from [[Minnesota]] announced a new bill called the Flu Vaccine Act, calling for further research on a better vaccine at the US [[National Institutes of Health]]. At the time, there had been 400 outbreaks of flu that season in Minnesota's schools, and 130 outbreaks in long-term care facilities, with one child in the state dying. Additionally, Klobuchar continued to push the US [[Food and Drug Administration]] to fix the national IV bag and saline shortage, for adversely affecting the treatment of flu symptoms.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://minnesota.cbslocal.com/2018/02/11/senator-amy-klobuchar-flu-bill/|title=With Flu Getting Worse, Klobuchar Calling For More Vaccine Research|date=11 February 2018}}</ref>

=== Alabama ===
On 11 January 2018, [[Alabama]] governor [[Kay Ivey]] declared a state of emergency due to the state's "overwhelmed" health care facilities, potentially affecting their ability to care for patients "in the traditional, normal, and customary manner".<ref>{{Cite web|date=11 January 2018|title=State Public Health Emergency: Influenza|url=https://governor.alabama.gov/newsroom/2018/01/state-public-health-emergency-influenza/|access-date=2 February 2022|website=governor.alabama.gov}}</ref>

==Analysis==
According to the director of the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]]'s influenza branch in January 2018, it was the first flu season where "we've had the entire continental US" show the same "widespread" flu activity, excluding the District of Columbia and Hawaii.<ref name="auto">{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2018/01/the-perfect-storm-behind-this-years-nasty-flu-season/550469/|title=The Perfect Storm Behind This Year's Nasty Flu Season|first=Sarah|last=Zhang|website=[[The Atlantic]] }}</ref> Twenty-six of those states were classified by the CDC as having "high" activity in January 2018.<ref name="auto1">{{cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/01/09/health/california-flu-season-deadly-bn/index.html|title=Deadly flu season hits California hard|first=Jacqueline |last=Howard|date=9 January 2018 |publisher=CNN}}</ref>

In January 2018, analyzing the reason for the spike, ''[[The Atlantic]]'' noted that the flu season was possibly worse because the dominant circulating strain was the H3N2 strain, which for unknown reasons tends to hit humans harder than other strains and result in worse flu seasons when dominant.<ref name="auto"/> Also, the H3N2 strain, according to the CDC, affects elderly and young children more than other strains, resulting in more severe hospitalizations and deaths.<ref name="auto1"/> 
 
''The Atlantic'' also noted that the 2017 vaccine for the flu was only ten percent effective against H3N2 in [[Australia]]. As the typical practice of studying and creating the current vaccines in chicken eggs tends to result in mutations, 2017 was the first year that researchers used dog cells rather than chicken eggs to create the H3N2 component of the vaccine Flucelvax. However, due to cost, most Americans did not get Flucelvax in 2017 and 2018 and likely received vaccines grown with chicken eggs. ''The Atlantic'' noted that the vaccine still protected against other strains such as the H1N1 and B virus, and did provide at least some immunity to H3N2.<ref name="auto"/>

In January 2018, ''The Atlantic'' also noted that the severity of the flu season in the United States may have been increased by a shortage of [[Intravenous therapy|IV bags]] in hospitals. The shortage resulted from the [[Hurricane Maria]] blackout in [[Puerto Rico]], where a large amount of medical supplies are manufactured. The article noted that  hospitals normally go through hundreds of IV bags a day to replenish fluids and give drugs, but during the shortage, some hospitals had resorted to directly injecting drugs into the vein via an [[IV push]].<ref name="auto"/> ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' also published an article in 2018 arguing that the United States had become complacent concerning the flu, and that more needed to be done.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://time.com/5107964/flu-2018-epidemic/|title=Our Complacency About the Flu is Killing Us|magazine=Time|date=19 January 2018 }}</ref>
