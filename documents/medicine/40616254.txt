'''Cell-based vaccines''' are developed from mammalian or more rarely avian or insect [[cell line]]s rather than the more common method which uses the cells in [[Embryonic stem cell|embryonic]] chicken eggs to develop the antigens.<ref name="Tannock 1483–1491" /> The potential use of [[cell culture]] techniques in developing viral vaccines has been widely investigated in the 2000s as a complementary and alternative [[Vaccine platform|platform]] to the current egg-based strategies.<ref name="Tannock 1483–1491" /><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wong SS, Webby RJ | title = Traditional and new influenza vaccines | journal = Clinical Microbiology Reviews | volume = 26 | issue = 3 | pages = 476–92 | date = July 2013 | pmid = 23824369 | pmc = 3719499 | doi = 10.1128/cmr.00097-12 | publisher = American Society for Microbiology }}</ref>

== Production ==
To produce viral vaccines, candidate vaccine viruses are grown in [[mammal]]ian, avian or insect tissue culture of cells with a finite lifespan.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Vlecken DH, Pelgrim RP, Ruminski S, Bakker WA, van der Pol LA | title = Comparison of initial feasibility of host cell lines for viral vaccine production | journal = Journal of Virological Methods | volume = 193 | issue = 1 | pages = 28–41 | date = October 2013 | pmid = 23684847 | doi = 10.1016/j.jviromet.2013.04.020 }}</ref> These cells are typically [[Madin-Darby Canine Kidney cells]],<ref name="cdc.gov">{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/flu/prevent/how-fluvaccine-made.htm |title=How Influenza (Flu) Vaccines Are Made |date=2018-09-24|publisher=[[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC)|access-date=2018-12-18}}</ref> but others are also used including monkey cell lines pMK and [[Vero cell|Vero]]  and human cell lines [[HEK 293 cells|HEK 293]], [[MRC-5|MRC 5]], Per.C6, PMK, and [[WI-38]].<ref name=":0">{{cite journal | vauthors = Perdue ML, Arnold F, Li S, Donabedian A, Cioce V, Warf T, Huebner R | s2cid = 28477882 | title = The future of cell culture-based influenza vaccine production | journal = Expert Review of Vaccines | volume = 10 | issue = 8 | pages = 1183–94 | date = August 2011 | pmid = 21854311 | doi = 10.1586/erv.11.82 }}</ref> The candidate vaccine virus strain will replicate using the mammalian cells.

== Advantages ==
The main benefit of cell-based vaccines is the ability to rapidly produce vaccine supplies during an impending [[pandemic]]. Cell-based antigen production offer a faster and more stable production of vaccines compared to embryonic chicken eggs, which produce 1-2 vaccine doses per chicken egg.<ref name = "Zahoor_2016">{{cite journal | vauthors = Zahoor MA, Khurshid M, Qureshi R, Naz A, Shahid M | title =  Cell culture-based viral vaccines: current status and future prospects. | journal = Future Virology | date = July 2016 | volume = 11 | issue = 7 | pages = 549–62 | doi = 10.2217/fvl-2016-0006 }}</ref> Though host cells replicate well in chicken eggs, vaccine production with mammalian cells would not rely on an adequate supply of chicken eggs to produce each vaccine.<ref name="Tannock 1483–1491">{{cite journal | vauthors = Audsley JM, Tannock GA | s2cid = 46960558 | title = Cell-based influenza vaccines: progress to date | journal = Drugs | volume = 68 | issue = 11 | pages = 1483–91 | date = 2008-08-01 | pmid = 18627206 | doi = 10.2165/00003495-200868110-00002 | doi-access = free }}</ref> In addition, cell-based vaccines may allow for multiple viral vaccines be produced in the same production platforms and facilities in a more sterile environment.<ref name="Tannock 1483–1491"/><ref name=":0" /> In addition, some strains do not grow well on embryonic chicken eggs.<ref name="Tannock 1483–1491"/>
