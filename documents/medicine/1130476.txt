{{For| the biological description|Small intestine}}

In [[traditional Chinese medicine]] the '''Small Intestine''' ({{zh|s=小肠|t=小腸}}) is a fu [[Organ (anatomy)|organ]] in the [[Zang-fu]] concept.

The small intestine governs the separation of the clear from the [[turbid]]. The small intestine further digests food decomposed initially by the stomach. The clear, referring to the essence of water and grain and to the large amount of fluid, is absorbed by the spleen and distributed to the whole body. The turbid is sent downwards to the large intestine, while the useless water is infused to the bladder. The disorders of the small intestine are attributable to failure to separate the clear from the turbid dirt in the digesting process, manifesting stool and urinary disturbance, such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, scanty urine, etc.<ref>The Zang-fu Organs [http://www.silkroadcn.com/chinese-medicine/m1.htm Silk Road China], Retrieved 19 January 2008  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070610095736/http://www.silkroadcn.com/chinese-medicine/m1.htm |date=June 10, 2007 }}</ref>

The Small intestine and its paired organ, the [[Heart (Chinese medicine)|Heart]], are associated with the element of fire and the emotions of joy or agitation.
