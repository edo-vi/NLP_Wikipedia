'''''Riemerella anatipestifer''''' is a member of the [[Flavobacteriaceae]] family. It is a Gram-negative [[bacterium]] that causes  [[septicaemia]] and death in young [[ducks]] and [[geese]] throughout the world. There are 21 known serotypes and infection is spread [[Horizontal transmission|horizontally]] between birds. Infection may be referred to as duck septicaemia, goose flu, riemerellosis, new duck disease and polyserositis.

==Clinical signs and diagnosis==
Clinical signs are most commonly seen in birds between the ages of 1â€“8 weeks old.

Systemic infection is most common, producing a variety of clinical signs. These include [[diarrhoea]], [[pyrexia]], [[Anorexia (symptom)|anorexia]], stunted growth, respiratory signs (e.g. [[coughing]]), neurological abnormalities (e.g. convulsions), and ocular signs. These signs are rapidly followed by death in many birds. Infection may localise in chronic cases.

On [[Autopsy|post-mortem]], a yellow-white [[exudate]] and congestion can be seen throughout the body.

The signs seen on clinical exam and postmortem are normally sufficient to make a presumptive diagnosis. This diagnosis can be confirmed using laboratory tests such as [[bacterial culture]], [[Polymerase chain reaction|PCR]] and [[ELISA]].

==Treatment and control==
[[Antibiotics]] are the treatment of choice. The type of antibiotic selected should be determined by licensing and [[Kirby-Bauer antibiotic testing|sensitivity testing]].

Both a live and inactivated [[vaccines]] are available to control the disease. Good husbandry is also an essential part of disease prevention.
