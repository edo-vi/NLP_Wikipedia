A '''conjugate vaccine''' is a type of [[subunit vaccine]] which combines a weak [[antigen]] with a strong antigen as a carrier so that the [[immune system]] has a stronger response to the weak antigen.

[[Vaccine]]s are used to prevent diseases by invoking an immune response to an antigen, part of a bacterium or virus that the immune system recognizes.<ref name=TheyWork>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/conversations/understanding-vacc-work.html|title=Understanding How Vaccines Work {{!}} CDC|date=2018-10-18|website=www.cdc.gov|access-date=2018-11-29}}</ref> This is usually accomplished with an attenuated or dead version of a pathogenic bacterium or virus in the vaccine, so that the immune system can recognize the antigen later in life.<ref name=TheyWork />

Most vaccines contain a single antigen that the body will recognize. However, the antigen of some pathogens does not elicit a strong response from the immune system, so a vaccination against this weak antigen would not protect the person later in life. In this case, a conjugate vaccine is used in order to invoke an immune system response against the weak antigen. In a conjugate vaccine, the weak antigen is covalently attached to a strong antigen, thereby eliciting a stronger immunological response to the weak antigen. Most commonly, the weak antigen is a [[polysaccharide]] that is attached to strong protein antigen. However, [[peptide]]/protein and protein/protein conjugates have also been developed.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Vaccine design : innovative approaches and novel strategies|date=2011|publisher=Caister Academic| editor1=Rappuoli, Rino.| editor2= Bagnoli, Fabio.|isbn=9781904455745|location=Norfolk, UK|oclc=630453151}}</ref>

== History ==
The idea of a conjugate vaccine first appeared in experiments involving rabbits in 1927, when the immune response to the ''Streptococcus pneumoniae'' type 3 [[polysaccharide]] antigen was increased by combining the polysaccharide antigen with a protein carrier.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Avery |first1=Ostwald |title=Chemo-immunological studies on conjugated carbohydrate-proteins: II.

The vaccine was soon incorporated with the schedule for infant immunization in the United States.<ref name=Goldblatt /> The Hib conjugate vaccine is combined with one of several different carrier proteins, such as the [[diphtheria]] [[toxoid]] or the [[tetanus]] toxoid.<ref name=Ahmad>{{Cite journal|last1=Ahmad|first1=Hussain|last2=Chapnick|first2=Edward K.|title=Conjugated Polysaccharide Vaccines|date=March 1999|journal=Infectious Disease Clinics of North America|volume=13|issue=1|pages=113–33|doi=10.1016/s0891-5520(05)70046-5|pmid=10198795|issn=0891-5520}}</ref> Soon after the vaccine was made available the rates of Hib infection dropped, with a decrease of 90.7% between 1987 and 1991.<ref name=Ahmad /> Infection rates diminished even more once the vaccine was made available for infants.<ref name=Ahmad />

== Technique ==
Vaccines evoke an immune response to an antigen, and the immune system reacts by producing T cells and antibodies.<ref name=TheyWork /> The B memory cells remember the antigen so that if the body encounters it later, antibodies can be produced by B cells to break down the antigen. For bacteria with a polysaccharide coating, the immune response creates [[B cell]]s independent of [[T cell]] stimulation.<ref>{{Cite journal|vauthors=Lee C, Lee LH, Koizumi K|date=2002|title=Polysaccharide Vaccines for Prevention of Encapsulated Bacterial Infections: Part 1|journal=Infect. Med.|volume=19|pages=127–33}}</ref> By conjugating the polysaccharide to a protein carrier, a T cell response can be induced. Normally, polysaccharides by themselves cannot be loaded onto the [[major histocompatibility complex]] (MHC) of [[Antigen-presenting cell|antigen presenting cells]] (APC) because MHC can only bind peptides. In the case of a conjugate vaccine, the carrier peptide linked to the polysaccharide target antigen is able to be presented on the MHC molecule and the T cell can be activated. This improves the vaccine as T cells stimulate a more vigorous immune response and also promote a more rapid and long-lasting immunologic memory. The conjugation of polysaccharide target antigen to the carrier protein also increases efficiency of the vaccine, as a non conjugated vaccine against the polysaccharide antigen is not effective in young children.<ref name=Ahmad /> The immune systems of young children are not able to recognize the antigen as the polysaccharide covering disguises the antigen.<ref name=TheyWork /> By combining the bacterial polysaccharide with another antigen, the immune system is able to respond.{{citation needed|date=March 2022}}

The most commonly used conjugate vaccine is the [[Hib vaccine|Hib conjugate vaccine]]. Other pathogens that are combined in a conjugate vaccine to increase an immune response are ''[[Streptococcus pneumoniae]]'' (see [[pneumococcal conjugate vaccine]]) and ''[[Neisseria meningitidis]]'' (see [[meningococcal vaccine]]), both of which are conjugated to protein carriers like those used in the Hib conjugate vaccine.<ref name=Ahmad /> Both ''Streptococcus pneumoniae'' and ''Neisseria meningitidis'' are similar to Hib in that infection can lead to meningitis.<ref name=Ahmad />
