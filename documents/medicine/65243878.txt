The '''secret practice''' ({{IPA-fr|səkʁɛ|lang}}), or '''practice of secrecy''' ({{lang-fr|pratique du secret}}), is a [[folk healing]] practice, encountered in some European countries, particularly in [[Francophone]] [[Alps|Alpine]] communities, such as [[Romand Switzerland]]<ref name=houseofswitzerland>{{Cite web|title=The mystery of the 'faiseurs de secret'|url=https://houseofswitzerland.org/swissstories/society/mystery-faiseurs-de-secret|access-date=2020-09-06|website=House of Switzerland|language=en}}</ref> and [[Aosta Valley]],<ref>(in French) Florence Cout, ''Secret. Formules de guérison utilisées en Vallée d'Aoste'', éd. Priuli & Verlucca, 2010.</ref> and probably dating back to the Christian [[Middle Ages]].

== Description ==
Practitioners are known as ''faiseurs de secret'' (French for "makers of the secret") or ''guérisseurs'' (French for "healers").<ref name=houseofswitzerland/><ref>{{Cite web|last=Jaques|first=David|date=June 2008|title=Le secret : Croyances, guérisseurs et communauté|url=http://www.medecine.unige.ch/enseignement/apprentissage/module4/immersion/archives/2007_2008/travaux/08_p_secret.pdf|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=6 September 2020|website=www.medecine.unige.ch|publisher=University of Geneva Faculty of Medicine|language=fr}}</ref>

The practice involves treating certain ailments with a formula, generally a short [[prayer]] often associated with a few gestures made by the hand or fingers towards the patient's body, such as a [[sign of the cross]] for example. 

This whole process is called a "secret" insofar as it is known only to its practitioners and its disclosure to third parties is supposed to make it lose its effectiveness. It was not until shortly before his death that the secret maker is supposed to pass it on. The transmission is traditionally, but not always, made to one of their descendants or another member of their family.<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Secret Order of Swiss Medical Saviors|url=https://getpocket.com/explore/item/the-secret-order-of-swiss-medical-saviors|access-date=2020-09-06|website=Pocket}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/468760730|title=Le livre des secrets : les mots et les gestes qui guérissent|date=2001|publisher=Dervy|last=Camus|first=Dominique|isbn=2-84454-122-4|location=Paris|oclc=468760730|language=fr}}</ref>
