'''Climatotherapy''' refers to temporary or permanent relocation of a patient to a region with a [[climate]] more favourable to recovery from or management of a condition. Examples include:
* The [[partial pressure]] of oxygen is lower at high altitude, so person with [[sickle cell disease]] might move to a lower altitude to reduce the number of sickle crises.<ref name="urlSickle Cell Disease-What Increases Your Risk">{{cite web |url=http://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/sickle-cell-disease-what-increases-your-risk |title=Sickle Cell Disease-What Increases Your Risk |format= |accessdate=}}</ref><!-- This is ''awfully'' close to [[WP:SYN]], as the source does not make any connection to "climatotherapy". -->
* Several sites around the world are advertised or studied as possibly of therapeutic benefit to patients with [[psoriasis]], most notably the [[Dead Sea]] region.<ref>[http://www.psoriasis.org/treatment/psoriasis/sun/other_sites.php Climatotherapy sites] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20050612073241/http://www.psoriasis.org/treatment/psoriasis/sun/other_sites.php |date=2005-06-12 }} National Psoriasis Foundation</ref><ref name=Hodak2003>{{Cite journal
