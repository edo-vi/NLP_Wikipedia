The philosophy of information (PI) is a branch of philosophy that studies topics relevant to information processing representational system and consciousness cognitive science computer science information science and information technology.

It includes:
 the critical investigation of the conceptual nature and basic principles of information including its dynamics utilisation and sciences
 the elaboration and application of information theory
History
The philosophy of information (PI) has evolved from the philosophy of artificial intelligence logic of information cybernetics social theory ethics and the study of language and information.

Logic of information
The logic of information also known as the logical theory of information considers the information content of logical sign (semiotics)
Study of language and information
Later contributions to the field were made by Fred Dretske Jon Barwise Brian Cantwell Smith and others.

The Center for the Study of Language and Information
P.I.
More recently this field has become known as the philosophy of information. The expression was coined in the 1990s by Luciano Floridi who has published prolifically in this area with the intention of elaborating a unified and coherent conceptual frame for the whole subject.

Definitions of "information"
The concept information has been defined by several theorists.

Charles S. Peirces theory of information was embedded in his wider theory of symbolic communication he called the semiotic now a major part of semiotics. For Peirce information integrates the aspects of signs and Expression (mathematics)
Donald M. MacKay says that information is a distinction that makes a difference.<ref>The Philosophy of Information.

According to Luciano Floridi four kinds of mutually compatible phenomena are commonly referred to as "information": 
*  Information about something (e.g. a train timetable)
*  Information as something (e.g. DNA or fingerprints)
*  Information for something (e.g. algorithms or instructions)
*  Information in something (e.g. a pattern or a constraint).

Philosophical directions

Computing and philosophy

Recent creative advances and efforts in computing such as semantic web ontology engineering knowledge engineering and modern artificial intelligence provide philosophy with fertile ideas new and evolving subject matters methodologies and models for philosophical inquiry. While computer science brings new opportunities and challenges to traditional philosophical studies and changes the ways philosophers understand foundational concepts in philosophy further major progress in computer science would only be feasible when philosophy provides sound foundations for areas such as bioinformatics software engineering knowledge engineering and ontologies.

Classical topics in philosophy namely mind consciousness experience reasoning knowledge truth morality and creativity are rapidly becoming common concerns and foci of investigation in computer science e.g. in areas such as agent computing software agents and intelligent mobile agent technologies.

According to Luciano Floridi " one can think of several ways for applying computational methods towards philosophical matters:
 Conceptual experiments in silico: As an innovative extension of an ancient tradition of thought experiment a trend has begun in philosophy to apply computational Computer model Pancomputationalism: On this view computational and informational concepts are considered to be so powerful that given the right level of abstraction anything in the world could be modeled and represented as a computational system and any process could be simulated computationally. Then however pancomputationalists have the hard task of providing credible answers to the following two questions:
 how can one avoid blurring all differences among systems?
 what would it mean for the system under investigation not to be an Information system
