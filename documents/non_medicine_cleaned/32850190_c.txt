Brucella ovis is a Gram-negative coccobacillus from the Brucellaceae family.  Along with Brucella melitensis it is responsible for causing ovine brucellosis which is a notifiable disease. B. ovis can be transmitted by the stable fly. Infection causes severe inflammation of the epididymis particularly the tail.
