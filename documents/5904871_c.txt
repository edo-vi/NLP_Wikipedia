The abbreviation kyr means "thousand years".

kyr was formerly common in some English language works especially in geology and astronomy for the physical unit
Occasionally the "k" is shown in upper case as in "100 Kyr"; this is an incorrect usage.  "kyr" itself is often considered incorrect with some preferring to use "ky".

ISO 80000-3 recommends usage of ka (for kiloannum) which avoids the implicit English bias of "year" by using a Latin root.
